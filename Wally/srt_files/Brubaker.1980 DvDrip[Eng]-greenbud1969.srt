1
00:02:05,421 --> 00:02:07,965
- What do you got?
- Man with a little rabbit in him.

2
00:02:08,132 --> 00:02:09,342
Throw him on.

3
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:13,680
Those guys with the guns.
- Convicts.

4
00:02:14,305 --> 00:02:17,642
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Wakefield prisoners.

5
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:19,477
Same as us.

6
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:34,034
He's not gonna make it.

7
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,082
Take these boys on back.
I'll talk to you later.

8
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:45,337
One of you cons trying for parole?

9
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:12,407
Come on. Up. Up.

10
00:03:12,574 --> 00:03:15,243
You guys hit bottom.

11
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:26,255
Here you go.

12
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:02,292
In there.

13
00:04:06,796 --> 00:04:08,882
Follow me.

14
00:04:12,511 --> 00:04:14,554
In there.

15
00:04:32,615 --> 00:04:34,700
That's it for you.

16
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,371
Okay, next man.

17
00:04:45,086 --> 00:04:47,422
Let's just take a little off
around the ears.

18
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:49,799
Cost five to get you
no haircut, Zaranska.

19
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:54,721
- Two only gets you a crew cut.
- I'll tell you when. You.

20
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:57,891
Fuck it, I can use this on a bed.

21
00:04:58,058 --> 00:05:02,145
It'll all come off then.
Maybe an ear with it.

22
00:05:02,396 --> 00:05:05,065
Hey, man, what happened
to that guy on the bus?

23
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:09,236
You don't talk to me unless I tell you to.

24
00:05:09,403 --> 00:05:10,988
You hear?

25
00:05:11,155 --> 00:05:12,865
Yeah.

26
00:05:18,162 --> 00:05:20,748
BARBER:
What's it be, my man?

27
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,334
Leave the ears.

28
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:26,212
I'm getting ready to come on in.

29
00:05:41,144 --> 00:05:43,563
Fresh meat coming in.

30
00:05:55,534 --> 00:05:58,745
Where in the hell's Lamar at?
He don't have the job no more?

31
00:05:58,912 --> 00:06:02,708
What's it look like?
I'm the man in here.

32
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:07,755
Come on, I'll show you where you sleep.

33
00:06:07,922 --> 00:06:11,175
Rest of you men, grab a blanket,
find some room on the floor.

34
00:06:11,342 --> 00:06:14,428
We talk about beds when somebody
gets out of here or dies.

35
00:06:17,807 --> 00:06:19,642
- Come here.
- Move it down.

36
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:22,061
Let's go, every other one.

37
00:06:23,438 --> 00:06:25,523
Come on down here.

38
00:06:26,107 --> 00:06:28,484
Let's go, move it on down.

39
00:06:28,651 --> 00:06:31,529
- What the hell you looking at?
- Move on down there.

40
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:48,255
Come on, let's go.

41
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:51,383
Come on, move it down.

42
00:06:57,097 --> 00:06:59,558
Come on, move it on down.

43
00:07:02,395 --> 00:07:03,979
Fucking showers.

44
00:07:04,146 --> 00:07:07,900
These goddamn showers
ain't got no hot water.

45
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:12,280
Let me go! No!

46
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:32,050
You're over there, buddy. Eat all that.

47
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:04,083
Come on, boy. What is the matter?
You playing hard to get?

48
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,127
Let go.

49
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,717
No, stop it.

50
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,596
Get your own soap, you understand?

51
00:08:34,573 --> 00:08:36,408
Mr. Caldwell.

52
00:08:41,372 --> 00:08:45,584
Lord, you're getting fat, aren't you?

53
00:08:45,751 --> 00:08:47,587
Stay out of my face, motherfucker.

54
00:08:47,753 --> 00:08:49,964
- Hey, Huey.
- Floyd.

55
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:54,927
Hey, Huey, how's about that game?

56
00:08:55,553 --> 00:09:01,267
I'm getting ready to be angry, Abraham.
I'm getting ready to be real angry.

57
00:09:18,744 --> 00:09:20,829
Oh, look at her go.

58
00:09:20,996 --> 00:09:23,749
Yeah, she goes up on the inside.

59
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,085
She's still behind her.

60
00:09:27,336 --> 00:09:31,006
And look out. She threw
a left hand at her. Back again.

61
00:09:31,173 --> 00:09:34,135
Tried to lift the bigger gal off her feet.

62
00:09:39,223 --> 00:09:42,226
I'm going up to the house.
New people came in today.

63
00:09:42,393 --> 00:09:45,313
I think they need to go to school,
so run upstairs...

64
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,482
...and show them what the picture is.

65
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:49,817
When this is over.

66
00:09:50,777 --> 00:09:53,113
Now, Eddie.

67
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,407
Where's my boots?

68
00:09:56,574 --> 00:09:59,744
And she scores two points.
That makes 40.

69
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:01,288
Walter.

70
00:10:01,455 --> 00:10:03,665
Coming in, Otis.

71
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,544
Man gonna ride the hide, Otis.

72
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:35,323
Hey, man, I told you
I ain't have no match, man.

73
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,204
Spivey, they want you
down at the bars, boy.

74
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:44,332
- Down at the bars, captain?
- You heard me. Now move.

75
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:46,751
- The bars?
- Goddamn it, I said move!

76
00:10:46,918 --> 00:10:49,754
I ain't got all fucking night! Now move!

77
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:53,341
Why the bars, captain?
I didn't do nothing.

78
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:56,553
I didn't do nothing, captain.

79
00:11:00,349 --> 00:11:02,434
I didn't do nothing.

80
00:11:11,402 --> 00:11:14,113
Now drop them pants and get
on that gate.

81
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,449
But I didn't do nothing.

82
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:22,622
I didn't do nothing.

83
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,793
Damn.

84
00:11:27,418 --> 00:11:30,338
- How many licks you recollect that is?
- That's three.

85
00:11:30,505 --> 00:11:31,965
- Three what?
- Three, cap.

86
00:11:32,132 --> 00:11:33,591
- And what's that?!
- Four, cap!

87
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:35,301
- And what's that?!
- Five!

88
00:11:35,468 --> 00:11:39,014
- Can't hear you!
- Six, cap! Seven, cap!

89
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,766
Eight, cap! Nine, cap!

90
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:45,145
That's 10, cap! Eleven, cap!

91
00:11:45,312 --> 00:11:48,315
That's 12, cap!

92
00:11:52,152 --> 00:11:55,447
- Hang him up.
- Open the gate, Otis.

93
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,908
What the hell are you looking at?

94
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:17,762
Pick it up.

95
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:20,223
Pick it up. Pick it up.

96
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,186
- Moving out.
- Move out.

97
00:12:50,546 --> 00:12:53,174
Let's see you swing them hoes.

98
00:12:58,304 --> 00:13:01,307
All right, you boys, swing them hoes.

99
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:04,560
Now get in between.

100
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,157
You coming down
to the office today, Captain Renfro?

101
00:13:17,324 --> 00:13:20,785
Because I wrote them letters like you
wanted. Maybe you wanna look at them.

102
00:13:20,952 --> 00:13:23,121
What are we gonna do about my brother?

103
00:13:23,288 --> 00:13:26,708
Give your brother a call.
Tell him I'll send ten boys over.

104
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:30,337
Wash out his milk machinery
on Tuesday.

105
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:18,929
Get yourself cleaned up, boy.

106
00:14:55,091 --> 00:14:57,802
- Hey, baby.
- You coming to see me tonight, sweetie?

107
00:14:57,969 --> 00:15:00,055
I think he's blushing.

108
00:15:04,476 --> 00:15:06,645
- Why, you....
Beat him up, J.B.

109
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:10,315
Sucker, you're in trouble,
you know that? You're in trouble.

110
00:15:11,066 --> 00:15:13,527
Beat him up, J.B. Beat him up.

111
00:15:18,324 --> 00:15:20,492
What's going on over here?!

112
00:15:22,244 --> 00:15:26,582
Bullen, Elwood, over here.
Come on, come on.

113
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:30,086
You're fixing to get yourself
over to Camp Five.

114
00:15:30,253 --> 00:15:32,922
Thanks, man.
- You're the dumbest asshole yet.

115
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:36,426
- Ain't you got enough shit on you?
- Put him down on the ground.

116
00:15:36,592 --> 00:15:38,428
Do it, Bullen.

117
00:15:38,595 --> 00:15:41,347
Now put the gun on him. Do it, boy.

118
00:15:45,226 --> 00:15:49,773
- Get him down and hold him down.
- That's what I'm doing, Birdwell.

119
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,025
You all look here now.

120
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:56,530
Shut up.

121
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,381
All right, that's it.

122
00:16:15,466 --> 00:16:17,718
We got a long night together...

123
00:16:18,219 --> 00:16:21,472
...and I don't want to hear
nothing but snoring.

124
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:42,244
Well, you know you can't win them all.
No, I'll give you another shot. I promise.

125
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,163
Nope. All right, now.
We'll see you later.

126
00:16:45,747 --> 00:16:50,002
- If my hospital calls, you ain't seen me.
- You got it, doc. Hey, what about him?

127
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,756
- I'll see him next week.
- Want me to do anything to him?

128
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:56,633
I'll take care of you in a minute.

129
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:02,515
No, sign says four today for blood.

130
00:17:02,681 --> 00:17:05,559
Yeah? Don't believe
everything you read, Zaranska.

131
00:17:11,274 --> 00:17:13,401
- Hey, give me a sandwich.
- Fifty cents.

132
00:17:13,568 --> 00:17:16,696
Man, I know what it is.
Man, give me a sandwich.

133
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:23,161
Give me a sandwich, buddy.

134
00:17:27,707 --> 00:17:29,459
Sandwich.

135
00:17:29,626 --> 00:17:31,586
Fresh out this morning.

136
00:17:31,753 --> 00:17:34,047
Why don't you have a look around?

137
00:17:40,137 --> 00:17:43,348
Are you finished with that,
Mr. Caldwell?

138
00:17:43,515 --> 00:17:45,517
Two bits.

139
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:52,566
- Fifty cents.
- Seventy-five.

140
00:17:52,775 --> 00:17:54,443
What?

141
00:17:55,444 --> 00:17:57,321
Sold.

142
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,499
You just cost me 50 cents
that was needed elsewhere.

143
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:37,655
Go ahead. It's protein.

144
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,161
No, don't. Stop it.
No, come on.

145
00:18:44,328 --> 00:18:47,289
Wait! No, please don't!

146
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,501
Stop it! Let me go!

147
00:18:50,668 --> 00:18:52,670
No!

148
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:59,302
No, let me go! Let me go! Stop it!

149
00:19:57,862 --> 00:20:00,448
- Climb in the truck.
- Hey, Rauch. Rauch!

150
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:04,369
Where you going with those boys?
I gotta get this stuff milled today.

151
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,247
I gotta tell my insurance company
what my inventory is.

152
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,541
Mr. Woodward,
I gave you 20 people today...

153
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,628
...and I'm down on my count.
I got people all over.

154
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:18,092
- I don't care other people's problems.
- All right, I almost forgot this.

155
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:21,303
I got you a nice sirloin tip here.

156
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,559
Warden Renfro's gonna hear direct
you don't come through on this.

157
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,103
Now, sir, don't you worry.

158
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:57,883
This one, up it. Let's go.

159
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,803
Hey, I'll take it.

160
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,639
Thanks, man.

161
00:21:09,812 --> 00:21:13,274
Hey, I do that. I do that.

162
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:22,408
- Where's my meat?
- It's coming in the back there.

163
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:29,624
What? You told me two steers.
That ain't two steers.

164
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:33,795
- Sorry, I couldn't do it this week.
- Hey, don't tell me couldn't.

165
00:21:33,962 --> 00:21:36,381
Suppose I can't spare you
no beer this week.

166
00:21:36,548 --> 00:21:39,843
I'll make it up to you. All right?

167
00:21:44,055 --> 00:21:46,141
Where's Carol at?

168
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:48,810
Back at the house.

169
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:52,022
RAUCH:
Back to truck.

170
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:14,796
For another 20, I'll give you the
name of a stoolie who knows cannons.

171
00:22:14,962 --> 00:22:18,800
- You give me back my dough.
- Who told you to ask me?

172
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:22,846
- The pin boy in the bowling alley.
- Who told you to ask him?

173
00:22:23,012 --> 00:22:26,516
A fella that works
at the Houston Street auction shop.

174
00:22:27,225 --> 00:22:31,021
- Oh, shit!
- Wash your mouth out.

175
00:22:35,525 --> 00:22:39,905
- What time you coming up there tonight?
- I can't, my brother's got me working.

176
00:22:40,072 --> 00:22:41,990
- Your brother's got you working?
- Mm-hmm.

177
00:22:42,157 --> 00:22:46,078
No, he doesn't, because I just
bought you the night off.

178
00:23:02,637 --> 00:23:05,681
What are you doing?
Get on those logs and start moving them.

179
00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:09,060
- You move them, asshole.
- You're asking for it, boy.

180
00:23:16,735 --> 00:23:18,320
Floyd!

181
00:23:18,486 --> 00:23:19,738
Yeah, Huey?

182
00:23:19,904 --> 00:23:22,115
What do you got them doing?
Taking a nap?

183
00:23:22,282 --> 00:23:24,618
What are you doing?
Get back to work now.

184
00:23:24,785 --> 00:23:26,495
- Huey, don't get excited-
- Floyd!

185
00:23:26,661 --> 00:23:28,997
Hey, Huey, take it easy now.
Let me explain-

186
00:23:29,164 --> 00:23:31,458
Floyd, shut up, will you?

187
00:24:01,614 --> 00:24:05,034
All right, just for that
it went up to six bits. Six bits.

188
00:24:05,702 --> 00:24:07,829
They want you up at the bars, Bullen.

189
00:24:07,996 --> 00:24:12,042
All right, who wants it, man?
The last peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

190
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:14,669
Half a rock. Who wants it?

191
00:24:29,351 --> 00:24:31,687
You got yourself a phone call.

192
00:24:31,854 --> 00:24:33,564
Fuck.

193
00:24:34,356 --> 00:24:37,360
Look here, Eddie. Why a phone call?

194
00:24:37,526 --> 00:24:39,570
- Let's go.
- A phone call?

195
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,907
Why a fucking phone call?!

196
00:24:43,074 --> 00:24:46,035
Hey. Psst. What's-?

197
00:24:46,202 --> 00:24:47,912
What's with the phone call?

198
00:24:58,882 --> 00:25:01,968
I'm getting ready to say
something important now.

199
00:25:02,135 --> 00:25:04,805
I wanna know that when
I talk I'm being listened to.

200
00:25:05,138 --> 00:25:09,643
I'm getting ready to give out the detail.
Leonard, I want you to go to kitchen.

201
00:25:10,102 --> 00:25:11,603
Collins.

202
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,648
- Boiler house.
- Sanitation detail.

203
00:25:14,815 --> 00:25:16,942
You too, Bullen.

204
00:25:17,443 --> 00:25:19,278
Wait a minute. This man is hurt-

205
00:25:19,445 --> 00:25:23,157
You just deal with colored.
I'll take care of the white folks, okay?

206
00:25:24,575 --> 00:25:27,244
Besides, I don't think Bullen's
got much more than...

207
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:29,956
...refried shit for brains this morning.

208
00:25:30,122 --> 00:25:33,626
Now what about your boy
Boyd for clerical?

209
00:25:55,482 --> 00:25:58,193
Come on, come on.
We ain't got all day.

210
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,043
Hey!

211
00:26:56,545 --> 00:26:59,214
I got me a convict here!

212
00:27:02,468 --> 00:27:04,053
I'll rip this cat's head off!

213
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,723
You get me the man!
I wanna see the man, now!

214
00:27:08,724 --> 00:27:10,643
I can hear his neck snapping.

215
00:27:12,061 --> 00:27:14,397
Shit. I want some respect.

216
00:27:16,232 --> 00:27:19,652
You sons of bitches hear me out there?
I want some respect!

217
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:21,821
Yeah, we hear you, Walter. We hear you.

218
00:27:21,988 --> 00:27:23,823
I want to see the man!

219
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,409
I hear his neck snapping. I do!

220
00:27:27,243 --> 00:27:29,079
- Open this.
- Where are you at?

221
00:27:29,245 --> 00:27:31,039
- You want in?
- Open- Yeah.

222
00:27:31,206 --> 00:27:34,501
Some fucking respect around here.

223
00:27:35,252 --> 00:27:37,921
R-E-S-P-E-C-T!

224
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,194
- Stand still.
- Hey!

225
00:28:03,698 --> 00:28:05,199
We talk?

226
00:28:05,366 --> 00:28:07,952
Who the fuck are you? I want the man!

227
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,955
I am. I am the man.

228
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:14,542
I'm the new warden here.
My name's Henry Brubaker.

229
00:28:23,051 --> 00:28:25,137
Man, don't be fucking with my head.

230
00:28:25,887 --> 00:28:28,098
- New warden, my ass.
- It's true. I swear it.

231
00:28:28,265 --> 00:28:33,186
- Then how come you look like a scumbag?
- Because I'm fooling those guys out there.

232
00:28:59,922 --> 00:29:02,675
- When you gonna paint this place?
- What color?

233
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:08,473
Yellow.

234
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,767
- Yellow.
- Yellow.

235
00:29:11,518 --> 00:29:14,187
And I want a picture window in my place.

236
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,023
This yours? This one?

237
00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:23,155
One of them high-low pinto shag rugs...

238
00:29:23,322 --> 00:29:29,328
...and some liquor and a TV
like them fucking trusties all got.

239
00:29:31,664 --> 00:29:33,415
Some fresh air.

240
00:29:37,545 --> 00:29:39,505
Which wall?

241
00:29:41,007 --> 00:29:44,677
- Which wall what?
- The picture window.

242
00:29:44,844 --> 00:29:47,346
Come on, show me exactly.

243
00:30:08,034 --> 00:30:10,704
Maybe I want a skylight.

244
00:30:11,371 --> 00:30:14,416
Yeah, I want a- I want a skylight.

245
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,256
How you doing?

246
00:30:21,423 --> 00:30:22,591
- Open this.
- Do what?

247
00:30:22,758 --> 00:30:25,928
Open it up. Get this man
some medical attention.

248
00:30:26,095 --> 00:30:28,472
Get this place dried out and painted up.

249
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:30,725
What color?

250
00:30:31,058 --> 00:30:35,271
- Any fucking color he wants.
- Everybody crazy around here.

251
00:30:35,438 --> 00:30:37,565
- Where you going now?
- My office.

252
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,446
Mess with me now,
you're gonna regret it later.

253
00:30:43,613 --> 00:30:46,282
We don't work this out fast,
you won't be around later.

254
00:30:46,449 --> 00:30:47,617
Do you want ID?

255
00:30:47,784 --> 00:30:51,329
Listen, if I raise my right hand,
that tower guard will blow you out.

256
00:30:51,496 --> 00:30:56,543
Or you can continue walking with me,
like the smart escort I figure you to be.

257
00:31:14,353 --> 00:31:15,813
Hey! Hey!

258
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,607
- Hold it right there.
- I'm sorry. I'm replacing you.

259
00:31:18,774 --> 00:31:19,984
Coombes, give me a hand.

260
00:31:20,151 --> 00:31:22,445
Call Lillian Gray,
assistant to the governor.

261
00:31:22,612 --> 00:31:25,656
- Who is this asshole?
- Beats the shit out of me.

262
00:31:25,823 --> 00:31:28,493
- The name is Brubaker.
- He thinks he's the new warden.

263
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:31,329
I didn't want it this way,
but that's the way it is.

264
00:31:31,496 --> 00:31:33,206
What is?

265
00:31:33,373 --> 00:31:35,792
What is?

266
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:37,502
You're Willets? Earl?

267
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:39,963
- Burl.
- Burl, right.

268
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,591
State employee, purchasing agent.

269
00:31:42,757 --> 00:31:47,095
You've been here, uh, uh,
three years, uh, next May.

270
00:31:47,262 --> 00:31:48,847
Five years in Ju- July.

271
00:31:49,014 --> 00:31:50,974
Government service ranking is seven.

272
00:31:51,141 --> 00:31:54,978
You're due for an ingrade raise in May.

273
00:31:55,145 --> 00:31:58,273
Yes, sir. That part's all true.

274
00:32:03,737 --> 00:32:05,030
- Captain?
- Yeah?

275
00:32:05,197 --> 00:32:08,200
This is a hell of a note,
that's all I've got to say.

276
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:11,412
- I mean it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

277
00:32:18,378 --> 00:32:22,048
I'll make sure all your magazines
get forwarded. Don't worry.

278
00:32:25,552 --> 00:32:27,220
You know something, Mr. Brubaker?

279
00:32:27,387 --> 00:32:30,390
Smartest thing you ever done
was come in here incognizant.

280
00:32:30,557 --> 00:32:33,268
Dumbest was stepping forward.

281
00:32:33,435 --> 00:32:37,606
You want it? You got it. Bye.

282
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:47,199
Can you hear me-?

283
00:32:49,243 --> 00:32:50,953
Can you hear me?

284
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,373
The name is Henry Brubaker.
I'm what the new governor promised.

285
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,167
A reform warden.

286
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:59,754
That sneaks in like
James-fucking-Bond!

287
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:06,594
Purcell? Here, give me that.

288
00:33:09,931 --> 00:33:12,058
See this? This thing is gone.

289
00:33:14,853 --> 00:33:17,397
Any trusty wants to go back
to raking rocks...

290
00:33:17,564 --> 00:33:20,692
...just get caught using this
on one of your charges.

291
00:33:21,484 --> 00:33:26,865
If an inmate is to attempt an escape,
should we just sort of wave so long or-

292
00:33:27,032 --> 00:33:29,117
- Shoot him.
- We can't hear you over here.

293
00:33:29,284 --> 00:33:33,247
He asked me what happens if an inmate
tries to escape. I said, "Shoot him. "

294
00:33:33,413 --> 00:33:35,666
Wound him because nobody's
getting paroled...

295
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:38,293
...for trying to kill escaping inmates.

296
00:33:40,212 --> 00:33:45,301
Let's get something straight.
I figure most of you guys belong here.

297
00:33:46,135 --> 00:33:50,348
I figure basically you don't have any
respect for other people or yourselves.

298
00:33:50,723 --> 00:33:53,434
You want more from me,
you're gonna have to earn it.

299
00:33:55,728 --> 00:33:59,732
We're gonna figure out some way to make
this run like a 20th century farm.

300
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:02,819
You're gonna stop selling blood
to buy decent food.

301
00:34:02,986 --> 00:34:05,446
You'll go in those fields
and plant vegetables.

302
00:34:05,947 --> 00:34:08,032
What you got your bubbles on for,
Cleaves?

303
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,577
Mr. Deach, ain't no woman
can come in here.

304
00:34:11,494 --> 00:34:13,663
It's all right, Ruben.

305
00:34:14,831 --> 00:34:18,335
From now on, no more 15-hour shifts.

306
00:34:18,502 --> 00:34:20,337
The beef you raise on this farm...

307
00:34:20,504 --> 00:34:24,424
...is gonna be eaten on this farm
by everyone.

308
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,095
What the-?

309
00:34:30,514 --> 00:34:34,435
He was an army lieutenant.
He ran a military stockade in Maryland.

310
00:34:34,602 --> 00:34:36,437
- to enforce the laws of this state.

311
00:34:36,604 --> 00:34:37,813
This is ridiculous.

312
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,525
I found him teaching penology at
Price University three years-

313
00:34:41,692 --> 00:34:43,194
Hold on. How old are you?

314
00:34:43,444 --> 00:34:44,862
- Forty.
- Forty.

315
00:34:45,029 --> 00:34:48,032
To enforce the laws of this state
and of the United States.

316
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,451
- This is ridiculous.
- "To enforce the laws-"

317
00:34:50,618 --> 00:34:52,954
- We've got-
- I understand your problem.

318
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:55,790
- prison without taking a loyalty oath.

319
00:34:55,957 --> 00:35:00,003
- I stressed to the governor
the promise that he clean up the prisons...

320
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:03,506
...if he got elected,
and he always delivers on his promises.

321
00:35:03,673 --> 00:35:06,718
- To be respectful to my superiors.
- A couple of weeks.

322
00:35:06,885 --> 00:35:09,596
Yeah, Brubaker was in as a rankman
for a couple weeks.

323
00:35:09,763 --> 00:35:14,059
- No publicity on how I came in here.
- You got some good men on your side.

324
00:35:14,226 --> 00:35:16,979
- Hey, it's good, strong stuff.
- I know what I'm saying.

325
00:35:17,146 --> 00:35:19,356
- No publicity.
- I quite agree.

326
00:35:19,857 --> 00:35:21,108
Kill that last part.

327
00:35:21,275 --> 00:35:23,402
I don't know how you pulled this off...

328
00:35:23,569 --> 00:35:26,655
...but I can't be kept in the dark
on something like this.

329
00:35:26,822 --> 00:35:30,743
And Lillian knows that now.
Chairman of the Prison Board...

330
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:33,579
...must approve everything
pertaining to the prison.

331
00:35:33,746 --> 00:35:37,125
I hope you're not one of those people
gonna start screaming...

332
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:38,626
...for free-world guards.

333
00:35:38,793 --> 00:35:41,671
I don't know. How long have
you been on the Prison Board?

334
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:44,716
- Did I say that? Brilliant.
- Seventeen years this summer.

335
00:35:44,883 --> 00:35:47,886
Print it. Credit the governor. Bye-bye.

336
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:52,098
Well, John, what do you think
of our new warden?

337
00:35:52,265 --> 00:35:58,271
I'm trying to get a fix on what his first
order of business here is gonna be.

338
00:35:58,897 --> 00:36:02,818
Blow the place up. Start from scratch.

339
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:07,656
You're making a joke, of course.

340
00:36:11,994 --> 00:36:13,829
Of course.

341
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,623
Yes.

342
00:36:29,846 --> 00:36:31,639
- Learn much?
- Not enough.

343
00:36:32,348 --> 00:36:36,102
- I've never seen anything like this place.
- There isn't anything like it.

344
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:38,938
Understand the problem's
not just inside the prison.

345
00:36:39,105 --> 00:36:41,524
I do. That's why
I have to move so fast.

346
00:36:41,691 --> 00:36:43,860
Carefully.

347
00:36:44,027 --> 00:36:47,489
- It's the same thing, Lillian.
- Henry, this is very important to me.

348
00:36:47,656 --> 00:36:49,282
No kidding.

349
00:36:51,952 --> 00:36:55,747
You're one of the strangest individuals
I've ever laid my eyes on.

350
00:36:56,456 --> 00:37:00,127
I've got an 11:00, Lillian.
What's the problem?

351
00:37:00,294 --> 00:37:04,381
She was saying you're one of the most
punctual individuals she's worked with.

352
00:37:04,548 --> 00:37:08,344
- I'll call you later in the week.
- I know you will.

353
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:15,226
- Man, this is pathetic.
- That's it.

354
00:37:15,393 --> 00:37:17,728
- This just don't cut it.
- That's all I've got.

355
00:37:17,895 --> 00:37:19,230
Well, you're out of luck.

356
00:37:19,397 --> 00:37:22,525
Look, I needs a supervisor's
desk job like you.

357
00:37:22,692 --> 00:37:24,861
Anyway, you's overworked.

358
00:37:25,028 --> 00:37:27,280
Hey, man, it ain't up to me alone.

359
00:37:29,365 --> 00:37:31,868
- Purcell, can I see you a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

360
00:37:32,035 --> 00:37:33,995
Oh, I gotta-

361
00:37:35,539 --> 00:37:38,083
I love what you did
with old John Deach out there.

362
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,544
A lot of people gonna get
a kick out of that.

363
00:37:40,711 --> 00:37:44,381
- The day that-
- Who was that lady out there, by the way?

364
00:37:46,049 --> 00:37:50,971
The day that I came in on the bus,
trusties put a man on. Gunshot wound.

365
00:37:51,263 --> 00:37:53,057
Mm-hmm.

366
00:37:54,058 --> 00:37:55,726
Is he okay?

367
00:37:55,893 --> 00:37:58,062
- What do you mean?
- I mean how is he?

368
00:37:58,229 --> 00:38:02,316
Is he okay? Is he back in the barracks?
Is he a security risk? I mean, how is he?

369
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:06,988
Well, I imagine we shipped him
on off to the county hospital, don't you?

370
00:38:07,155 --> 00:38:09,073
Find out.

371
00:38:10,825 --> 00:38:14,746
And could you get me
a dozen pair of sunglasses, please?

372
00:38:14,913 --> 00:38:16,748
All right.

373
00:38:17,081 --> 00:38:23,254
You want them polarized or tinted?
You want the kind that have the mirrors?

374
00:38:23,421 --> 00:38:26,049
People can't see in,
makes them nervous as hell.

375
00:38:26,216 --> 00:38:28,885
Just the regular glasses.

376
00:38:29,511 --> 00:38:31,513
You got them.

377
00:38:35,767 --> 00:38:39,021
- Look, captain-
- Don't call me captain.

378
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:46,445
Mr. Brubaker, I know you're
probably getting ready...

379
00:38:46,612 --> 00:38:49,698
...to make some new job assignments
around here.

380
00:38:50,032 --> 00:38:53,869
You'll probably even name
your own warden's clerk.

381
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:59,333
Well, if you got a minute, I'd like to take
a shot at making a case for myself.

382
00:39:10,053 --> 00:39:13,306
Hey, I know I'm not the smartest guy
in the world...

383
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,060
...but I do know this job.

384
00:39:17,227 --> 00:39:22,441
And I know this damn place better
than any man here. And that's a fact.

385
00:39:22,983 --> 00:39:26,904
I've been the warden's clerk here
for eight years. I know it.

386
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:34,828
What you got here mainly are rural people.
You know what I mean?

387
00:39:36,664 --> 00:39:42,003
Well, they're not much at paperwork.
No sophistication. They....

388
00:39:42,586 --> 00:39:45,506
I'm not trying to put anybody down,
don't get me wrong.

389
00:39:45,673 --> 00:39:51,679
I'm just telling you the way it is.
And that is the way it is.

390
00:39:52,013 --> 00:39:54,849
What are you in for, Purcell?

391
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:58,102
- Nothing really. I-
- Nothing?

392
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:03,858
Well, I held up a card game,
if you're ready. Pretty stupid, huh?

393
00:40:04,609 --> 00:40:07,195
Undoubtedly, they were cheating you.

394
00:40:07,529 --> 00:40:09,614
Absolutely.

395
00:40:10,532 --> 00:40:12,701
That's a fact.

396
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:23,128
Anyway, you need something,
I'm your man, okay?

397
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,089
Well, just the sunglasses for now.

398
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,049
You got them.

399
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,261
- They all for you?
- None for me.

400
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,347
Gotcha.

401
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,059
What is you gonna do about my parakeet?

402
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,896
Abraham, come on, will you?
Tell your story walking.

403
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:42,315
- Take a hike.
- They let him out on purpose.

404
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:44,400
Yeah, I know, your poor bird. Jesus!

405
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,236
- Roy, Roy.
- What?

406
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,904
Do I get the desk job?

407
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:50,407
You want a desk job, huh?

408
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:54,327
Well, I got a desk job for you.
Spell "ophthalmology. "

409
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:56,580
Say what?

410
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,167
Come on, come on.

411
00:41:31,908 --> 00:41:35,286
From now on these men get out
once a day, not every six months.

412
00:41:35,453 --> 00:41:37,622
All right, sir.

413
00:41:38,414 --> 00:41:41,960
Purcell, I wanna see Bullen
at the house tonight.

414
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:44,296
Now, let's take a look at that boiler.

415
00:42:01,647 --> 00:42:03,607
You say come in?

416
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:06,694
Look, I don't like being here.

417
00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:10,239
Looks like I'm sucking up to the man,
you know what I mean?

418
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:18,456
- You're a lifer.
- Habitual criminal. The big bitch.

419
00:42:18,873 --> 00:42:21,459
You don't wanna get on my bad side.

420
00:42:21,626 --> 00:42:26,381
Word is that I'm dangerous.
How about you setting that weapon aside?

421
00:42:30,802 --> 00:42:33,305
How about you take off them glasses?

422
00:42:41,313 --> 00:42:45,400
Now, it says here that they put you
away for breaking a toilet.

423
00:42:47,152 --> 00:42:51,740
- Says you quit school in the 3rd grade.
- I ain't never quit nothing in my life.

424
00:42:52,408 --> 00:42:57,204
Born Louisiana, twin brother run over
by a train at 15.

425
00:42:57,371 --> 00:43:00,916
You were both trying to escape
the Hartsville Reformatory in Texas.

426
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:04,754
Yeah, well, they shot Hollis
and laid him on the tracks...

427
00:43:04,921 --> 00:43:08,591
...so the train would squash him up
and make it look like an accident.

428
00:43:10,551 --> 00:43:12,929
Kind of soured me, you know?

429
00:43:13,429 --> 00:43:19,227
I got away, got arrested for stealing
a '65 Pontiac sedan.

430
00:43:19,936 --> 00:43:22,939
Got two years for that, and I done them.

431
00:43:23,565 --> 00:43:28,028
I got arrested for stealing
a '69 Pontiac convertible.

432
00:43:28,445 --> 00:43:29,738
You big on Pontiacs?

433
00:43:30,072 --> 00:43:35,244
Bone white,
leather, oxblood upholstery...

434
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:37,663
...big, huge, chrome fender skirts.

435
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:39,957
How'd they compare?

436
00:43:40,124 --> 00:43:43,919
They fucked up the engine in '69,
if you ask me.

437
00:43:45,754 --> 00:43:48,799
- Anyway, I got three years for that.
- Another felony.

438
00:43:48,966 --> 00:43:51,302
Then come the toilet.

439
00:43:51,469 --> 00:43:53,763
I got picked up for vagrancy,
misdemeanor.

440
00:43:53,929 --> 00:43:56,682
The next morning,
the toilet's broke off the wall.

441
00:43:56,974 --> 00:44:01,854
There's six men in the cell. They stick me
with destruction of city property over $50.

442
00:44:02,021 --> 00:44:04,357
Felony number three.

443
00:44:04,524 --> 00:44:06,526
Habitual.

444
00:44:07,527 --> 00:44:11,281
- Judge gives you life for the toilet.
- Yeah, or give me the toilet for life.

445
00:44:12,115 --> 00:44:13,366
Same difference.

446
00:44:13,783 --> 00:44:17,370
Anyhow, here I am, shoveling shit
for dead men.

447
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:21,375
Instead, how'd you like to be a trusty...

448
00:44:21,541 --> 00:44:23,377
...and run my motor pool?

449
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:31,552
Mr. Brubaker, I been studying
you since you first come in...

450
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:36,599
...and it's come clear to me that you
are one weird fucking individual.

451
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:40,936
I ain't got you figured out yet,
whether you're a good thing or a bad one.

452
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:45,066
Does that mean you'll run my motor pool?

453
00:44:46,067 --> 00:44:48,236
Wear them khakis?

454
00:44:48,569 --> 00:44:50,279
Get me a guitar?

455
00:44:50,905 --> 00:44:53,324
Be the warden's new boy?

456
00:44:54,993 --> 00:44:56,661
No, you're smarter than that.

457
00:44:56,828 --> 00:44:59,164
The whole world's fucked up,
Mr. Brubaker.

458
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,082
Yeah.

459
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:03,835
There ain't no use.

460
00:45:13,095 --> 00:45:15,514
Tower number three.

461
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:18,392
Who am I looking at?
He's looking at me.

462
00:45:18,851 --> 00:45:20,686
Up there you got Douglas Mizell.

463
00:45:20,853 --> 00:45:26,025
- Who the hell is Doug Mizell?
- A forger. Three times grand theft.

464
00:45:28,444 --> 00:45:32,365
I want a rundown
on everybody that's got tower duty.

465
00:45:33,949 --> 00:45:37,370
I do believe that's Purcell's job, sir.

466
00:45:39,122 --> 00:45:43,376
I want only murderers up there,
one-time impulse killers.

467
00:45:44,043 --> 00:45:47,380
Well, aren't you taking kind of
a chance doing that? Aren't you?

468
00:45:47,547 --> 00:45:50,133
It's the habituals you can't trust.

469
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,302
Murderers, most of them...

470
00:45:52,886 --> 00:45:56,890
...already have it out of their systems.
Guys like you, right?

471
00:46:00,477 --> 00:46:03,313
- There's nobody around here like me.
- Oh.

472
00:46:06,483 --> 00:46:08,235
On death row, why'd you let me go?

473
00:46:08,402 --> 00:46:11,530
You tell me. You're the man.

474
00:46:16,869 --> 00:46:20,414
You're trying to cover yourself
both ways, right?

475
00:46:21,248 --> 00:46:24,669
- You're in for murder, aren't you?
- I thought that you...

476
00:46:24,835 --> 00:46:29,549
- ...asked me to come here so you could-
- All this good land, all this acreage...

477
00:46:29,715 --> 00:46:33,720
...livestock, and everybody's starving.
Except guys like you.

478
00:47:08,756 --> 00:47:11,884
- Did you eat?
- I don't eat that shit you eating.

479
00:47:12,051 --> 00:47:15,513
Oh. You know a lot about nutrition?

480
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,932
I know about hungry.

481
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:20,435
Do you like being a trusty?

482
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:24,272
Better than being a rankman.

483
00:47:24,439 --> 00:47:28,026
I suppose you're getting used
to reform wardens, seen a lot of them.

484
00:47:28,193 --> 00:47:31,446
Every warden is a reform warden.

485
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,448
Not Renfro.

486
00:47:33,615 --> 00:47:35,825
- Not Renfro?
- No.

487
00:47:35,992 --> 00:47:39,538
Where you think those clothes
came from the rankmen's wearing?

488
00:47:39,704 --> 00:47:42,416
You think we got some special factory
that makes rags?

489
00:47:42,582 --> 00:47:46,378
Renfro got those clothes brand-new,
just like the ones you'll bring in.

490
00:47:46,545 --> 00:47:48,338
- How do you know-?
- The same rags...

491
00:47:48,505 --> 00:47:51,717
- ...the next reform warden will throw out.
- Let me ask you...

492
00:47:51,884 --> 00:47:54,470
...something about being a trusty.

493
00:47:54,637 --> 00:47:57,890
When you're out in the fields,
sitting on your horse...

494
00:47:58,057 --> 00:48:02,353
...and you're holding your gun,
holding all the cards...

495
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,356
...what keeps you from taking off?

496
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:09,402
Mr. Brubaker, sir...

497
00:48:09,569 --> 00:48:13,239
...I wouldn't go around and be putting
these ideas in nobody's head.

498
00:48:13,406 --> 00:48:16,534
One day we could just lay down
all the shovels and our gun...

499
00:48:16,701 --> 00:48:20,371
...and stop playing the man's game.
Pick up and run off.

500
00:48:31,049 --> 00:48:32,718
Hello. Brubaker.

501
00:48:32,884 --> 00:48:35,929
Yeah. Hang on.

502
00:48:36,096 --> 00:48:39,766
Coombes. Coombes?

503
00:48:39,933 --> 00:48:42,770
- Yeah?
- For you.

504
00:48:47,399 --> 00:48:49,109
Yeah?

505
00:48:49,276 --> 00:48:51,070
What?

506
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:53,239
How many hurt?

507
00:48:53,406 --> 00:48:55,741
What about security?

508
00:48:55,908 --> 00:48:57,743
Okay, I'll be right there.

509
00:48:57,910 --> 00:48:59,787
- What's-?
- Are we finished with-?

510
00:48:59,954 --> 00:49:03,499
- Yeah. What's wrong?
- The rank barrack's roof just caved in.

511
00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:32,362
Hey, you boys get back
to your bunks over there!

512
00:49:42,373 --> 00:49:45,376
You're taking a chance going in there,
you know that?

513
00:49:52,091 --> 00:49:55,219
Somebody kill the current
in this building.

514
00:49:55,595 --> 00:49:57,472
Help!

515
00:49:57,639 --> 00:49:59,015
Get off of me!

516
00:49:59,724 --> 00:50:01,017
Give me a hand.

517
00:50:01,184 --> 00:50:03,186
Give me a hand, Coombes!

518
00:50:19,328 --> 00:50:22,748
Holy Christ!
How do we get through that?

519
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:29,755
Get these men out of here, now!

520
00:50:29,922 --> 00:50:32,758
What are you gonna do with them?
Put them in your house?

521
00:50:39,265 --> 00:50:43,770
What do you mean, call the state hospital?
You're 20 miles closer.

522
00:50:45,313 --> 00:50:48,191
It's raining like hell outside.

523
00:50:48,858 --> 00:50:52,779
I've got one station wagon.
I can't put them in open trucks.

524
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:55,782
What?

525
00:50:57,075 --> 00:50:59,286
Listen to me. These are injured men.

526
00:50:59,452 --> 00:51:01,496
No, don't lay down.
Hey, don't lay down.

527
00:51:01,663 --> 00:51:04,583
Put this here. Give me your hand.
Put some pressure on it.

528
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,543
An hour?!

529
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:08,045
Why?

530
00:51:08,212 --> 00:51:10,130
Why?

531
00:51:16,178 --> 00:51:19,223
All right, now, I'm counting on that.
Two ambulances.

532
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:22,226
Yeah, thanks a lot.

533
00:51:26,772 --> 00:51:29,066
We got a bleeder over here!

534
00:51:33,071 --> 00:51:35,740
You gotta get this man to a hospital!

535
00:51:36,157 --> 00:51:39,536
- They all gotta be.
- I said I can't afford no more.

536
00:51:39,702 --> 00:51:41,579
Shut up!

537
00:51:41,746 --> 00:51:43,248
What did he say?

538
00:51:43,415 --> 00:51:45,083
Nothing.

539
00:51:45,917 --> 00:51:47,919
Brubaker, I can't afford no more.

540
00:51:48,086 --> 00:51:50,255
- Shut up!
- Wait a minute.

541
00:51:50,422 --> 00:51:51,840
What's going on here?

542
00:51:52,007 --> 00:51:54,259
I said, nothing.

543
00:51:54,593 --> 00:51:57,930
- What's the matter with you?
- You charge for medical attention?

544
00:51:58,096 --> 00:51:59,515
- Who?
- You!

545
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:03,060
What are you so excited about?
We been doing it this way for years.

546
00:52:05,437 --> 00:52:07,940
Get your hands off me! Don't!

547
00:52:08,107 --> 00:52:10,276
You call yourself a doctor?

548
00:52:10,943 --> 00:52:12,945
Get your ass off this farm!

549
00:52:13,112 --> 00:52:14,989
Crazy man! You're a crazy man!

550
00:52:15,156 --> 00:52:17,575
Crazy fool!

551
00:52:36,928 --> 00:52:39,806
Zaranska, this is your hospital now.

552
00:52:39,973 --> 00:52:41,808
- What? Hell, I-
- You're in charge...

553
00:52:41,975 --> 00:52:43,643
...until we get a real doctor.

554
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:45,270
I don't know about hospital-

555
00:52:45,437 --> 00:52:47,814
You know a lot more about it than I do.

556
00:52:47,981 --> 00:52:50,108
Work with me.

557
00:53:21,141 --> 00:53:23,101
Looking good, warden.

558
00:53:24,019 --> 00:53:25,603
Willets.

559
00:53:28,648 --> 00:53:32,194
We just took delivery on 300 cases
of chili con carne last week.

560
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,987
Where are they now? I wonder.

561
00:53:34,154 --> 00:53:36,031
No, I just looked in the locker.

562
00:53:36,198 --> 00:53:38,075
Boys gobble it up?

563
00:53:39,451 --> 00:53:41,078
Not the rankmen.

564
00:53:41,245 --> 00:53:43,414
And there's only 50 trusties.

565
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:47,668
Now, that comes to 7200 cans.

566
00:53:47,835 --> 00:53:51,714
Divided by 50 trusties,
that comes to 144 cans.

567
00:53:51,881 --> 00:53:54,050
And you correct me if I'm wrong.
You okay?

568
00:53:54,216 --> 00:53:55,968
You're going too fast for me.

569
00:53:56,469 --> 00:53:59,555
Divided by seven days...

570
00:53:59,722 --> 00:54:05,812
...that comes to 20.5 cans of chili
per trusty per day.

571
00:54:05,979 --> 00:54:08,022
Now, does that tell you anything?

572
00:54:08,189 --> 00:54:09,691
Willets?

573
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,736
- Are you alive, Willets?
- No, sir.

574
00:54:12,902 --> 00:54:14,362
Great.

575
00:54:14,654 --> 00:54:17,949
Excuse me. The roof just fell in.
People are starving to death.

576
00:54:18,116 --> 00:54:21,077
I'd like you to find out
where all the food is going here.

577
00:54:21,244 --> 00:54:24,456
Purcell, I want this-
You'll do that, Willets?

578
00:54:24,623 --> 00:54:27,167
I want this posted:
Only regulation outfits now...

579
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:29,711
...are prison-issue pants,
boots and shirts.

580
00:54:30,254 --> 00:54:33,215
- We don't have any boots.
- Well, order them.

581
00:54:33,382 --> 00:54:37,636
- But that's Willets' area, acquisitions.
- Roy, no, you order them, would you?

582
00:54:37,803 --> 00:54:41,015
And I'm gonna need about 700 pairs.
And no more shaved heads.

583
00:54:41,182 --> 00:54:44,143
Yeah, but sizes. How am I gonna
figure out how many nines?

584
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:46,312
You know that. Come on.

585
00:54:47,897 --> 00:54:50,358
Goddamn, look at you.

586
00:54:50,525 --> 00:54:53,069
New blood.
Now, that's what this place needing.

587
00:54:53,277 --> 00:54:55,613
You're Brubaker, am I right?

588
00:54:56,614 --> 00:55:00,118
- That's right.
- Don't look like no warden.

589
00:55:01,536 --> 00:55:04,456
Chocolate prune cake in there.

590
00:55:04,622 --> 00:55:07,042
My missis baked it up special
for you.

591
00:55:08,585 --> 00:55:11,755
I hate prunes. They cloud my mind.

592
00:55:12,547 --> 00:55:15,634
- I say my name?
- No, but I know who you are.

593
00:55:15,801 --> 00:55:18,971
C.P. Woodward. Call me Woody.
Now, you saying we met?

594
00:55:19,137 --> 00:55:22,391
- What can I do for you, Mr. Woodward?
- Roof.

595
00:55:22,558 --> 00:55:25,853
- What?
- Roof. I came about the roof.

596
00:55:27,396 --> 00:55:31,692
Purcell gave me a yell, said you declared
a state of emergency or something.

597
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:37,823
I thought you just sell lumber.

598
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:40,993
Oh, I sell it, I grow it,
I mill it, I hammer it.

599
00:55:41,244 --> 00:55:43,579
I got wood in my veins.

600
00:55:44,205 --> 00:55:47,625
You just give me
your John Hancock there.

601
00:55:47,792 --> 00:55:49,335
We'll fix things up tight.

602
00:55:49,502 --> 00:55:50,712
No. No, hold it now.

603
00:55:50,879 --> 00:55:54,382
Don't you wanna go up there
and see what the size of the problem is?

604
00:55:54,549 --> 00:55:56,551
Whatever we find, we'll fix.

605
00:55:56,718 --> 00:55:58,637
See, the damn thing of it is...

606
00:55:58,803 --> 00:56:02,849
...you get one little pinprick hole
in that tar paper from the factory-

607
00:56:03,016 --> 00:56:06,937
This isn't a question of pinpricks
or tar paper. You built that thing wrong.

608
00:56:07,104 --> 00:56:09,273
You know it.
You built it two years ago...

609
00:56:09,439 --> 00:56:11,608
...and I want you to rebuild it.

610
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:13,694
Of course you do.
And don't you worry.

611
00:56:13,861 --> 00:56:18,449
I can help you out on the cost. I'll bill
only my materials full this time around.

612
00:56:18,616 --> 00:56:20,993
This isn't gonna cost me anything.

613
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:24,288
- You guarantee your work, don't you?
- Of course!

614
00:56:24,455 --> 00:56:28,918
Look, you gotta get on top
of this shit pile, Henry...

615
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:31,546
...and then the job's
not just a ball-buster.

616
00:56:31,712 --> 00:56:33,923
I mean, you'll be happier then.

617
00:56:35,591 --> 00:56:37,802
Well, I'm not complaining.

618
00:56:38,469 --> 00:56:41,264
Are you unhappy?
It sure sounds like it to me.

619
00:56:51,066 --> 00:56:53,568
I'm not in
the construction business for my health.

620
00:56:53,735 --> 00:56:55,612
Or anybody else's, it seems.

621
00:56:56,113 --> 00:57:00,325
I am in the middle of my inventory. It's
a pain in the ass, but I rushed over here.

622
00:57:00,534 --> 00:57:03,871
Ain't been anybody coming
from Wakefield to give me a hand lately.

623
00:57:04,038 --> 00:57:07,291
We're not sending any convicts
to you anymore, Mr. Woodward.

624
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:11,295
- That's slave labor.
- No. It is not.

625
00:57:11,462 --> 00:57:13,839
No, no. You got it all backwards.

626
00:57:14,006 --> 00:57:16,759
See, because this is a community.

627
00:57:16,926 --> 00:57:21,764
The people around here don't ostracize
this prison. We accept it.

628
00:57:21,931 --> 00:57:23,474
We cooperate.

629
00:57:23,641 --> 00:57:26,352
It's a two-way street.

630
00:57:26,519 --> 00:57:30,523
Now, you gonna be seeing
a lot of nice things...

631
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:33,401
...from people
in the farm-supply business...

632
00:57:33,568 --> 00:57:36,237
- ...clothing business-
- Lumber business?

633
00:57:37,614 --> 00:57:41,910
Take that cake. Now, the point
ain't whether you like prune.

634
00:57:43,245 --> 00:57:45,998
- It's the thought that counts.
- Exactly.

635
00:57:46,164 --> 00:57:50,043
It's only smart to accept the stuff,
keep your mouth shut...

636
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:53,088
...and let things run like they've been
going for 100 years.

637
00:57:53,255 --> 00:57:56,008
Before we was born even, you and me.

638
00:57:56,634 --> 00:57:59,261
I'm talking about tradition.

639
00:57:59,428 --> 00:58:01,597
Don't fuck with tradition.

640
00:58:02,097 --> 00:58:04,892
Count your own woodpile, Woody.

641
00:58:05,059 --> 00:58:07,228
I'll fix my own roof.

642
00:58:08,062 --> 00:58:12,191
- People are gonna be disappointed in you.
- It won't be the first time.

643
00:58:13,192 --> 00:58:15,319
And I hope you're right. Take this.

644
00:58:15,486 --> 00:58:17,030
Take it.

645
00:58:17,655 --> 00:58:21,201
Purcell, get me all the contracts
and insurance policies on that roof.

646
00:58:21,367 --> 00:58:23,203
I want everything you got.

647
00:58:23,453 --> 00:58:26,122
Whose team are you on, Purcell?

648
00:58:26,331 --> 00:58:29,751
What can I say?
He's the coach for now.

649
00:58:29,918 --> 00:58:32,003
Short season.

650
00:58:39,052 --> 00:58:41,388
Oh, no. It's no secret.

651
00:58:41,555 --> 00:58:43,849
Write it all down.

652
00:58:44,058 --> 00:58:47,686
We got prison lumber, prison labor
building motels for people in town...

653
00:58:47,853 --> 00:58:50,856
...building people's swimming pools.
That's right.

654
00:58:51,273 --> 00:58:55,778
And my kitchen-rider, my trusty,
is loading our food into state police cars.

655
00:58:55,945 --> 00:58:58,906
State police? It runs that deep?

656
00:58:59,073 --> 00:59:02,118
We're gonna be stepping
on more toes than I imagined.

657
00:59:03,035 --> 00:59:04,620
What's that?

658
00:59:08,791 --> 00:59:12,629
I'm just warning you, because
you're likely to start hearing some things.

659
00:59:12,796 --> 00:59:16,633
All right, I'll be ready
to run some interference for you.

660
00:59:17,133 --> 00:59:20,303
No, no. I'll talk to the governor.
Let me do that.

661
00:59:20,887 --> 00:59:23,140
Lilly, can I call you back?

662
00:59:23,432 --> 00:59:25,017
Uh-huh.

663
00:59:25,225 --> 00:59:26,768
Bye.

664
00:59:36,403 --> 00:59:38,155
There you go.

665
00:59:38,322 --> 00:59:40,366
There you go.

666
00:59:40,533 --> 00:59:41,951
There you go.

667
00:59:42,118 --> 00:59:45,204
Put some down on there.
Give me some of that stuff there.

668
00:59:45,371 --> 00:59:47,748
Hey, wait a minute, man.
There you go.

669
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:44,766
Where's Huey Rauch?

670
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,101
I haven't seen him around.

671
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:18,759
Smell this.

672
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:26,350
- I'm a city boy.
- Purcell?

673
01:01:34,192 --> 01:01:36,527
That smells like kerosene.

674
01:02:16,819 --> 01:02:19,822
This animal's been shot.
Do you know anything about it?

675
01:02:22,658 --> 01:02:26,120
That truck out there, you don't know
anything about that either, I suppose.

676
01:02:26,287 --> 01:02:28,456
Looked like a free-worlder.

677
01:02:51,146 --> 01:02:53,023
Now, what are these?

678
01:02:53,273 --> 01:02:54,942
I don't know.

679
01:02:58,404 --> 01:02:59,780
Shacks.

680
01:03:00,656 --> 01:03:02,700
Are they on our property?

681
01:03:03,242 --> 01:03:05,161
Let me think.

682
01:03:07,204 --> 01:03:09,290
Honestly...

683
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:12,835
...yeah, I think.

684
01:03:13,503 --> 01:03:15,004
Oh, shit.

685
01:03:21,135 --> 01:03:23,972
I don't know who's in there,
I don't know what you're up to.

686
01:03:24,139 --> 01:03:28,268
But we got the new warden from the
prison here, and we're probably coming in.

687
01:03:28,435 --> 01:03:29,853
Right?

688
01:03:35,275 --> 01:03:37,152
Probably nobody home.

689
01:03:37,319 --> 01:03:41,949
Fuck you, Huey. I ain't hiding
in the dark like no human insect.

690
01:03:47,287 --> 01:03:49,373
Yeah? What?

691
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:51,834
- Good morning.
- Morning.

692
01:03:52,293 --> 01:03:55,421
Would you please get your ass out here
and take care of this?

693
01:03:56,464 --> 01:03:58,716
Excuse me. I have a tight schedule.

694
01:03:58,883 --> 01:04:02,470
- With one thing on his mind.
- Don't make it sound like that.

695
01:04:02,637 --> 01:04:05,848
Everything has to be learned.
Even kids have had sex.

696
01:04:06,015 --> 01:04:09,519
Is that what you're going
to practice at your next party?

697
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:12,939
- How many out there?
- I don't know. Three, four.

698
01:04:14,149 --> 01:04:16,401
I don't want you
to get a reputation for-

699
01:04:16,568 --> 01:04:17,652
Pull that up.

700
01:04:17,819 --> 01:04:20,405
I already have one, the wrong kind.

701
01:04:23,325 --> 01:04:26,787
And at the proper time,
to marry a man who respects you.

702
01:04:26,953 --> 01:04:31,667
- I want you to have a good name. I want-
- You want! You want!

703
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:33,627
Is that all you can say?

704
01:04:34,169 --> 01:04:35,337
Uh....

705
01:04:36,088 --> 01:04:38,841
You want-?
You want a beer or something?

706
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:42,511
Don't you ever let me
hear you say anything like that again.

707
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:51,395
Popeil's improved
Veg-O-Matic stretches food dollars.

708
01:04:51,771 --> 01:04:56,275
Millions bought at 7. 77.
Now it's yours for only 5. 77.

709
01:04:56,442 --> 01:04:58,069
You save two dollars!

710
01:04:58,236 --> 01:05:00,405
Where's your wallet at?

711
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:07,704
That's my personal property.

712
01:05:08,246 --> 01:05:10,123
I'm going.

713
01:05:10,999 --> 01:05:13,210
Save two dollars
from the former price.

714
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:16,088
Get one today for only 5. 77.

715
01:05:22,261 --> 01:05:24,638
- Let me give you-
- I got it. I got it.

716
01:05:33,272 --> 01:05:35,816
Hot dog, look what we got here.

717
01:05:36,275 --> 01:05:39,779
That'd be Warden Renfro's
monthly supply, I imagine.

718
01:05:39,946 --> 01:05:42,490
Man took baths in that stuff.

719
01:05:49,539 --> 01:05:50,790
Hey, Willets?

720
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:53,960
Try and stay with me on this one,
will you?

721
01:05:54,127 --> 01:05:59,049
Now, the rankmen have been working
sunrise to sunset, growing produce...

722
01:05:59,215 --> 01:06:02,385
...so the warden and trusties
could sell it below market value...

723
01:06:02,552 --> 01:06:03,804
...to some local cannery...

724
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:07,349
...where the proceeds could
go to buying more chili and soda...

725
01:06:07,641 --> 01:06:10,811
...which in turn could be resold
to some supermarket chain...

726
01:06:10,978 --> 01:06:13,188
...at an even greater profit.

727
01:06:13,355 --> 01:06:15,649
- You think so?
- Do I think so?

728
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:19,236
What did you do with this chili?
You've been signing it out.

729
01:06:19,403 --> 01:06:23,032
- How about that?
- I signed what Capt. Renfro told me to.

730
01:06:24,825 --> 01:06:27,870
You can sign your own severance check,
because you're fired.

731
01:06:28,037 --> 01:06:30,790
- I'm civil service.
- Fired.

732
01:06:56,441 --> 01:06:57,776
Hey, this is chaos.

733
01:06:57,943 --> 01:07:00,571
How can we handle purchasing
without Willets?

734
01:07:00,737 --> 01:07:02,447
They're gonna do it.

735
01:07:02,823 --> 01:07:05,451
- Who?
- They're gonna have an election.

736
01:07:05,951 --> 01:07:08,120
Pick an inmate council.

737
01:07:09,413 --> 01:07:10,915
That's a hell of an idea.

738
01:07:11,123 --> 01:07:14,543
- What?
- I said, that's a hell of an idea!

739
01:07:22,552 --> 01:07:24,429
Put it down over there.

740
01:07:25,054 --> 01:07:27,223
Huey! Glad to see you back.

741
01:07:28,057 --> 01:07:32,187
- Something funny about that, is there?
- I can't wait till you bring Carol here.

742
01:07:32,353 --> 01:07:34,773
We all get dibs on that.

743
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,819
That's funny as hell.

744
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:43,281
Floyd.

745
01:07:43,448 --> 01:07:46,743
Brubaker be turning this place
into a damn jailhouse.

746
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:50,330
Yeah. Well, he just doesn't know
who's running the place.

747
01:07:50,497 --> 01:07:53,000
- Deach will set him straight on that.
- I hope so.

748
01:07:53,167 --> 01:07:55,085
- Floyd?
- Yeah?

749
01:07:55,252 --> 01:07:56,545
Get out of here.

750
01:07:56,712 --> 01:07:58,922
- What?
- Get out of here.

751
01:07:59,089 --> 01:08:01,175
I live here, Huey.

752
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:06,013
Get your stuff and get out of here, Floyd.
I gotta move in here. This is mine now.

753
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:07,807
All right.

754
01:08:08,516 --> 01:08:12,812
Get my bird and come back
for the rest of my stuff.

755
01:08:13,646 --> 01:08:14,689
Let's go.

756
01:08:22,155 --> 01:08:24,282
Spivey, you take that shack
over there.

757
01:08:24,449 --> 01:08:26,284
Bullen, take that one.

758
01:08:45,179 --> 01:08:48,682
It'd be a lot smarter
to do this during the daylight hours.

759
01:08:48,849 --> 01:08:51,185
Not so many people
would see the flames.

760
01:08:51,352 --> 01:08:55,481
Maybe that's just exactly why he's doing
it now, you ever think of that?

761
01:09:16,044 --> 01:09:17,921
He's crazy.

762
01:09:18,088 --> 01:09:19,422
No, he's not.

763
01:09:20,507 --> 01:09:24,594
- He's dangerous.
- Somebody needs to stop him.

764
01:09:25,178 --> 01:09:26,638
Put a bullet in him.

765
01:09:36,190 --> 01:09:38,734
There's a disease growing
in there, Henry.

766
01:09:38,901 --> 01:09:41,028
Hostile to your health.

767
01:09:41,737 --> 01:09:42,988
I know that.

768
01:09:43,155 --> 01:09:47,368
You ought to get yourself some
paper cups or plates or something.

769
01:09:54,208 --> 01:09:58,129
You ought to get yourself someone
to look after you around here.

770
01:09:59,005 --> 01:10:02,258
That doesn't sound like the kind of advice
I'd expect from you.

771
01:10:04,427 --> 01:10:05,470
No, I meant....

772
01:10:05,637 --> 01:10:08,098
I meant one of those convicts.

773
01:10:09,099 --> 01:10:11,226
So how's it going?

774
01:10:15,063 --> 01:10:17,482
If the Chinese invade us...

775
01:10:17,774 --> 01:10:19,610
...I got insurance.

776
01:10:20,027 --> 01:10:24,573
If we have a landslide, earthquake,
a volcano erupts, I'm covered.

777
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:28,577
If a roof caves in, nothing.
No insurance.

778
01:10:29,703 --> 01:10:32,790
- What are you gonna do?
- We're gonna rebuild it ourselves.

779
01:10:32,957 --> 01:10:35,084
- Terrific!
- Terrific?

780
01:10:35,251 --> 01:10:39,505
Yes. The governor's been wanting to come
down here for a while. It's a perfect time.

781
01:10:39,672 --> 01:10:41,841
He'll actually see
something happening.

782
01:10:42,174 --> 01:10:46,304
Have a few pictures taken, shake a few
hands, put his arm around an inmate.

783
01:10:46,471 --> 01:10:48,556
It's what you call
a photo opportunity.

784
01:10:48,723 --> 01:10:51,017
That was uncalled for.
Tom's not like that and you know it.

785
01:10:51,184 --> 01:10:53,728
- I don't know Tom.
- He hired you, didn't he?

786
01:10:53,895 --> 01:10:56,022
But I need a doctor here,
not a governor.

787
01:10:56,189 --> 01:10:57,232
You need both.

788
01:10:57,399 --> 01:11:00,944
- I know what I need here.
- No, I know what you need here.

789
01:11:01,152 --> 01:11:04,447
It's a very complex world
out there, Henry.

790
01:11:04,865 --> 01:11:09,745
I'm dealing with a lot of people who would
rather not see that prison change at all.

791
01:11:10,829 --> 01:11:14,625
And they're sure letting me know about it.
I've been hit from all sides.

792
01:11:14,792 --> 01:11:17,503
I got people out there trying
to shoot my cattle.

793
01:11:17,669 --> 01:11:22,049
Got trusties inside here sabotaging
my crops and there's not a thing I can do.

794
01:11:22,216 --> 01:11:23,676
Why not?

795
01:11:25,344 --> 01:11:29,348
Do you know what happens if I rank
a man, if I send a trusty into the barracks?

796
01:11:29,515 --> 01:11:32,727
- What?
- He's dead. Other men will kill him.

797
01:11:32,894 --> 01:11:35,313
Can't you work with them?
Change their attitude?

798
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,023
I'm trying.

799
01:11:37,857 --> 01:11:39,025
But I gotta deliver.

800
01:11:39,192 --> 01:11:42,111
I can't come in here
and just paint this place.

801
01:11:42,737 --> 01:11:44,280
Lillian...

802
01:11:44,781 --> 01:11:46,032
...a permanent doctor.

803
01:11:46,366 --> 01:11:49,744
Yeah, yeah. I know.
I am getting you one. I am.

804
01:11:50,036 --> 01:11:53,123
Look, there's a prison board meeting
on Tuesday night.

805
01:11:53,582 --> 01:11:55,542
I want you there.

806
01:11:55,959 --> 01:11:58,045
The great diplomat.

807
01:11:59,004 --> 01:12:00,213
I'll take that risk.

808
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:02,758
They're bringing
in some deputy warden...

809
01:12:02,925 --> 01:12:06,095
...who's gonna give us a nice little talk
on prison reform.

810
01:12:07,971 --> 01:12:10,808
I see, and you want me there
to defend myself.

811
01:12:10,975 --> 01:12:13,727
No, I want a second opinion
in that room, Henry.

812
01:12:13,894 --> 01:12:15,187
State your case!

813
01:12:15,354 --> 01:12:19,191
They need to meet you.
I mean, you do make an impression, right?

814
01:12:37,836 --> 01:12:39,337
All right!

815
01:13:47,074 --> 01:13:50,411
Damn, this is like sitting
on top of the world, ain't it?

816
01:13:56,792 --> 01:13:59,337
God almighty.

817
01:14:02,256 --> 01:14:04,550
Hey, you know what I'd like
to do with her?

818
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:08,554
Yeah, I know what you'd like to do.

819
01:14:09,639 --> 01:14:11,599
Well, you're wrong.

820
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:14,853
Do you ever just want to talk?

821
01:14:15,228 --> 01:14:18,732
Shit. You've been whacking
it so long, Bullen...

822
01:14:18,898 --> 01:14:22,193
...your mind's starting
to collapse in on itself.

823
01:14:35,499 --> 01:14:36,708
- Brubaker.
- Yeah?

824
01:14:36,875 --> 01:14:40,879
You know something? That's the first
I've heard those guys laugh in 15 years.

825
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:43,215
It doesn't bother you, does it?

826
01:14:51,557 --> 01:14:54,060
Oh, man, I tell you,
we gotta hang in together.

827
01:14:54,227 --> 01:14:57,730
We gotta put men on that council that
got their heads screwed on...

828
01:14:57,897 --> 01:15:02,610
...because Brubaker will use the council
to take away your power completely!

829
01:15:02,777 --> 01:15:05,613
He already took away
my refrigerator and my locker.

830
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:07,699
I hear he's putting
a new lock on the gate.

831
01:15:07,866 --> 01:15:09,534
There. You see?

832
01:15:13,079 --> 01:15:16,625
My name is Jerome L. Boyd.

833
01:15:16,792 --> 01:15:19,961
And I got what is called
a sociopathic personality.

834
01:15:20,754 --> 01:15:22,548
A sociopathic personality.

835
01:15:22,714 --> 01:15:25,425
That means I ain't got no feeling
for my fellow man...

836
01:15:25,592 --> 01:15:28,345
...because of how my parents
fucked me up.

837
01:15:28,554 --> 01:15:30,681
Now hold on a minute now. Listen.

838
01:15:30,848 --> 01:15:33,517
- I deem it an honor...
- How much you gonna pay us?

839
01:15:33,684 --> 01:15:38,522
...to throw aside all my hatred for all you
dumb assholes and try and help you.

840
01:15:45,822 --> 01:15:48,157
Let there be a hush on the land.

841
01:15:48,324 --> 01:15:52,203
Gentlemen, Jesus come over down
to my bunk here, Tuesday a week.

842
01:15:52,370 --> 01:15:55,623
And he hovered up there, kind of hovered.
You know what he said?

843
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:57,083
- What'd he say?
- Say what?

844
01:15:57,250 --> 01:16:00,337
- What'd he say?
- Oh, well, he said:

845
01:16:00,503 --> 01:16:04,466
"Frank, many is called,
but damn few is chosen.

846
01:16:05,383 --> 01:16:07,302
I'm gonna put you on my first team.

847
01:16:07,469 --> 01:16:11,306
And I want you to put these
boys underneath your wing...

848
01:16:11,473 --> 01:16:14,017
...and see to it that they get
any subscriptions...

849
01:16:14,184 --> 01:16:17,354
...to any damn magazines they want
in their barracks! "

850
01:16:17,521 --> 01:16:19,189
All right!

851
01:16:26,697 --> 01:16:28,699
Now, I am corrupt.

852
01:16:28,866 --> 01:16:31,994
That's right.
Just like the rest of you.

853
01:16:32,161 --> 01:16:36,040
But I am honest about it.

854
01:16:36,499 --> 01:16:40,336
Now, you vote for Mr. Clarence...

855
01:16:40,503 --> 01:16:43,673
...know exactly what you get.

856
01:16:56,978 --> 01:16:58,021
- Zaranska?
- Yes?

857
01:16:58,188 --> 01:17:01,191
- One vote, now. One vote.
- One vote. One vote.

858
01:17:01,358 --> 01:17:04,027
Don't be such an old woman, Duane.
One vote, one vote.

859
01:17:04,194 --> 01:17:05,946
Oh, feel the power!

860
01:17:06,113 --> 01:17:10,451
- Feel mysterious wonders working within.
- Hallelujah! Can I get witness?

861
01:17:10,617 --> 01:17:13,787
The Lord-
I believe the Lord is with us!

862
01:17:14,288 --> 01:17:15,331
Name?

863
01:17:23,589 --> 01:17:27,427
- What about the doctor?
- Be here this afternoon.

864
01:17:27,844 --> 01:17:30,346
They said he was gonna be here
three days ago.

865
01:17:30,513 --> 01:17:32,974
- Said he's coming about 1.
- Would you double-check that?

866
01:17:33,141 --> 01:17:35,226
Yeah. One more.

867
01:17:48,198 --> 01:17:50,200
What are you waiting for?

868
01:17:51,243 --> 01:17:52,536
We're waiting on you.

869
01:17:53,036 --> 01:17:56,540
You are the inmate council.
You know how it works. Go on ahead.

870
01:17:56,915 --> 01:17:58,417
I'll be with you in a minute.

871
01:18:10,471 --> 01:18:14,100
Now, wait a minute.
Because that's not the way I understood it.

872
01:18:14,267 --> 01:18:16,310
Lillian Gray got authorization...

873
01:18:16,477 --> 01:18:20,106
...for you people to go out and get bids
on that new boiler right away.

874
01:18:23,651 --> 01:18:25,904
Well, how long does his lunch take?

875
01:18:26,404 --> 01:18:29,240
Well, when will he be back
from his haircut?

876
01:18:31,242 --> 01:18:34,538
Yes. Would you, please?

877
01:18:34,704 --> 01:18:37,207
Definitely. Yes, today.

878
01:18:37,374 --> 01:18:38,917
Thanks.

879
01:18:57,061 --> 01:18:58,437
Something wrong?

880
01:18:58,687 --> 01:19:00,064
Um....

881
01:19:00,481 --> 01:19:03,401
Don't know exactly where to start here,
Mr. Brubaker.

882
01:19:03,568 --> 01:19:06,279
One man, one vote. It's up to you.

883
01:19:06,821 --> 01:19:09,032
You drop the hammer
on what you don't like.

884
01:19:09,198 --> 01:19:10,533
No.

885
01:19:14,412 --> 01:19:15,997
All right, then...

886
01:19:16,164 --> 01:19:19,793
...I make a motion
that we consider a movement...

887
01:19:19,959 --> 01:19:23,838
...to discuss the shitty plumbing
in the barracks. How many say aye?

888
01:19:26,842 --> 01:19:28,677
- Aye.
- Thanks.

889
01:19:28,844 --> 01:19:32,598
Uh, somebody should be taking notes
about this.

890
01:19:32,973 --> 01:19:35,851
How about Pavitch?
There's a rumor he can write.

891
01:19:37,019 --> 01:19:39,772
Yeah, Pavitch. Take a note.

892
01:19:40,522 --> 01:19:44,109
This coffee tastes like Zaranska
washed his feet in it.

893
01:19:44,693 --> 01:19:48,447
Only you'd know about that special
flavor, Larry Lee, you old sock-sucker.

894
01:19:48,614 --> 01:19:51,033
Sir, this is looking like
a damn waste of time.

895
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,953
All right, Caldwell,
then why don't you resign?

896
01:19:55,872 --> 01:19:58,207
We can find a replacement
for you fast.

897
01:20:08,259 --> 01:20:09,761
Yeah.

898
01:20:19,563 --> 01:20:23,901
The living facilities are
important. Toilets and beds and such-like.

899
01:20:24,067 --> 01:20:27,112
I think we ought to start there.
It's a good place to start.

900
01:20:27,613 --> 01:20:32,910
Can we get a contractor in
or somebody to redo the toilets?

901
01:20:40,835 --> 01:20:44,463
Mr. Spivey, can I see the warden?

902
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:48,342
Well, the council's in session and
these men got appointments afterwards.

903
01:20:48,509 --> 01:20:51,512
Probably not gonna get in
on account of Mr. Brubaker's...

904
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:54,933
...got a prison board meeting
tonight he maybe got to be at.

905
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:58,478
But I want to see him.

906
01:20:58,645 --> 01:21:02,023
Birdwell, if a trusty escapes
off of minimum security...

907
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:04,317
- ...then he can't be a trusty.
Damn straight.

908
01:21:04,484 --> 01:21:06,570
If you can't trust a trusty,
who can you trust?

909
01:21:06,736 --> 01:21:09,906
Well, sure. But I'm talking
about extenuating circumstances.

910
01:21:10,073 --> 01:21:11,491
For instance, a man escapes.

911
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:15,871
Then realizing the error of his ways,
gives himself up voluntarily.

912
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:19,041
- That's horseshit.
- So put him in the hole for 10 days.

913
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:22,461
I agree. And take away
all his visiting privileges for a month.

914
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:25,005
What are you talking about,
visiting privileges?

915
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:27,091
Don't let him mail
more than a letter a week.

916
01:21:27,258 --> 01:21:28,300
I like it.

917
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:32,888
And send him up to his room and don't let
him watch no TV for a whole damn week.

918
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:36,225
I don't know where you
get your ideas of criminal justice.

919
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:38,728
Up your ass, I believe.

920
01:21:40,605 --> 01:21:43,024
Wanna know something, Zaranska?

921
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:46,694
- Sure, Birdy, I'd love to know something.
- About your mama?

922
01:21:49,489 --> 01:21:52,158
Hey, hey, hey, come on!

923
01:21:52,909 --> 01:21:54,369
Come on, Abraham. Let's go.

924
01:21:54,536 --> 01:21:57,622
You get your goddamn hands
off him, Purcell!

925
01:21:58,081 --> 01:22:00,459
I got to clean my conscience.

926
01:22:00,834 --> 01:22:03,712
I got something I've got
to tell you about in private.

927
01:22:03,879 --> 01:22:07,883
Listen, Abraham, you don't have
to go explain anything to anybody.

928
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:10,344
Why don't you come into my office?
Come on.

929
01:22:10,511 --> 01:22:13,013
I got guys waiting outside
that have appointments.

930
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:17,017
Well, tell them a story, Roy.
You guys can manage.

931
01:22:19,437 --> 01:22:21,188
You're right.

932
01:22:21,355 --> 01:22:25,735
I come to Wakefield
before World War ll.

933
01:22:25,985 --> 01:22:27,361
Take a walk, Purcell.

934
01:22:28,946 --> 01:22:31,199
This ain't open to the public.

935
01:22:34,369 --> 01:22:35,745
Yeah.

936
01:22:37,247 --> 01:22:39,708
We used to make corn liquor
out of this.

937
01:22:39,874 --> 01:22:42,210
Growed it at the Camp Five field.

938
01:22:48,717 --> 01:22:50,385
What happened...?

939
01:22:51,887 --> 01:22:53,764
What happened to your eye?

940
01:22:53,931 --> 01:22:55,098
Oh, got hit.

941
01:22:55,265 --> 01:22:56,809
With what?

942
01:22:57,392 --> 01:23:01,730
With a baseball bat, a trace chain...

943
01:23:01,897 --> 01:23:04,900
...and a rope with knots in it.

944
01:23:20,708 --> 01:23:23,127
You're doing time for manslaughter?

945
01:23:23,586 --> 01:23:28,049
Yes, sir.
I killed my baby brother with a rock.

946
01:23:28,591 --> 01:23:30,468
How much time?

947
01:23:33,179 --> 01:23:35,181
How much time?

948
01:23:36,266 --> 01:23:38,518
Thirty-five year.

949
01:23:38,685 --> 01:23:41,605
How long have you been in here,
Mr. Cooke?

950
01:23:43,523 --> 01:23:45,943
- Hell, I don't know.
- Well, I do.

951
01:23:46,109 --> 01:23:51,240
Thirty-eight years, six months,
according to this.

952
01:23:59,206 --> 01:24:00,708
Yeah.

953
01:24:00,875 --> 01:24:03,586
New doctor's here.
He's out here waiting to say hello.

954
01:24:03,753 --> 01:24:05,963
Great. Tell him just a minute,
would you?

955
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:08,341
There were lots of other guys.

956
01:24:08,591 --> 01:24:12,971
The yard man say, "Abraham,
chop them up in tiny little pieces...

957
01:24:13,137 --> 01:24:16,850
...and take them for a walk down
in them shadows. "

958
01:24:17,142 --> 01:24:18,184
What?

959
01:24:18,351 --> 01:24:21,312
I gave Jake's clothes to the laundry.

960
01:24:21,479 --> 01:24:25,609
Come Christmas Day,
I stuck him in close...

961
01:24:25,775 --> 01:24:30,238
...at the fence, where all them other
boys are dead and buried at now.

962
01:24:31,073 --> 01:24:34,076
Must be over 200
of them out there now.

963
01:24:34,243 --> 01:24:36,203
Wait. Wait a minute.

964
01:24:36,370 --> 01:24:40,791
Are you talking about the bodies that are
supposed to be buried here on this farm?

965
01:24:40,958 --> 01:24:42,001
Yes, sir.

966
01:24:42,334 --> 01:24:43,752
Where?

967
01:24:43,919 --> 01:24:45,838
There's 15,000 acres out there.

968
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:49,508
I know exactly where they lay.

969
01:24:50,342 --> 01:24:52,678
Camp Five pasture.

970
01:24:52,845 --> 01:24:54,263
How?

971
01:24:54,931 --> 01:24:57,016
Abraham, how do you know?

972
01:24:58,434 --> 01:25:01,104
I was the coffin maker.

973
01:25:03,022 --> 01:25:05,191
Mr. Brubaker, this is Dr. Campbell.

974
01:25:05,358 --> 01:25:07,443
Yeah. Oh.

975
01:25:07,902 --> 01:25:11,740
Will you show me exactly
where tomorrow morning?

976
01:25:11,906 --> 01:25:13,533
Yes, sir.

977
01:25:16,369 --> 01:25:20,665
That board meeting ought to break up by
10:00, so I should be home by midnight.

978
01:25:20,832 --> 01:25:22,042
We'll hold the fort.

979
01:25:22,209 --> 01:25:26,088
I need five guys you can trust
with shovels right after breakfast.

980
01:25:26,255 --> 01:25:28,215
I got them, coach.

981
01:25:30,676 --> 01:25:34,221
- What you gonna do about Abraham?
- I got Purcell filling out forms.

982
01:25:34,388 --> 01:25:37,808
- And I'm gonna get him released-
- Why you wanna go and do that?

983
01:25:38,476 --> 01:25:40,061
Do what?

984
01:25:41,228 --> 01:25:44,732
Why don't you just leave him be?
I mean, all he knows is this place.

985
01:25:44,899 --> 01:25:48,736
You knew that he'd been in here
as long as he'd been in here. Didn't you?

986
01:25:48,903 --> 01:25:51,990
Just leave him alone.
He's not bothering nobody.

987
01:25:52,156 --> 01:25:54,826
You can't hide in prison forever,
Coombes.

988
01:25:58,413 --> 01:26:00,749
Stir up some hell, Henry.

989
01:26:13,053 --> 01:26:15,931
How you doing, Abraham?
Let me take that from you.

990
01:26:16,098 --> 01:26:17,766
You got an appointment.

991
01:26:17,933 --> 01:26:21,186
- What? What?
- A little business.

992
01:26:21,353 --> 01:26:23,480
Well, where we going?

993
01:26:27,234 --> 01:26:29,487
Doc wanna see you, Abe.

994
01:26:30,946 --> 01:26:33,115
I ain't sick.

995
01:26:45,795 --> 01:26:47,589
Hello, Abe.

996
01:26:51,885 --> 01:26:55,639
Abe, we got some questions
that have to be answered.

997
01:26:55,805 --> 01:26:58,642
Then you can get some sleep,
all right?

998
01:26:58,975 --> 01:27:01,269
Eddie, get that stuff off there.

999
01:27:01,436 --> 01:27:03,730
Up on this table here, Abe.

1000
01:27:23,668 --> 01:27:26,587
Hell, I know Captain Brubaker
is an expert at penology...

1001
01:27:26,754 --> 01:27:30,341
...but I think he's been
out of the mainstream too long.

1002
01:27:30,508 --> 01:27:33,886
There are 13 states,
my own included...

1003
01:27:34,053 --> 01:27:38,349
...that still rely on a leather strap
to control the convicts.

1004
01:27:38,808 --> 01:27:42,228
Because other people do it that way
doesn't per se make it right.

1005
01:27:42,395 --> 01:27:43,980
Oh, the hell it doesn't.

1006
01:27:44,147 --> 01:27:48,735
Cuts down on your time lost due to
convicts sitting in the hole, degenerating.

1007
01:27:49,027 --> 01:27:51,571
And it's a simple fact we have to face...

1008
01:27:51,738 --> 01:27:55,701
...that crop production at Wakefield's
down nearly 40 percent...

1009
01:27:55,868 --> 01:27:57,536
...this last quarter, since you-

1010
01:27:57,703 --> 01:27:59,913
But revenues are up 20 percent.

1011
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:02,249
If you would just give me a year...

1012
01:28:02,416 --> 01:28:05,377
...leave us alone,
and let us eat the food that we grow...

1013
01:28:05,544 --> 01:28:09,048
...and sell the rest on the open market,
I'll show you a profit.

1014
01:28:09,215 --> 01:28:10,966
I'll show you a cash surplus.

1015
01:28:11,175 --> 01:28:14,345
Fine. All we're saying is,
give us some warning, Mr. Brubaker.

1016
01:28:14,804 --> 01:28:17,014
So when you go doubling
the price of corn-

1017
01:28:17,181 --> 01:28:20,226
Out of the clear blue sky,
you cancel an age-old contract...

1018
01:28:20,393 --> 01:28:23,354
- ...with C.P. Woodward Lumber.
- There wasn't any contract.

1019
01:28:23,521 --> 01:28:25,440
He was using prisoners
for slave labor.

1020
01:28:25,607 --> 01:28:28,151
As far as corn,
we're still a dollar below market.

1021
01:28:28,318 --> 01:28:32,030
How much potential cash surplus
are you talking about here, Mr. Brubaker?

1022
01:28:32,197 --> 01:28:34,574
In farm accounting alone...

1023
01:28:35,367 --> 01:28:37,744
- ...a hundred and fifty thousand.
- Dollars?

1024
01:28:37,911 --> 01:28:40,664
- Yes, sir.
- Good Lord.

1025
01:28:40,831 --> 01:28:44,918
Sounds like we're gonna need some
high-powered Wall Street types...

1026
01:28:45,085 --> 01:28:47,421
...to help us figure out
where to put it all.

1027
01:28:47,588 --> 01:28:50,632
Well, I'd like to put it all
back into the facility.

1028
01:28:50,799 --> 01:28:52,885
The place is literally falling apart.

1029
01:28:53,177 --> 01:28:57,306
You've got dry rot, disease, rats all over,
not enough place for the men to sleep.

1030
01:28:57,473 --> 01:29:01,394
You've got a boiler that your own state
inspectors condemned six years ago.

1031
01:29:01,686 --> 01:29:04,272
We authorized a bid on a new boiler.
Am I wrong?

1032
01:29:04,438 --> 01:29:07,775
- Why won't your purchasing take my calls?
- I'm looking into that.

1033
01:29:07,942 --> 01:29:10,903
While we're at it,
let's look into things like...

1034
01:29:11,070 --> 01:29:13,615
...assaulting a doctor,
firing a state employee...

1035
01:29:13,781 --> 01:29:16,075
...who's been keeping the books
for years.

1036
01:29:16,242 --> 01:29:18,369
- Because he wasn't worth a-
- Well.

1037
01:29:18,536 --> 01:29:23,667
You're letting inmates take over the place,
inmates with fourth-grade educations.

1038
01:29:23,833 --> 01:29:26,211
They don't all have
fourth-grade education.

1039
01:29:26,378 --> 01:29:28,630
You're not gonna tell me
that's gonna work.

1040
01:29:28,797 --> 01:29:31,216
The point is these men have
to at least...

1041
01:29:31,383 --> 01:29:35,387
...feel like they're taking responsibility.
They'll change this place, not me.

1042
01:29:35,554 --> 01:29:39,141
- Well, what the hell are we paying you for?
- All right. Hold it.

1043
01:29:40,309 --> 01:29:45,272
The bottom line here is that you want
to make life real easy for those men.

1044
01:29:45,439 --> 01:29:48,567
- Don't you, Mr. Brubaker?
- No. Not at all.

1045
01:29:48,984 --> 01:29:50,194
I think it is.

1046
01:29:50,361 --> 01:29:53,364
I think you kind of like men
like that.

1047
01:29:53,531 --> 01:29:56,701
Maybe because they're reckless,
same as you.

1048
01:29:56,868 --> 01:30:01,664
They see something they don't like,
they shoot it up or burn it down.

1049
01:30:01,831 --> 01:30:04,167
Make up their own laws
as they go along.

1050
01:30:04,459 --> 01:30:06,336
I didn't make up those laws. You did.

1051
01:30:06,502 --> 01:30:08,713
Because they've held up
our businesses.

1052
01:30:09,297 --> 01:30:12,342
They've raped our daughters
and murdered our sons.

1053
01:30:12,509 --> 01:30:14,552
And so we make them wards
of the state...

1054
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:18,765
...which means we accept responsibility
to feed them, to clothe them...

1055
01:30:18,932 --> 01:30:20,559
...give them medical attention.

1056
01:30:20,726 --> 01:30:24,521
Not to starve them, not to torture them,
not to humiliate them.

1057
01:30:24,688 --> 01:30:28,525
And if you don't like the laws,
then change them.

1058
01:30:28,775 --> 01:30:30,235
In the meantime, it's my job-

1059
01:30:30,402 --> 01:30:32,946
It's your job to listen
to the people who pay you.

1060
01:30:33,113 --> 01:30:35,157
No, sir, it is my job
to reform a prison.

1061
01:30:35,449 --> 01:30:37,868
I'm not here to work
for a political party...

1062
01:30:38,035 --> 01:30:41,122
- ...or the state or a governor.
- May I butt in a second?

1063
01:30:41,288 --> 01:30:44,875
Let the record show that State Senator
Charles Hite desires to comment.

1064
01:30:45,042 --> 01:30:50,381
Mr. Brubaker, I think you owe it to yourself
to face some hard facts.

1065
01:30:50,548 --> 01:30:54,135
The people in this state have got
themselves a whole lot of problems...

1066
01:30:54,302 --> 01:30:58,848
...getting jobs, paying rent,
insurance premiums.

1067
01:30:59,015 --> 01:31:03,353
Now, come election time, they might
vote for your prison-reform thing...

1068
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:06,481
...but that's just a reflex.

1069
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:09,734
They don't want to hear
their taxes are being raised...

1070
01:31:09,901 --> 01:31:12,988
...to take care of murderers
and rapists.

1071
01:31:14,448 --> 01:31:18,619
That farm wasn't costing
anybody anything...

1072
01:31:18,785 --> 01:31:20,954
...before you got your hands on it.

1073
01:31:21,288 --> 01:31:23,582
You follow what I'm saying?

1074
01:31:24,041 --> 01:31:27,169
Why don't we go and build
them a putting green or a clubhouse?

1075
01:31:27,336 --> 01:31:31,966
Or a miniature golf course with
a hot, whirly, bubbly bath in it?

1076
01:31:33,134 --> 01:31:36,095
Why don't we build them a roof
that won't cave in on them?

1077
01:31:36,262 --> 01:31:37,930
That's enough.

1078
01:31:38,431 --> 01:31:40,725
- An insured roof this time.
- What do you mean?

1079
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:43,978
The collapsed roof isn't covered at all,
that's what.

1080
01:31:44,145 --> 01:31:47,065
But we do have coverage
for thrashing machines...

1081
01:31:47,232 --> 01:31:49,234
...bailers, swatters, a tractor.

1082
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:53,321
Sounds sensible to me to have the
things insured. I approved those policies.

1083
01:31:53,488 --> 01:31:56,449
You did more than that.
Your company sold us the policies.

1084
01:31:56,616 --> 01:32:01,246
The only trouble is, we don't have that
equipment on our farm. It doesn't exist.

1085
01:32:02,122 --> 01:32:06,835
What you have got, Mr. Brubaker,
is a piss-poor attitude.

1086
01:32:07,628 --> 01:32:10,255
I don't like you,
but that's beside the point.

1087
01:32:10,422 --> 01:32:11,465
No, it's not.

1088
01:32:11,632 --> 01:32:16,053
And still I'm telling you this
as a favor to Lillian Gray...

1089
01:32:16,220 --> 01:32:18,973
...who, for some unknown reason,
believes in you.

1090
01:32:19,265 --> 01:32:21,892
Do not- I repeat:

1091
01:32:22,059 --> 01:32:26,230
Do not come marching in here
from wherever the hell she found you...

1092
01:32:26,397 --> 01:32:30,359
...and presume to lecture us about
how to treat our fellow man.

1093
01:32:30,651 --> 01:32:33,571
We're all sitting here for free tonight,
except you.

1094
01:32:33,738 --> 01:32:36,783
We all got better places we could be.

1095
01:32:36,950 --> 01:32:38,409
So do I.

1096
01:32:38,576 --> 01:32:42,038
I think we all better have
a little food and calm down.

1097
01:32:56,428 --> 01:32:58,013
Brubaker!

1098
01:32:59,139 --> 01:33:01,600
How long you gonna last
pulling stunts like this?

1099
01:33:01,767 --> 01:33:04,853
What do you want to hear?
That I know exactly what I'm doing?

1100
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:07,857
I'm sorry I don't have
all the right answers for you.

1101
01:33:08,023 --> 01:33:11,026
Then make some up.
Because what you've got to understand...

1102
01:33:11,193 --> 01:33:13,446
...is that they'll pull the plug
on all this.

1103
01:33:13,988 --> 01:33:17,074
And if you're not in the system,
you can't change it.

1104
01:33:17,241 --> 01:33:20,953
Give them something. Let them think
they control you. That's the secret.

1105
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:23,873
You know who the real obstacles
to prison reform are?

1106
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:26,668
It's not John Deach
or Senator Whatever-His-Name-Is.

1107
01:33:26,834 --> 01:33:29,045
- Hite.
- Hite. It's prison reformers...

1108
01:33:29,212 --> 01:33:30,296
...pseudo-reformers.

1109
01:33:30,463 --> 01:33:33,717
People that want to say the right thing,
be at the right place...

1110
01:33:33,883 --> 01:33:36,303
...get in the paper,
and get nothing done.

1111
01:33:37,137 --> 01:33:39,431
You see everything
from Brubaker's point of view.

1112
01:33:39,598 --> 01:33:41,933
Everything you do is right,
everyone else is absurd.

1113
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:45,729
I don't know what's right or
wrong. Everybody's got their own version.

1114
01:33:45,896 --> 01:33:48,565
I'm just interested in what works.

1115
01:33:48,982 --> 01:33:51,485
There's no way
to beat guys like that.

1116
01:33:51,652 --> 01:33:54,113
You can't toe the line
because it keeps changing.

1117
01:33:54,279 --> 01:33:56,448
You have to be smarter than they are.

1118
01:33:57,157 --> 01:34:00,077
I've locked the goddamn keys
in the car.

1119
01:34:04,915 --> 01:34:06,459
God!

1120
01:34:16,344 --> 01:34:20,640
For the first time, it's occurring to those
prisoners that they don't have to take...

1121
01:34:20,807 --> 01:34:24,227
...everything shoved at them,
because they're still human beings.

1122
01:34:24,394 --> 01:34:26,271
So maybe someday,
when they do get out...

1123
01:34:26,438 --> 01:34:29,983
...they won't rape John Deach's daughter
or murder his son.

1124
01:34:30,150 --> 01:34:32,736
Bravo, but you're full of shit.

1125
01:34:32,903 --> 01:34:35,447
Just not enough to make things
work in that prison.

1126
01:34:35,614 --> 01:34:39,660
- The real problem is out here.
- Out here they don't want to hear you.

1127
01:34:39,827 --> 01:34:41,829
And they don't want to see me.

1128
01:34:41,995 --> 01:34:43,747
So why do you bother?

1129
01:34:43,914 --> 01:34:47,877
Why do you spend day after day sitting
in rooms with people like that...

1130
01:34:48,043 --> 01:34:50,337
...and let them make a fool
out of you?

1131
01:34:51,464 --> 01:34:54,592
Because sometimes you don't lose.

1132
01:34:55,343 --> 01:34:58,304
And if you can't figure out
how to play these people...

1133
01:34:58,471 --> 01:35:00,223
...you are gonna self-destruct.

1134
01:35:00,890 --> 01:35:03,518
And then you'll be of no use to me.

1135
01:37:55,612 --> 01:37:57,489
Turn on the lights.

1136
01:38:13,506 --> 01:38:16,509
I just got the call from the tower.

1137
01:38:17,468 --> 01:38:21,848
Find out why the man on duty
in Tower One didn't report anything.

1138
01:38:23,015 --> 01:38:24,726
Those guys at night, they....

1139
01:38:24,892 --> 01:38:27,103
Find out!

1140
01:38:52,337 --> 01:38:54,089
You had to listen to him, huh?

1141
01:38:55,341 --> 01:38:58,344
- What?
- What?

1142
01:38:59,053 --> 01:39:01,889
Oh, I don't believe men like you.

1143
01:39:02,223 --> 01:39:03,724
You're dangerous men.

1144
01:39:03,891 --> 01:39:06,269
You start wars
and let other people fight them.

1145
01:39:06,435 --> 01:39:08,646
You come and talk about,
"Do this, do that.

1146
01:39:08,813 --> 01:39:10,523
Think this way. Be this way. "

1147
01:39:10,690 --> 01:39:13,443
You stick a sign in a fool's hand
and say, "Follow me.

1148
01:39:13,609 --> 01:39:16,946
I got the thing figured out.
We can change things for the better. "

1149
01:39:18,573 --> 01:39:20,283
Well, that's a lot of bullshit!

1150
01:39:20,450 --> 01:39:21,993
There's only one thing you do.

1151
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:24,913
And that's get people killed!

1152
01:39:29,626 --> 01:39:31,002
Maybe you're right.

1153
01:39:52,566 --> 01:39:54,944
- You don't wanna go in there now.
- But I have-

1154
01:39:55,111 --> 01:39:56,904
Not now.

1155
01:41:27,748 --> 01:41:29,875
- Warden.
- Yeah?

1156
01:41:30,042 --> 01:41:33,546
There's a Lillian Gray on the phone.

1157
01:41:33,713 --> 01:41:35,881
She's saying it's urgent.

1158
01:42:10,459 --> 01:42:12,461
I'm through talking.

1159
01:42:15,714 --> 01:42:17,925
I can't figure out how you found out.

1160
01:42:18,092 --> 01:42:21,303
Nothing happens at that prison
that doesn't get out.

1161
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:24,181
- Now you're sounding paranoid.
- I'm not paranoid.

1162
01:42:24,348 --> 01:42:26,392
The enemy's real.

1163
01:42:29,395 --> 01:42:31,314
All right. You know the fairgrounds?

1164
01:42:31,481 --> 01:42:34,567
- The auction house where we sell cattle?
- I'll find it.

1165
01:42:34,734 --> 01:42:37,403
- What time in the morning?
- Eight o'clock.

1166
01:42:37,612 --> 01:42:39,447
I'll meet- No.
Make it earlier, 7.

1167
01:42:39,614 --> 01:42:42,325
I have to be back.
I'll see you at 7.

1168
01:43:13,649 --> 01:43:15,151
I said alone.

1169
01:43:15,317 --> 01:43:17,361
He's a friend.

1170
01:43:17,612 --> 01:43:20,823
You haven't actually
found anything yet, have you?

1171
01:43:20,990 --> 01:43:24,243
- No.
- Doesn't matter. It's having its effect.

1172
01:43:44,264 --> 01:43:46,099
- You called him?
- Didn't have to.

1173
01:43:46,433 --> 01:43:48,810
The senator called Lillian
last night himself.

1174
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:04,160
Well, let me put this as simple as I can,
Mr. Brubaker.

1175
01:44:04,326 --> 01:44:06,203
You've gotta stop digging.

1176
01:44:06,370 --> 01:44:07,622
Why?

1177
01:44:07,788 --> 01:44:09,457
Because you have been salaried...

1178
01:44:09,624 --> 01:44:13,544
...to run one of the best-conceived prisons
in this country, sir.

1179
01:44:13,878 --> 01:44:18,007
Because although Wakefield
is admittedly an imperfect institution...

1180
01:44:18,174 --> 01:44:19,801
...much like America herself...

1181
01:44:20,009 --> 01:44:23,054
...she is nonetheless a grand experiment.

1182
01:44:23,263 --> 01:44:26,266
A government of the man,
for the man...

1183
01:44:26,891 --> 01:44:28,393
...by the man.

1184
01:44:29,227 --> 01:44:34,191
Plus the fact that it's the only prison
in the United States that's shown a profit.

1185
01:44:34,357 --> 01:44:37,653
- What is this horseshit?
- Listen to what he's saying, Henry.

1186
01:44:37,819 --> 01:44:40,739
I think the senator's
exhibiting uncommon foresight.

1187
01:44:43,492 --> 01:44:46,245
We're gonna try and salvage something
here today.

1188
01:44:46,412 --> 01:44:48,831
We're gonna work with you on this,
Mr. Brubaker.

1189
01:44:48,998 --> 01:44:51,834
Release funds.
You can hire people.

1190
01:44:52,001 --> 01:44:55,171
Get you that...boiler.

1191
01:44:56,422 --> 01:45:00,176
We'll sit down and draw up some plans
for some more barracks.

1192
01:45:00,343 --> 01:45:02,220
Get yourself a couple new tractors.

1193
01:45:02,386 --> 01:45:04,680
How many men are buried out there?

1194
01:45:05,264 --> 01:45:07,725
You wouldn't even know, would you?

1195
01:45:08,059 --> 01:45:12,856
That field was an old paupers' graveyard
when my granddaddy was alive.

1196
01:45:13,273 --> 01:45:16,651
- It's a matter of historical record.
- I'm talking about murder.

1197
01:45:17,444 --> 01:45:20,155
It's time to cut through the bull.

1198
01:45:20,322 --> 01:45:23,658
Grave robbery's a felony in this state.

1199
01:45:23,825 --> 01:45:27,704
You don't want to wind up
in your own prison, Mr. Brubaker.

1200
01:45:31,792 --> 01:45:34,795
- He means it.
- I'm calling the governor.

1201
01:45:34,962 --> 01:45:37,798
The governor already knows.

1202
01:45:51,312 --> 01:45:52,814
We're ordering you to.

1203
01:45:53,272 --> 01:45:55,191
I don't like being put in a corner.

1204
01:45:55,358 --> 01:45:58,945
Listen, Edwards, stay out of this.
You're just another token liberal...

1205
01:45:59,112 --> 01:46:02,991
...that doesn't know shit.
I was hired to reform this prison.

1206
01:46:03,158 --> 01:46:06,661
If that means putting the prison board
behind bars, I'll do it.

1207
01:46:06,870 --> 01:46:09,748
Already been behind bars, Brubaker.

1208
01:46:09,915 --> 01:46:14,711
Two years in Atlanta for real,
another few days in disguise.

1209
01:46:14,878 --> 01:46:18,507
So you listen to this nice token liberal
for a minute.

1210
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:21,051
Because you got a high opinion
of yourself.

1211
01:46:22,427 --> 01:46:24,304
Most of it I actually agree with.

1212
01:46:24,596 --> 01:46:28,434
But you don't really understand
inmate mentality.

1213
01:46:28,601 --> 01:46:30,311
If you did...

1214
01:46:30,477 --> 01:46:34,607
...you'd know that asshole is ready to
offer you anything you need for those men.

1215
01:46:35,316 --> 01:46:36,984
It's not enough.

1216
01:46:37,401 --> 01:46:38,819
Henry...

1217
01:46:38,986 --> 01:46:42,782
...stop the digging.
Concentrate on the men who are still alive.

1218
01:46:42,949 --> 01:46:45,368
We are winning.
We have leverage now.

1219
01:46:46,119 --> 01:46:49,289
- I've got a prison to run.
- I hope so.

1220
01:48:35,065 --> 01:48:38,401
Bullen!
Come over here and bring some guys.

1221
01:48:38,568 --> 01:48:41,613
Zaranska! Elwood!
Romeo! Beasley!

1222
01:48:41,780 --> 01:48:43,073
Start digging right here.

1223
01:48:45,867 --> 01:48:47,786
Over there, you see that?

1224
01:49:07,306 --> 01:49:11,185
Hey, Brubaker!
I believe we've got us one.

1225
01:49:18,359 --> 01:49:20,111
Brubaker!
Got one in this hole!

1226
01:49:23,698 --> 01:49:26,242
Hold it. Hold it.
Careful.

1227
01:49:28,244 --> 01:49:30,747
Okay, careful.
Scoop it out, handful at a time.

1228
01:49:31,248 --> 01:49:34,209
Easy.
Spoon it out if you have to!

1229
01:49:34,376 --> 01:49:36,044
- Careful.
Don't mess up evidence.

1230
01:49:36,211 --> 01:49:39,256
- Got one over here, boss!
- Easy, guys, easy.

1231
01:49:41,383 --> 01:49:43,051
Just carefully pry this off.

1232
01:49:43,218 --> 01:49:46,055
Don't touch anything you find inside.

1233
01:49:49,516 --> 01:49:51,727
Don't touch anything inside.

1234
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:55,815
Zaranska!

1235
01:49:55,981 --> 01:49:58,067
- All I got is this.
- Here. Hold it.

1236
01:49:58,234 --> 01:50:02,196
- I can't get it! When I move it, it cracks.
- Careful. Careful.

1237
01:50:03,406 --> 01:50:05,908
- Now, don't touch it.
- All right.

1238
01:50:21,299 --> 01:50:23,927
Whole goddamn place has gone crazy.

1239
01:50:24,094 --> 01:50:26,138
They got those guys digging up...

1240
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:29,474
...diseased carcasses of men
dead and rotting for 30 years.

1241
01:50:31,101 --> 01:50:34,104
That is because the man
took away the reason to be smart...

1242
01:50:34,271 --> 01:50:36,398
...and have some self-respect.

1243
01:50:36,607 --> 01:50:38,859
Turning the whole damn place
upside down.

1244
01:50:39,109 --> 01:50:42,613
- Prison board will stop him.
- Bullshit, Floyd!

1245
01:50:43,948 --> 01:50:46,867
They already tried to buy
the dumb bastard, but....

1246
01:50:47,451 --> 01:50:49,120
So...

1247
01:50:49,829 --> 01:50:51,414
...what do we do?

1248
01:50:54,542 --> 01:50:56,961
What about it, Dickie?

1249
01:50:57,420 --> 01:50:59,797
You got the man's ear.
He want to wake up dead?

1250
01:50:59,964 --> 01:51:02,926
There's talk around here.
I can't control it anymore.

1251
01:51:03,885 --> 01:51:07,263
You know, you're the only one
doing all the talking, Huey.

1252
01:51:13,436 --> 01:51:17,816
Yeah, that's great. And all because
one old, damn deaf fool starts-

1253
01:51:51,809 --> 01:51:53,853
Um....

1254
01:51:55,480 --> 01:51:58,441
Eddie, come here.

1255
01:52:04,364 --> 01:52:06,825
It's time to go.
It's time to check out.

1256
01:52:06,992 --> 01:52:09,995
- Why?
- Why?

1257
01:52:11,371 --> 01:52:14,792
What do you mean?
It's too loose. It's crazy.

1258
01:52:14,958 --> 01:52:17,920
They're digging up bodies.

1259
01:52:18,087 --> 01:52:21,757
It's too late to look up the answer.

1260
01:52:22,341 --> 01:52:25,052
Well, I figure I'm gonna stick around.

1261
01:52:25,970 --> 01:52:28,055
Take my chances here.

1262
01:52:42,529 --> 01:52:44,197
Skull lying under the left arm.

1263
01:52:44,364 --> 01:52:48,243
Both lower leg bones severed from thighs
and stacked in beside the knees.

1264
01:52:48,660 --> 01:52:51,705
The legs appear to have been cut off.
Why?

1265
01:52:51,872 --> 01:52:55,125
It's easier to shorten the man
than it is to lengthen the box.

1266
01:52:55,292 --> 01:52:57,085
How long has he been in the ground?

1267
01:52:57,711 --> 01:53:00,339
Well, I'm just not a pathologist,
not a coroner-

1268
01:53:00,505 --> 01:53:02,216
Doc, I need some answers fast.

1269
01:53:02,382 --> 01:53:06,053
- Causes of death, dates of death.
- If I took them to the state hospital.

1270
01:53:06,220 --> 01:53:08,889
Do it. Purcell, call the TV stations,
newspapers.

1271
01:53:09,056 --> 01:53:12,184
Tell them we just found
four murdered bodies in our pasture.

1272
01:53:12,351 --> 01:53:13,727
There's probably more.

1273
01:53:14,228 --> 01:53:16,689
- You're gonna start a stampede.
- Exactly.

1274
01:53:20,693 --> 01:53:23,070
Mr. Brubaker!
Hey, Mr. Brubaker!

1275
01:53:23,237 --> 01:53:24,906
We got a runaway vehicle.

1276
01:53:25,073 --> 01:53:27,033
- And Huey Rauch is in it.
- Huey?

1277
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:29,535
- Yes, sir.
- Why?

1278
01:53:30,036 --> 01:53:31,829
Well, tell him!
He killed Abraham.

1279
01:53:39,921 --> 01:53:42,549
Where would he be?
Where would he go?

1280
01:53:42,924 --> 01:53:44,676
Pinky's.

1281
01:53:45,385 --> 01:53:47,054
Maybe.

1282
01:53:52,392 --> 01:53:53,727
Alive.

1283
01:53:53,894 --> 01:53:55,813
I want him alive.

1284
01:54:19,837 --> 01:54:21,422
Try over there.

1285
01:54:42,694 --> 01:54:46,240
I ain't open yet.
Ain't open for business.

1286
01:54:54,457 --> 01:54:55,875
Hey.

1287
01:54:56,041 --> 01:54:58,711
What the hell's going on here?
You guys crazy?

1288
01:55:01,214 --> 01:55:05,134
- Who you making the sandwiches for?
- Nobody!

1289
01:55:07,762 --> 01:55:09,764
- Where's Huey Rauch?
- Who?

1290
01:55:09,931 --> 01:55:13,059
- Where's your sister at, Pinky?
- What, Carol?

1291
01:55:15,854 --> 01:55:18,315
- Where does that door go?
- My house.

1292
01:55:18,481 --> 01:55:20,108
Open it.

1293
01:55:20,275 --> 01:55:22,319
Door's locked.
Ain't been used for years.

1294
01:55:24,070 --> 01:55:25,614
I'll go around to the front.

1295
01:55:26,740 --> 01:55:28,617
Hey! This is my castle!

1296
01:55:28,784 --> 01:55:31,411
You can't walk all over me!
I'm calling the law!

1297
01:55:31,578 --> 01:55:32,913
- Then call them.
- I will!

1298
01:55:33,080 --> 01:55:34,998
For now, shut up.

1299
01:57:12,641 --> 01:57:14,059
Hold it!

1300
01:57:37,583 --> 01:57:39,627
He's dead.

1301
01:57:39,961 --> 01:57:41,713
He's dead.

1302
01:58:02,109 --> 01:58:06,238
You've examined all the remains
in what? A laboratory environment?

1303
01:58:06,405 --> 01:58:08,073
Yes, I have.

1304
01:58:08,866 --> 01:58:12,077
Dr. Gregory, what about
all these broken bones?

1305
01:58:12,244 --> 01:58:15,664
They may be due to a blunt trauma.
But you need to temper that...

1306
01:58:15,831 --> 01:58:18,876
...with the knowledge those fractures
could have occurred...

1307
01:58:19,043 --> 01:58:23,005
...several years after death as a result
of a cave-in of the grave walls.

1308
01:58:45,362 --> 01:58:48,782
You don't have to be in practice 20 years
to recognize a skull...

1309
01:58:48,949 --> 01:58:51,410
...violently crushed
to the size of a grapefruit.

1310
01:58:51,994 --> 01:58:57,791
Son, I have got the forensic expert's report
sitting in front of me here.

1311
01:58:57,958 --> 01:59:02,880
According to all my scientific friends,
who are very knowledgeable in this area...

1312
01:59:03,047 --> 01:59:05,216
...it's not all that clear on that point.

1313
01:59:05,382 --> 01:59:08,219
You've got a couple of dozen or so
indigent inmates...

1314
01:59:08,386 --> 01:59:10,638
...buried in an old paupers' graveyard.

1315
01:59:10,805 --> 01:59:13,307
Anything else I think is pure speculation.

1316
01:59:13,474 --> 01:59:18,021
Paupers don't die in pieces, do they,
Dr. Gregory?

1317
01:59:18,187 --> 01:59:21,357
I'm gonna put it to you,
Mr. Partridge, that this board...

1318
01:59:21,524 --> 01:59:24,360
...is quite capable
of questioning its witnesses.

1319
01:59:24,527 --> 01:59:27,238
And that this whole procedure-

1320
01:59:27,906 --> 01:59:32,202
This whole procedure could just as easily
have been a closed hearing.

1321
01:59:32,369 --> 01:59:36,415
What would be in the best interest
of all concerned and people of this state...

1322
01:59:36,581 --> 01:59:39,960
...might be if we could get
Mr. Brubaker's thoughts on his firing.

1323
01:59:40,127 --> 01:59:42,880
Our primary responsibility
at this point in time...

1324
01:59:43,088 --> 01:59:48,802
...is, number one, to facilitate the decent
Christian re-interment of the remains.

1325
01:59:48,969 --> 01:59:54,266
Two, to regain control over this institution
that our warden has relinquished!

1326
01:59:54,683 --> 01:59:57,978
We don't go having any more gunfights
in our streets.

1327
01:59:58,145 --> 01:59:59,689
How about that, Mr. Brubaker?

1328
01:59:59,855 --> 02:00:03,943
Any comment on what your thoughts
might be on priority?

1329
02:00:05,736 --> 02:00:07,405
Priority?

1330
02:00:09,907 --> 02:00:12,994
I tried to reach the governor
and give him my thoughts.

1331
02:00:13,161 --> 02:00:17,457
But we all know what a busy man he is.

1332
02:00:17,624 --> 02:00:19,918
I think the board can handle this.

1333
02:00:20,543 --> 02:00:25,215
I was going to suggest that the best way
in the future to prevent any trouble...

1334
02:00:25,382 --> 02:00:29,386
...or confusion or a waste
of the taxpayers' time and money...

1335
02:00:29,553 --> 02:00:32,347
...would be next time
a man's sentenced to Wakefield...

1336
02:00:32,514 --> 02:00:34,308
...take him out and shoot him.

1337
02:00:34,766 --> 02:00:40,314
All right, that's enough! You stay here
and answer to those remarks, mister!

1338
02:00:40,481 --> 02:00:42,775
Miss Gray can explain them.

1339
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:45,444
I believe you speak the same language.

1340
02:00:51,701 --> 02:00:54,495
- You want me to bring him back?
- No.

1341
02:00:55,746 --> 02:00:57,415
Nobody touches him.

1342
02:01:15,600 --> 02:01:17,978
I figured I hadn't heard the last from you.

1343
02:01:18,145 --> 02:01:21,857
I want to know why
you always think you can just walk out.

1344
02:01:22,024 --> 02:01:23,901
That's murder they're talking about.

1345
02:01:24,067 --> 02:01:28,280
If they condone it, you can't turn around
and tell these men why they're locked up.

1346
02:01:28,447 --> 02:01:30,449
It's one standard for everybody.

1347
02:01:31,617 --> 02:01:34,203
And you don't see any options?
No middle ground?

1348
02:01:34,370 --> 02:01:37,373
No. I don't see playing politics
with the truth, Lillian.

1349
02:01:38,624 --> 02:01:40,334
No way to compromise?

1350
02:01:40,501 --> 02:01:44,797
Oh, on strategy maybe,
but not on principle.

1351
02:01:45,590 --> 02:01:47,133
But that's what I-

1352
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:51,387
- Goddamn it, I agree with you!
- No, you don't.

1353
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:53,973
Not really.

1354
02:02:07,446 --> 02:02:11,742
The business
of this here prison is farming.

1355
02:02:11,909 --> 02:02:16,288
Not digging up good pastureland
looking for old graveyards.

1356
02:02:16,955 --> 02:02:18,999
What's done is done.

1357
02:02:19,833 --> 02:02:23,379
We got ourselves plenty
to think about today.

1358
02:02:23,546 --> 02:02:26,507
Never mind dwelling about yesterday.

1359
02:02:28,509 --> 02:02:34,140
We all gotta get back
to the basics at hand.

1360
02:02:35,141 --> 02:02:38,728
And that's why I'm standing up here,
saying to you convicts...

1361
02:02:38,895 --> 02:02:42,941
...straight out, how Rory Poke
is gonna run this here prison.

1362
02:02:43,191 --> 02:02:48,571
So we won't be wasting any more time
misunderstanding each other.

1363
02:02:51,324 --> 02:02:55,871
I am a firm believer in discipline.

1364
02:02:57,038 --> 02:02:59,333
A convict does his fair share of work...

1365
02:02:59,499 --> 02:03:02,044
...and he's not gonna have anything
to worry about.

1366
02:03:02,210 --> 02:03:07,007
But I know that that ain't been happening
around here lately.

1367
02:03:08,717 --> 02:03:11,011
And there ain't no crop...

1368
02:03:12,179 --> 02:03:14,348
...in no field...

1369
02:03:14,557 --> 02:03:18,102
...at no prison that I'm in charge of...

1370
02:03:18,269 --> 02:03:20,229
...that's gonna die in the fields.

1371
02:03:21,105 --> 02:03:26,152
The trusties will divide you up
into work groups.

1372
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:28,404
You listen now.

1373
02:03:28,571 --> 02:03:31,157
Give them trouble,
and they've got my permission...

1374
02:03:31,324 --> 02:03:34,828
...to see to it that the troublemaker
is punished.

1375
02:03:35,078 --> 02:03:36,579
Hard.

1376
02:03:37,205 --> 02:03:40,291
Fair, but hard.

1377
02:03:40,458 --> 02:03:43,086
I packed up all
your personal things I could find.

1378
02:03:43,253 --> 02:03:47,591
If I've missed anything
or you have any mail, I'll take care of it.

1379
02:03:49,259 --> 02:03:50,594
Don't worry.

1380
02:03:54,890 --> 02:03:56,850
Hey, Brubaker.

1381
02:03:59,019 --> 02:04:01,522
I'm getting ready to tell you something.

1382
02:04:11,115 --> 02:04:12,783
You were right.

1383
02:04:13,451 --> 02:04:16,496
POKE:
I don't believe it makes no sense...

1384
02:04:16,662 --> 02:04:20,375
...having some convicts
looking more important than others.

1385
02:04:20,792 --> 02:04:25,421
Trusties is the only kind of men
that's earned...

1386
02:04:28,091 --> 02:04:32,596
That's what you're gonna discover
Rory Poke is all about.

1387
02:04:32,846 --> 02:04:35,974
Earning your privileges.

1388
02:04:36,641 --> 02:04:42,356
There ain't gonna be no more warden
playing favorites at Wakefield.

1389
02:04:42,856 --> 02:04:46,068
Ain't gonna be no more inmate council.

1390
02:04:46,985 --> 02:04:51,657
You've gotta earn privileges from now on.

1391
02:04:58,998 --> 02:05:01,500
That convict in the rear there.
Get back in line!

1392
02:05:01,667 --> 02:05:03,628
Get back into formation!

1393
02:05:04,003 --> 02:05:06,464
You men! You-! Get back in line!

1394
02:05:06,631 --> 02:05:09,634
Get back into formation!
You'll get a taste of the strap!

1395
02:05:23,356 --> 02:05:24,608
What the hell-?
