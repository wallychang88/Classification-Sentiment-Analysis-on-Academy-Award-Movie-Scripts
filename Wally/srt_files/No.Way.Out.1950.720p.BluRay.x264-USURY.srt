1
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:12,156
I'm sorry.
We don't give out that information.

2
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:18,746
Thank you.
Grosse County Hospital.

3
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,748
Where? Hold on.

4
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,587
Wilson.

5
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,841
A shooting. Two men.

6
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,928
Middleton and Bay. Right.

7
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,057
7:58.

8
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,895
Here we go, Doc.

9
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:14,135
- Hi, Lefty.
- Hey, Luth. What do ya know?

10
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:17,054
- I've been lookin' for you.
- What's up?

11
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:26,021
- Dr. Smith, call Operator Two.
- Hello, Brooks.

12
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:28,440
Good evening, Doctor.

13
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:30,734
- Dr. Smith, call Operator Two.
- Good evening.

14
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,736
Good evening.

15
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:39,743
Dr. Thomas
wanted in Surgery.

16
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:42,329
- Brooks.
- Dr. Thomas wanted in Surgery.

17
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:44,415
- Well, how does it feel?
- The reaction hasn't set in yet.

18
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,334
Like a woman who's just had a baby,
I won't believe it till I see it.

19
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:49,461
- I hear it was pretty tough.
- It was for me.

20
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,463
But then I don't think
state boards can be tough enough.

21
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:53,465
Well, that's one thing
doctors agree on.

22
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:57,094
After they pass the examination, they all
want it made tougher for the next one.

23
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:04,727
- Congratulations, Doc.
- Same to you, Eddie.

24
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,105
- Anytime you need any help in Pathology...
- I'll look you up.

25
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:16,322
Well, it looks like a busy night.

26
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:18,741
Good chance to polish up
your hem stitching.

27
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:22,077
That's what tickles my wife
when I tell her I sew people up.

28
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:24,496
She won't let me work on an old sock.

29
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:27,249
I'll bet she's happy you finished your year
at County, huh?

30
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:31,212
Yeah, I suppose so.
That part of it hasn't been much fun.

31
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:35,216
It's no good a man's wife supporting him,
his mother and the rest of the family.

32
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:39,220
- Well, it's over now.
- Dr. Wharton, call Prison Ward.

33
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:43,474
Dr. Wharton, call Prison Ward.

34
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,106
Dr. Wharton.

35
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,901
Oh, I see.
Well, Brooks will cover.

36
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,903
Thank you.

37
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:02,868
One of the interns in the prison ward
has reported sick.

38
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,870
- You take over until he gets back.
- Right.

39
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,997
Oh, Dr. Wharton...

40
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:10,793
- I've applied to stay on here another year.
- Junior resident? Why?

41
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,087
Because I think it's more important
than a few extra dollars.

42
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,673
A little easier living.
I've got a lot to learn.

43
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,759
- Well, you'll always have a lot to learn.
- I don't mean it just that way.

44
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:22,054
I'm not sure of myself yet
in many ways.

45
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,515
I think I need a little more time
than the others.

46
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,851
- I'll be happy to have you with me for another year.
- I was hoping you'd say that.

47
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:32,648
I think that if I left you now, I'd never again
find anyone as considerate and interested.

48
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:36,986
My interest in you, Brooks, is no greater
than in any other good doctor on my service.

49
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:40,406
- Good night.
- Good night.

50
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,411
Hello.

51
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:47,413
Prison Ward, Brooks.
You on your way?

52
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:50,249
- As soon as I get my whites on.
- Be right up.

53
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:59,425
Dr. Billings, call Ward 7.

54
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,469
Dr. Billings, call Ward 7.

55
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,347
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Try Information right over there.

56
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:07,349
Right there.
That's the window right there.

57
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:09,893
Hold it, Lefty.

58
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,895
All the way up tonight, Lefty,
I'm in Prison Ward.

59
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,148
You mind going down?
Someone's leaning on emergency.

60
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,150
Right.

61
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,739
Say, what about that new exam
you had to take?

62
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,700
- I thought you was a regular doctor already.
- State board?

63
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,411
Everybody's gotta take it so as you
can get your license to practice.

64
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,997
Well, the boys were saying it was
just for coloured doctors.

65
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,291
Well, you can tell the boys
it's for all doctors.

66
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,544
- I bet they laid it on you.
- No more than anybody else.

67
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,881
They don't even ask your name.
They give you a number.

68
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,883
They look at your number.
They know.

69
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:44,011
- They got ways of knowing.
- Oh, why don't you quit?

70
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,148
- What's it about?
- For the prison ward.

71
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,942
Shot in the leg, both of them.
I caught 'em sticking up a gas station.

72
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,944
A couple of two-for-a-nickel
tough guys.

73
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:05,616
Hey, Officer, will you bend down
for a minute? I wanna polish your badge.

74
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:09,244
- You sure you hit this one in the leg only?
- Right over the knee, one shot.

75
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:12,122
And what's it to you?

76
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,376
Clean that up.
Where's your mop?

77
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,295
- Take 'em away.
- Hey, Mac, I thought this was a hospital.

78
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,756
You got mixed up.
We're at the Cotton Club.

79
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,392
How you doing, Johnny?

80
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,435
N-Not so bad.

81
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,437
No, no, I'm over here, Johnny.

82
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:38,649
Not so bad.

83
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:41,360
Aw, a slug in the leg don't mean a thing.
We'll be outta here in a week.

84
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,987
A week, is it? I'll make book
it's for two years or more.

85
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,989
- Oh, dry up.
- For how much, big mouth?

86
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,075
The Biddle brothers.
Look at 'em.

87
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,577
Ray, he's the king of Beaver Canal.

88
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:53,330
Yeah, he's beat up more women
and old people than anybody.

89
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:55,457
Such bright boys.

90
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:59,461
They don't figure a cop also knows
a gas station's a setup in the rain.

91
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:01,922
I pops this one through the window,
and he drops.

92
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,258
Then this one,
he gets hysterical or something...

93
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,343
and he runs toward me
instead of his car.

94
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,346
Then when he sees me,
he turns around and runs into the pump.

95
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,974
Then he misses me with a bullet,
and I hit him with one.

96
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,351
Will you tell me something
about your brother?

97
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:18,355
Sure, sure.
What would you like to know?

98
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:22,901
Has he ever been confused before in his sense
of direction or maybe his sense of touch?

99
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,112
Well, let me see.

100
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:28,365
Every time Beaver Canal went over
to clean up nigger town...

101
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,617
Johnny knew just
what direction it was.

102
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:33,328
- You shut up.
- Of course, he could have just smelled where to go.

103
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:36,540
Shut up. Shut up.
You're talking to a doctor.

104
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,375
A doctor?

105
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,377
Him?

106
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:43,714
Lie back and lie still.
You're in my charge.

107
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:50,304
- Who's your friends, Kowalski?
- Public enemies one and two.

108
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:54,266
- I'm Dr. Brooks.
- Yeah, they said you'd be up.

109
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,477
- Your first time here, isn't it, Doc?
- That's right.

110
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,479
- Have an empty room?
- Number five.

111
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,731
Number five. All right,
let's get them in there right away.

112
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,941
Won't you wanna be bookin' them first?
I'd like to turn them over.

113
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,569
I think it's important to examine them first.
Him in particular.

114
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,571
Okay.

115
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,119
I don't want him.
I want a white doctor.

116
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,121
We'll turn the lights out,
and you won't know the difference.

117
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,248
- Haven't I got any rights?
- No!

118
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,292
Will you be needing
some instruments?

119
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,754
- You keep the cases locked?
- This ain't no maternity ward, Doc.

120
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:28,592
Just get their pants off. Don't touch
the dressings. I'll do that myself.

121
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,686
Now there's a gadget
I've always wondered about.

122
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,688
What are you gonna do,
wrap something around his leg?

123
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:43,690
It's for examining
the interior of the eyes.

124
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,901
But they got shot in the leg.

125
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,903
- We're ready, Doctor.
- Thank you.

126
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,697
- I gave them cigarettes, okay?
- No.

127
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,394
What are you doing to him?

128
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,693
Just try to hold
your head like this.

129
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,029
Don't do it, Johnny.
Don't do what he says.

130
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,289
What's the big idea?
What are you gonna do now?

131
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:26,251
Look, I'm trying to help your brother.
Why don't you just shut up?

132
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,463
You watch yourself. black boy.
Watch how you talk to me.

133
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,465
Just shut up.

134
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:44,311
Keep looking up at the ceiling.
Attaboy.

135
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:48,750
Say, Doc, I don't recall anyone
using that thing before.

136
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,712
- You gonna shoot something in his eye?
- A spinal tap.

137
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,968
- A spinal tap?
- Checking the amount of pressure on the brain.

138
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,512
First the eyes, now the spine.

139
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,640
Kowalski, you sure you shot
these guys in the leg?

140
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,642
- You ever seen this doctor before?
- No.

141
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,311
- Then maybe you'd better check.
- No, I know we got one of them in the house.

142
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,981
This must be him.

143
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,802
Just rest easy, boy.

144
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,847
You help me so as I can help you.

145
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,603
Keep your legs in the same position.

146
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:38,777
- Now just rest easy.
- Doc, don't hurt him. Don't do nothin' to Johnny.

147
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,571
He didn't do nothin' to you. He didn't
even say anything. I was the only one.

148
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,449
Remember, Doc? I was out of my mind,
you know, gettin' shot and all.

149
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,285
Doc, leave Johnny alone.
Leave him alone.

150
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,668
Maybe one of you oughta go in
and see what's happening.

151
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,254
- When a doctor wants an orderly, he'll send for one.
- Well, just in case maybe...

152
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,881
Somebody stop him! He's killing Johnny!

153
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,843
Somebody stop him!
Doctor, stop!

154
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,095
- Everything all right, Doctor?
- He killed him.

155
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,264
He killed him!
That dirty nigger killed him!

156
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,558
You shut up.
Anything wrong, Doc?

157
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,603
- He's dead.
- He killed him!

158
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:16,106
He killed him, I tell ya.
I saw him.

159
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:20,235
He took it out on Johnny. He wanted it
to be me, but he took it out on Johnny.

160
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:23,321
I'll get you for this,
you black rat.

161
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,907
If they hang me,
I'll get you for it.

162
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:29,119
Johnny. Johnny!

163
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,789
Johnny.
Oh, Johnny, Johnny.

164
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:39,129
For a symptom like this to be significant,
it should have an historical basis.

165
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,631
That's true, but the accumulation
of symptoms-

166
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,092
his confused sense of direction,
running right into the policeman...

167
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:47,304
the changes in his optic disks,
his increased spinal fluid.

168
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:50,724
Brooks, I'm not ruling out
your diagnosis of brain tumour.

169
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:54,477
- I'm merely indicating other possibilities.
- What other possibilities?

170
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:57,314
Well, there isn't too much you can
determine from the outside of a cadaver.

171
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,774
There is a possibility
that I killed him, isn't there?

172
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:02,861
- Don't be a fool.
- That I was careless in the spinal tap.

173
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,155
That his brother's
Negro-baiting got me down.

174
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,824
I don't wanna ever hear you say
anything like that again.

175
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,619
You're a capable doctor.
You were the doctor in charge.

176
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,038
You did what you thought right,
and there's an end to it.

177
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,500
Dr. Wharton.

178
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,086
What would you have done?

179
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,632
- Probably exactly what you did.
- But you don't agree he had a brain tumour.

180
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:26,676
Well, not to the exclusion
of other possibilities. How can I?

181
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,012
A man was shot in the leg.
He bled freely.

182
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,349
He ran. He fought with the policeman.
He was forcibly overcome.

183
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,935
When you first saw him,
he was gasping for breath in shock.

184
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,937
Yeah, a possible blood clot
to the lung.

185
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,522
A possibility.
There are a half dozen more.

186
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:41,524
Is there anything else
I should have done?

187
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,653
It still depends upon
what was the matter with him.

188
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,905
- And when they go out that fast-
- No, I was right.

189
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,992
I know I was right. I've got to prove it.
I want an autopsy.

190
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:53,078
And you're entitled to it.

191
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,206
Unfortunately, this is one state
which does not insist on an autopsy...

192
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,208
in all cases of traumatic death.

193
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,044
We can't do a thing
without permission of the family.

194
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,922
It's the family
I've got to convince.

195
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,216
- The brother?
- No.

196
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,177
He called me a murderer.
Said I murdered his brother in cold blood.

197
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,222
Every time anybody dies in a county hospital,
somebody yells murder.

198
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:15,350
- But it's not the same when they yell it at me.
- It's got to be. You're a doctor.

199
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,728
They're not yelling at the doctor.
They're yelling at the nigger.

200
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,730
I've got to have that autopsy.

201
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:28,655
- Who's that man?
- I don't know.

202
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,496
- Who is that man?
- Him?

203
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,374
He's another brother, George Biddle.
He's deaf and dumb.

204
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,377
- He come up about five minutes ago.
- What's he doing here?

205
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,879
Well, he asked downstairs about his brothers
and they sent him up.

206
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,549
I let him stick around.
He wanted to claim the body...

207
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,551
in case you said
it was okay to release it.

208
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,594
Well, it's not okay.
Get him outta here.

209
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,559
Louie, get the dummy out.

210
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,122
I'm Dr. Wharton,
chief medical resident of this hospital.

211
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,791
- Hi, Doc.
- Your brother had no right to be here.

212
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,544
Communication with prisoners is forbidden
except by direct permission.

213
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,796
Oh, I'm sure George
didn't mean no harm.

214
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,174
He's just a poor
deaf and dumb guy.

215
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,301
Well, he's kind of
broken up about Johnny.

216
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,595
Him and Johnny
was always very close.

217
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:37,390
That's what he was telling me, Doc,
how he misses Johnny...

218
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,392
now that Johnny's gone.

219
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,397
I understand you created quite a rumpus
when Dr. Brooks was doing his best...

220
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,399
to save your brother's life.

221
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:49,152
If you give us any more trouble,
you'll be put under restraint. Is that clear?

222
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,154
- Yeah, Doc.
- Dr. Brooks is in charge here...

223
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,491
- and you're expected to cooperate with him.
- Whatever you say.

224
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,659
Now, uh, about your brother.

225
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:59,496
He was undoubtedly dying
as he entered this hospital.

226
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,498
I don't think anything
could have prevented his death.

227
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,834
Well, he was shot in the leg, wasn't he, Doc?
Same as me.

228
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,629
The gunshot was probably
not the cause of his death.

229
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,798
Uh-huh. Well,
I was only wondering...

230
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:12,509
'cause if it was,
then why ain't I dead too?

231
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,803
Your brother was a sick man.

232
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,846
Johnny?

233
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,351
In order to determine
the exact extent of that illness...

234
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:24,104
we'd, uh, like permission
to perform an autopsy.

235
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,232
You mean out him up?
Cut Johnny up?

236
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,442
That is the only way
we can determine the exact cause...

237
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,736
- No, he's had enough.
- But if there's any doubt in your own mind.

238
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,280
No, he's dead.
Leave him alone.

239
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:42,205
I'll talk to the chief
in the morning.

240
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,541
He might ask the coroner
to requisition the autopsy.

241
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,918
- Thank you.
- Good night.

242
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:55,176
Dr. Brooks.

243
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,971
Would you come here a minute?

244
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,317
My brother George is quite a guy.

245
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,695
He's a dummy,
but he's got eyes like an eagle.

246
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,697
He can read lips a block away.

247
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,408
He can read what people
are thinking almost.

248
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,079
And you got big, fat lips.

249
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,081
You're a pushover for George.

250
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:29,043
- Well?
- Wanna know what he really told me, huh?

251
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:32,213
He told me everything
you and your boss talked about.

252
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:35,175
How he wasn't sure at all
you did the right thing to Johnny.

253
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,177
How maybe he thinks
you did the wrong thing.

254
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,055
How he doesn't care whether you murdered
my brother or not. Just forget it.

255
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,603
But you ain't gonna
forget it, Rastus.

256
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,605
I did the right thing.
An autopsy will prove it.

257
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,274
Ain't gonna be no autopsy, not on Johnny.
His pals wouldn't like it.

258
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,776
Beaver Canal,
it's full of Johnny's pals.

259
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:56,446
And wait till they find out
how he got killed...

260
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,656
and by what.

261
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,701
Yeah, I'd sure hate to be living
in nigger town these days.

262
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:05,622
You live in nigger town?
Sure you do. Where else?

263
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:09,459
And don't worry about the autopsy.
Yours, I mean.

264
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,795
You're gonna be wide open
when they find you.

265
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:22,305
Dr. Thomas wanted in Surgery.

266
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,641
- Dr. Thomas wanted in Surgery.
- Good morning.

267
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,643
Go right in, Dr. Wharton.

268
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:31,064
Good morning, Sam.

269
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,358
What's been dropped out
of our budget this time?

270
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:37,487
I wish my job was as funny
as you seem to think it is, Dan.

271
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,489
Have you seen the morning papers?

272
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,825
Well, I thought I did. I must have
missed something pretty important.

273
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,495
Oh, just a little item
on a back page.

274
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,624
"Policeman battles gunman in rain.

275
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:53,044
Policeman Edward Kowalski last night
surprised two alleged holdup men"...

276
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,046
et cetera, et cetera.

277
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,048
"One of the brothers, John Biddle...

278
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,801
suffering from a superficial
wound in the leg...

279
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:03,596
died shortly after his arrival
at the county hospital.

280
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,350
The cause of his death
was not revealed."

281
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,352
Why not?

282
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:12,647
Well, I imagine because the death certificate
wasn't filed in time for the story.

283
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,691
Well, what caused the delay?

284
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,902
The doctor in charge wanted me
to corroborate his findings.

285
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,822
Well, did you agree with him?

286
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:24,242
I was satisfied that he'd done
what he thought was best.

287
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:28,496
- Doctor in charge was Luther Brooks.
- Dr. Brooks was in charge.

288
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,708
Dan, this is one of those things that I
wake up at night in a cold sweat about.

289
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,710
A gram and a half of Seconal -

290
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,712
The cause of death
was not revealed.

291
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:39,507
They'll follow it up, ask questions,
imply this, imply that.

292
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,260
First thing you know, they'll whip it up
into one of those hush-hush things...

293
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:44,595
- demanding investigations.
- Selling papers.

294
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:47,974
- Creating opinion.
- Sam, an unimportant item on a back page.

295
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:52,520
You know what can become
of an unimportant lump under the skin.

296
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:55,690
Let's hope it stays that way.

297
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:59,861
Fortunately, there was no mention of Brooke's
name or the fact that he was a Negro.

298
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:03,239
- And what if there were?
- Don't be childish.

299
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,408
Does the fact
that Luther Brooks is a Negro...

300
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:08,036
affect his responsibility
toward this hospital?

301
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,872
- Or our responsibility toward him?
- Now wait a minute.

302
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:14,500
Don't go reading any anti-Negro implications
into what I say.

303
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:17,837
I accepted Brooks here as an intern,
and I'm all for him.

304
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,423
Next year I'd like
another Negro intern.

305
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,051
Maybe two.
Why, if anything, I'm pro-Negro.

306
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,848
I'm not. I'm pro-good doctor -
black, white or polka dot.

307
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,809
As chief resident, I have no more right
to wax sentimental

308
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:34,854
over a bad doctor
because he happens to be a Negro

309
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,106
than I have to discriminate
against a good doctor

310
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,735
because he's white, Protestant
and independently wealthy.

311
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:43,237
A very commendable
scientific attitude.

312
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:45,365
- It's the only scientific attitude.
- No, it's not.

313
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:50,703
But you can afford it because you live in that
vacuum across the hall you call your office.

314
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:53,956
You've got on a white coat.
I haven't.

315
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,834
Public funds, public service.

316
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,961
You think one is the direct result
of the other...

317
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,963
like an intravenous injection?

318
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:04,926
You think all I have to do is to pick up that
phone and say send another million dollars?

319
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,720
You think schools
are run by educators?

320
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:10,640
Do you think the police department
is run by criminologists?

321
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:14,894
Do you think the board of supervisors
consider your serological lab equipment...

322
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:17,563
more important than
getting themselves reelected?

323
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:21,651
Why, it took me three months of wheedling,
begging and compromising...

324
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:24,278
to get you
two hydrotherapy units.

325
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:30,201
For the same amount of money, the mayor
could have bought 300 birdbaths...

326
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,662
with his name
on each one of them.

327
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:36,999
Hold on to that white coat, Dan.
Don't change it for one like mine.

328
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,460
Sam Moreland, M.D.

329
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:42,004
Means something different now.

330
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:44,465
Means master of double-talk.

331
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:50,012
Let's hope that this
doesn't start something.

332
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:54,684
You've got a couple of important appropriations
coming up against strong opposition.

333
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,853
And the difference
between winning and losing...

334
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,855
can be the fact
that Brooks is a Negro.

335
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,652
Brooks wants you
to authorise an autopsy.

336
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:07,697
There's a brother in custody, isn't there?
Get his permission.

337
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,033
He won't give it. He claims Brooks
deliberately murdered his brother.

338
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:14,495
The orderlies tell me he's as vicious
a Negro hater as they've ever seen...

339
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:16,956
on the verge
of being psychotic about it.

340
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,043
Brooks is pretty upset. He feels
that an autopsy will justify his diagnosis...

341
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:23,379
- even to this hoodlum.
- Hmm.

342
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:27,592
In your official capacity,
have you any reason for dissatisfaction...

343
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:29,719
with the manner in which Brooks
handled the case?

344
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,889
- No.
- Then in my official capacity,

345
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:36,225
I feel that the welfare of the institution
would be best served

346
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,104
by forgetting the incident
as quickly as possible.

347
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:44,859
Tell Brooks how much I regret the
necessity of rejecting his request.

348
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:46,861
Right.

349
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:49,155
Oh, Dan.

350
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:52,492
You've transferred Brooks
from duty in the prison ward of course.

351
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:54,869
No, I haven't.
In my official capacity,

352
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:58,080
I found no reason
for transferring him.

353
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:01,250
As a matter of fact, he should just
about have finished removing the bullet

354
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,377
from Ray Biddle's leg.

355
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:23,231
So, that's the slug
that gave me the business, huh?

356
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:45,211
When that procaine wears off. you may have
some pain. We'll give you something for it.

357
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,755
- I can take it.
- Stay off that leg as much as you can.

358
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,757
Can't afford to lose
much more blood.

359
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,969
You're gonna come in and look it over
every now and then, ain't ya, Doc?

360
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:01,936
Doctor, there's a scalpel missing.
There are only two here.

361
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,605
- You sure you had three?
- Very sure.

362
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:06,732
I can't understand it.

363
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,985
It must be here somewhere.

364
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:12,822
Just keep looking.
We'll find it.

365
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:23,040
A scalpel of all things. We just can't have
one loose in the prison ward, Doctor.

366
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:31,549
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

367
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:34,760
- The scalpel. You took it.
- I wouldn't know a scalpel from a stomach pump.

368
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:35,845
You're outta your mind.

369
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,264
It was lying right next to you.
You had plenty of chances.

370
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:41,517
You took it. You've got it on you now.
Give it back.

371
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:44,979
Eh, take it easy. Nurse, can't you
get him an aspirin or something?

372
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:52,528
Orderly. Sheriff.

373
00:26:58,326 --> 00:27:00,620
You're not leaving this room
till they find that scalpel.

374
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:03,289
You sure you've got enough help?
How about the fire department?

375
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,291
- What is it, Dr. Brooks?
- This man has stolen a scalpel.

376
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,293
He's got it hidden on him.
I want him searched.

377
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,920
- Hand it over, Biddle.
- I ain't got it, Doc.

378
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:12,548
- You sure there's one missing?
- I checked all three, Dr. Wharton.

379
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:15,217
- We've only found two.
- He's had every opportunity to take it.

380
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,219
Miss Blake and I had our backs to him
most of the time.

381
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:19,555
The scalpels were lying right here
on the instrument table

382
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:21,557
and all he had to do was...

383
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,445
Glad you didn't search me.

384
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:38,115
I was afraid maybe he'd slipped it
under my sheet or something.

385
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,326
Take him back to his room.

386
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:48,125
Nobody would have believed me.
Who'd take my word around here

387
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,753
against the word of a... doctor?

388
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:01,931
I don't know how
it got into my pocket.

389
00:28:02,056 --> 00:28:04,058
Well, it's been along, hard night.

390
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:06,185
You think I'm imagining things.

391
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:10,690
I think you're exaggerating the importance
of a pathological Negro hater.

392
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:13,567
His kind hasn't been important to me
since I was a kid.

393
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:17,655
I've got a thick black skin by now, but
this one thinks I've murdered his brother.

394
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,907
Well, let him. You know you didn't.
You couldn't have.

395
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,452
- You removed less than 10 drops of fluid.
- But he's got to know that.

396
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:26,872
Dr. Wharton, there are Negroes
who are pathological white haters.

397
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:30,876
If I were white and one of them thought
I'd murdered his brother, I'd be afraid too.

398
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,003
I've got to have that autopsy.

399
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:35,881
It's occurred to you, hasn't it,
that the autopsy could show you were wrong.

400
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:38,217
- What chance would you say?
- Maybe 50-50.

401
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,219
Without it, I'm all wrong.

402
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:44,140
- Moreland won't authorise one without consent of the family.
- Why not?

403
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:47,101
He thinks it contrary
to the best interests of the hospital.

404
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:56,652
The, uh, police record shows
the existence of another close relative.

405
00:28:56,736 --> 00:29:00,489
- Another brother?
- No, a wife. The dead man's wife.

406
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:03,325
Last time he was booked,
he listed her as nearest of kin.

407
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,953
- A Mrs. Edith Biddle.
- Where can I call her?

408
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:08,164
- Is there a phone number?
- No, only an address.

409
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:11,167
They had quite a time finding it.
Seems she moves about quite a bit.

410
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:15,421
Right now it's -
it's 351 Front Street.

411
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:18,674
- Wanna come along?
- Oh, but aren't you on duty?

412
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:21,677
By now, as far as I'm concerned,
you're a case.

413
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:43,407
I take clothes. Any old clothes.

414
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:46,619
I take clothes. I take.

415
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:49,830
I take. I take clothes.

416
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:58,172
- Ruby!
- What do you want?

417
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:02,218
Stick your head in the dumbwaiter.
I don't wanna yell so loud.

418
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:06,263
...sauce. Ten minutes before serving time,

419
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:10,267
cook the spaghetti
in a large pot of boiling water

420
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:13,062
with one tablespoon of salt.

421
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:16,982
- Cook it uncovered for...
- Who is it?

422
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,360
My name's Dr. Wharton.
I'd like to talk to you.

423
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:22,196
Whatever you're sellin',
I don't want any. I feel fine.

424
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,323
I'm not selling anything
This is important.

425
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:27,326
Ain't it always?
Some other time, buster.

426
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:30,162
Mrs. Biddle, if you'd just
let me explain.

427
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:33,707
- Who'd you say?
- Aren't you Mrs. John Biddle?

428
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:39,088
Nobody by that name lives here.

429
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:44,051
Maybe you'd rather straighten that out
with the police.

430
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,053
What's it to them?

431
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,433
Stop being silly.
Open the door.

432
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:28,929
All right, so what, Dr. Wharton?

433
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:31,640
- What makes you think I'm Dr. Wharton?
- Aren't you?

434
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:35,185
- He might be.
- Let's not clown.

435
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:39,398
This is Dr. Brooks.
He tried to save your husband's life.

436
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,859
You mean, Johnny died
in a coloured hospital?

437
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:44,945
Dr. Brooks is on my staff
at the county hospital.

438
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:47,114
He couldn't have had
a better doctor.

439
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:54,496
Anybody want a coffee cake,
it's on the table.

440
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,999
- Maybe some coffee.
- No, thanks.

441
00:31:57,082 --> 00:32:00,419
Still fresh.
I pick 'em up late at night with the papers.

442
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:03,923
Saves getting up in the morning.

443
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:07,301
We want you to know
how sorry we are, Mrs. Biddle.

444
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:10,054
- We realise this is no time...
- The name's Johnson.

445
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:12,056
- Edie Johnson.
- Since when?

446
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:15,351
Since I divorced Johnny Biddle
a year and a half ago.

447
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:20,189
It's nice of you to drop around
and tell me you're sorry,

448
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:22,358
only I'm not interested.

449
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:26,904
I'll tell you something else. If you came by
to say the whole Biddle family was dying,

450
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:29,740
and this cigarette butt
was the only thing that could save them...

451
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,953
- Legally divorced?
- Wanna see the papers?

452
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:36,497
Thanks just the same.

453
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,499
Well, I guess that's all, huh?

454
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,542
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

455
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:44,797
It's too bad. We came here because
we thought you could help us.

456
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,342
- What's there to help?
- We wanted to examine your ex-husband's body...

457
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:51,553
to make sure he died
from the causes we think he did.

458
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:53,555
We're not permitted to
without permission of the family.

459
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:55,557
- Well, what about Johnny's brothers?
- They won't allow it.

460
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:57,643
- For cash they will.
- I'm afraid not.

461
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:00,187
For two bits
they'd sell his eyeballs.

462
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,398
You're fond of them.
I can see that.

463
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,400
They're lovable.

464
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:07,069
And now Eddie Miller's new recording of

465
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:09,113
"In a Sentimental Mood."

466
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:14,159
I don't know why they
bother opening the doors.

467
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:17,121
With these walls, I know just who brushes
their teeth and who don't.

468
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:21,250
Well, goodbye.
Thanks just the same.

469
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:26,797
Uh, Dr. Wharton.
Um, Ray, the brother that was with Johnny...

470
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:29,091
is - is Ray gonna die too?

471
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,343
He's gonna be all right. Why?

472
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:33,429
Nothing. Just come to my mind.

473
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:36,098
Ray Biddle thinks
I killed his brother deliberately.

474
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,142
We want the autopsy
to prove that I didn't...

475
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:40,436
- that he died of natural causes.
- So?

476
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:43,230
Perhaps if you could talk to him.

477
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:54,700
- How well do you know Ray Biddle?
- Well enough. Why?

478
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,619
- You seem concerned about him.
- Because I asked how he was?

479
00:33:57,745 --> 00:33:59,913
You'd ask that
about a sick alley cat.

480
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:03,000
When you were married to his brother,
did you see much of him?

481
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,002
- He lived with us.
- Beaver Canal?

482
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:07,921
- Where else?
- Where did you live before you got married?

483
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:10,632
Where else?
Next door to the Biddies, all my life.

484
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:14,136
My folks and their folks
got loaded together every Saturday night.

485
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,930
- Must have been fun for you kids.
- A million laughs.

486
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:20,059
- Just like having three brothers, huh?
- Just like it.

487
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:22,478
Look, if you don't mind,
I gotta get dressed now.

488
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,563
- Are you going to work?
- I work nights.

489
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,900
- At what?
- I'm a carhop in a drive-in. Anything wrong with that?

490
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:30,319
- No, nothing at all.
- It's none of your business what I do.

491
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,905
It's a respectable job,
and I pay my own way.

492
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:35,074
And you're not living
in Beaver Canal anymore.

493
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:38,077
Yeah, I've come up in the world.

494
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,496
I used to live in a sewer.
Now I live in a swamp.

495
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,664
How do those babes
do it in the movies?

496
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:44,666
By now I oughta be married
to the governor

497
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,669
and paying blackmail so he don't
find out I once lived in Beaver Canal.

498
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:51,423
- The point is you got out.
- Five blocks away.

499
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:54,134
Five million blocks -
what's the difference?

500
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:56,512
You hate Beaver Canal.
You hate what it stands for.

501
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,264
You talk like I was a poet
or a professor.

502
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:02,309
I found an open manhole, and I crawled out
of a sewer. Wouldn't anybody?

503
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,311
Ray Biddle wouldn't.

504
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:06,855
He likes Beaver Canal.
He likes what it stands for.

505
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,942
I don't even know
what that means, "stands for."

506
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,694
There's no difference in people
except the size of the tips.

507
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,864
A drunk's a drunk and a pass is a pass
if it's a Ford or a Cadillac.

508
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,408
- Let's stick to Beaver Canal and Ray Biddle.
- You stick to him.

509
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:21,662
- Dr. Brooks asked you a question.
- That was 50 questions ago.

510
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:24,706
Beaver Canal hates Negroes,
and so does Ray Biddle.

511
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:28,418
His only reason for refusing the autopsy
is because Dr. Brooks is a Negro...

512
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:31,130
and he wants to think
that he murdered his brother.

513
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:33,674
There's no difference
in people, you say.

514
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,676
Will you help us?
Will you talk to him?

515
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:38,887
An autopsy will give me the chance
I need to prove I didn't kill his brother.

516
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:42,099
I don't want any part of it.

517
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:44,226
Why not?

518
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,645
And I don't wanna talk about it.

519
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:56,155
Coming?

520
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:08,227
You sure you won't have
some coffee with me?

521
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,229
Thanks just the same.

522
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:11,813
There's no sense getting
into a depression about this.

523
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,273
I'm not.

524
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:15,484
A cup of coffee
and some talk might help.

525
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:17,486
There isn't much left to talk about.

526
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,655
And there'll be coffee waiting for me.
There always is.

527
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,657
Well, then how about
asking me in for some?

528
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,284
I'd rather not worry Cora
or the rest about what happened.

529
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:26,245
I want you to stop worrying too.

530
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:31,416
Am I to go back
on Prison Ward tonight?

531
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,753
- Of course.
- Thanks for all your trouble.

532
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,361
- Hi.
- Hi.

533
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,989
- Where's Cora?
- Market.

534
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:05,826
Hi.

535
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:08,745
- You're late.
- Something came up.

536
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:12,708
- How's the leg, Sis?
- Okay. But the job's gone. They couldn't wait.

537
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,710
Well, standing on it
isn't the best thing.

538
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:17,796
Somebody's gotta wash my husband's shirts.
Out of work six months

539
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:20,966
and from his shirts you'd think
he was digging a tunnel under the river.

540
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,343
That six months will pay off
when he gets to be a mailman.

541
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:25,762
Sure is a great house
for studying books.

542
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,140
Plenty of books coming in the door,
but no money.

543
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:31,560
- The money will come along in time.
- I wanna see it.

544
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,895
- How long has Cora been gone?
- Oughta be here by now.

545
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:36,690
- She's picking up some whipping cream.
- Whipping cream? What for?

546
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:39,234
It'll go good on this apple cake.

547
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,236
- Is it somebody's birthday?
- Never you mind.

548
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,405
- It's a surprise.
- For whom?

549
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,074
- Never you mind.
- For me.

550
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:48,577
- Hey, what is it?
- You'll know when it's time.

551
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:50,871
- Go get some sleep.
- I won't sleep.

552
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:53,290
Beat it.

553
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,259
I think it's silly
going to all that fuss -

554
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:06,261
apple cake, whipped cream.

555
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:09,181
It don't hurt none to put on the dog.
Makes a good impression.

556
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,266
That depends on whom
you're tying to impress.

557
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,352
Old Dr. Clark, he lives high.

558
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:15,937
Show him you live high, and he'll think high
when it comes to paying money.

559
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:17,939
Dr. Clark. So that's it.

560
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:20,442
Ain't that just what
we've been talking about?

561
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,527
- I'm going to sleep.
- Hey, Luth.

562
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:25,489
- What's the capital of South Dakota?
- Who knows?

563
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:27,949
Boy, you couldn't get
to be a mailman.

564
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:32,287
Sure, maybe you could deliver babies all
right, but you couldn't deliver no letters.

565
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,793
- Luther home yet?
- Just went to bed.

566
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,795
Take these in for me, will you?

567
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,005
He didn't know the capital of South Dakota.
You know what I said?

568
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,466
"Boy;' I said," maybe you can deliver
them babies;' I said...

569
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:46,468
"but you sure can't deliver no letters."

570
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,975
- Hello, honey.
- I've been worried. Where have you been?

571
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,770
I waited as long as I could
to have breakfast with you.

572
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,814
Dr. Wharton and I
had to go on an errand.

573
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:01,983
- What kind of an errand?
- Hospital business.

574
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:04,444
You ought to have more than coffee.
Let me fix you some eggs?

575
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:08,281
Mm, this is fine.
Just stay here and talk for a minute.

576
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:14,663
You and Dr. Wharton,
you get along fine, don't you?

577
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,790
There's never been anyone
like him in my life.

578
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,834
He must be a wonderful man...

579
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,836
and I'm sure
he's taught you a lot...

580
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,963
but you're pretty
wonderful yourself.

581
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:26,007
Yeah, a second
Dr. George Washington Carver.

582
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:29,636
- And why not?
- So many reasons, Cora.

583
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,638
One, I'm not even
a good intern yet.

584
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:35,225
Dr. Clark says your record's one of
the best the county hospital's ever had.

585
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:39,354
That, plus Mom's apple cake with whipped
cream oughta get me a pretty good job,

586
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:41,773
- shouldn't it?
- Let's not talk about it now.

587
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:44,192
I wish I'd been consulted
about his coming.

588
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:48,363
Keep it as a surprise.
You do that with kids. It's kinda childish.

589
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:50,782
Well, it was really his idea.

590
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:53,034
I need another year with Wharton.

591
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:56,705
Not now.
Let's not talk about it now.

592
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:59,833
I'm not sure of myself
in so many ways, Cora.

593
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:02,210
Not now.

594
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:05,380
Clark and his big, fat practice.

595
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:08,383
I'd never know whether
I was a good doctor.

596
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:10,469
Get some sleep, honey.

597
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:16,183
You're so tired.

598
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:18,185
You've worked so hard.

599
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:20,729
Harder than anybody
to get where you are.

600
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,857
The shoes you shined,
the dishes you washed.

601
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,859
The garbage you dumped.

602
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:29,738
The food you couldn't buy
because you needed books, remember?

603
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:34,159
How you studied.
How I'd ask you questions over and over.

604
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,786
Questions I couldn't
even pronounce.

605
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:39,748
Coffee, coffee and more coffee.

606
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,501
Slapping you to keep you awake.

607
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:46,087
And when you told me
"A" was your passing mark...

608
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:51,635
not for the others, just for you.

609
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,721
You got 'em, all A's.

610
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,266
No wonder you're tired.

611
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,436
Even I'm a little tired.

612
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:04,773
Cleaning up after parties,
eating leftovers.

613
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:08,610
One day off a week
to be with my husband.

614
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,446
Be a woman.

615
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:13,448
Beloved.

616
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:17,953
We've been a long time getting here.

617
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:20,539
We're tired, but we're here, honey.

618
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:26,378
We can be happy.
We've got a right to be.

619
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:49,359
- Looking for somebody?
- Uh, yes, my husband, Ray Biddle.

620
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:52,487
- I couldn't get here till just now.
- This ain't visiting hours.

621
00:42:52,571 --> 00:42:55,156
Well, you see, sir,
I can't come anytime I want.

622
00:42:55,282 --> 00:42:57,993
I just took an hour off from work,
and it's way on the other side of town.

623
00:42:58,118 --> 00:43:00,495
And, well, tomorrow
the boss says I can't come.

624
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,582
- Where's your pass?
- A pass? Just to see my husband?

625
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:05,584
Go get a pass and come back.

626
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:08,128
- Dr. Wharton didn't say anything about a pass.
- Wharton?

627
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:11,089
Yeah, he said for me to come up here.
He's the one told me where to go.

628
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:13,091
It's funny he didn't
give you a pass.

629
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:15,093
Yeah, ain't it?
Well, I guess he would have,

630
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:18,638
only I was in such a hurry,
and he was too, going someplace.

631
00:43:18,722 --> 00:43:23,685
Wait a minute.
He gave me this. Is that any good?

632
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,688
- It's a visiting card.
- Maybe he thought that would be enough.

633
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:29,190
- Visiting card ain't no pass.
- Look, buster, I didn't print it up.

634
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:31,776
- The man gave it to me.
- I'll see if I can get him on the phone.

635
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,778
- Oh, forget it.
- It's no trouble.

636
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:36,823
Forget it. Next thing you'll be wanting
fingerprints and a blood test.

637
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:39,451
Life's too short.
Go file a big, fat report

638
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:41,453
on how you kept me
from breaking in your jail here.

639
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:44,039
And tell my husband
I'll try to come back again sometime

640
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:47,167
and I'll tell Dr. Wharton
what a fine figure of a cop he's got up here.

641
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,544
- Wharton ain't my boss.
- Lucky for you.

642
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:51,546
If he was, you'd be out in the rain.

643
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:54,507
Wait a minute.

644
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:56,801
I guess it's okay.

645
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:06,186
Let me see your pocketbook.

646
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:12,901
- Okay.
- Maybe you'd like to search me?

647
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:15,904
Some other time.
Straight ahead, Room 5.

648
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:54,067
Why couldn't it have been you
that got killed instead of Johnny?

649
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,486
That's your favourite question,
ain't it?

650
00:44:56,611 --> 00:45:00,115
Only the last time you asked it,
it wasn't about being dead.

651
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,367
You scum.

652
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:06,454
It was, "Why couldn't it be you
I'm married to instead of Johnny?"

653
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,707
You dirty scum.

654
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:12,293
- Sounded good in the dark.
- I should have killed you.

655
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:14,963
You had other things
on your mind.

656
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:17,424
You weren't fit to live
in the same world with him.

657
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:20,301
I don't see no tears on your face.
Where's your black dress?

658
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:22,303
If it was you,
I'd sing and wear flowers.

659
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:24,973
All right, Edie, what's on your mind?
What do you want?

660
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:29,602
They tell me you ain't hurt so bad.

661
00:45:29,686 --> 00:45:31,646
I've lost a lot of blood.

662
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:34,774
That's a shame.

663
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:36,776
Gimme a cigarette.

664
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:42,323
Matches.

665
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:50,373
Tell me something.
Who's "they"?

666
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:53,126
- The head doctor, Wharton.
- Did you go to see him?

667
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:57,505
He came to see me.
He and the-Dr. Brooks.

668
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,134
Well, now that was real nice.
They don't always do that.

669
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:04,471
Why won't you let them
examine Johnny's body?

670
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:08,349
Ah, so that's why
you're here, huh?

671
00:46:09,726 --> 00:46:11,853
Well, why won't you let 'em?

672
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:17,692
Let me give you a light.

673
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:21,654
No. It's all right.

674
00:46:21,738 --> 00:46:23,823
Come over here.

675
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:35,794
- Let me go.
- What are you scared of?

676
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:38,171
I can't move.
There's cops all around.

677
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:41,257
After all this time,
you won't even sit for a minute.

678
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:45,261
Now that's better.

679
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,263
- Edie, listen to me.
- I've done too much of that already.

680
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:49,682
What we did to Johnny, we did together.
He didn't know it. It didn't hurt him.

681
00:46:49,766 --> 00:46:52,310
- I know. I'll always know.
- Then how are you gonna make it up to him?

682
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:55,563
You know what they do, Edie,
when they examine a dead body?

683
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:57,607
They out it in pieces.

684
00:46:57,732 --> 00:47:00,401
Th-They chop it up
like it was a hunk of wood.

685
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:08,368
The way you feel about Johnny, I guess
maybe you think he's got it coming to him.

686
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:11,496
- Johnny was a good kid.
- Yeah, that's why I was wondering.

687
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:16,501
Johnny's body,
the body you used to love.

688
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:18,628
They say it's on account of you
they gotta have the autopsy

689
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:20,755
'cause you think he was killed,
and they wanna prove you wrong.

690
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,882
Because that nigger doctor
murdered Johnny.

691
00:47:22,966 --> 00:47:27,262
It's the truth. I swear it.
I seen it with my own eyes.

692
00:47:27,387 --> 00:47:29,889
Edie, sit down.
Please, sit down.

693
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:33,893
Look, I'm on the level.
What's in it for me not to be?

694
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:37,897
Why wouldn't I believe them?
Unless I knew better.

695
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:40,942
They say you wanna think the way you do
because Dr. Brooks is coloured.

696
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:43,695
Yeah, sure, I know.
I'm supposed to forget it.

697
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,406
I'm supposed to forget my brother
couldn't have a white doctor...

698
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:48,408
forget he'd be alive if he did.

699
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:50,410
Edie, I wanna ask you something.

700
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:53,329
If you had a kid,
would you send him to a nigger doctor?

701
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:56,791
Would you like one putting
his dirty black hands on you?

702
00:47:56,916 --> 00:48:00,128
Would you like to be lying here
like me watching Johnny in that bed,

703
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:03,798
shot in the leg, watching a nigger doctor
jab a needle into his back?

704
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:05,800
Watching Johnny die?

705
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:10,680
If you're so sure,
what are you afraid of?

706
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:12,724
- Give him a chance to prove it.
- No.

707
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:15,184
'Cause they won't be lookin'
for anything they don't know.

708
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,478
They wanna fix it
so nobody ever knows the truth.

709
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:26,446
I don't know what to believe.

710
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:29,824
Yeah, it certainly don't figure
you're gonna believe me.

711
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:32,785
Why should you?
When have I ever levelled with you?

712
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:36,998
- Never.
- When I do, I get kissed off. It figures. What else?

713
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:40,960
Ray Biddle out of Beaver Canal.

714
00:48:41,044 --> 00:48:43,171
What was it you used to call us?

715
00:48:43,296 --> 00:48:47,550
Human garbage.
We stink up the street.

716
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:50,303
Where do I stack up
against the great Dr. Wharton?

717
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:53,681
But when the head doctor of the hospital
comes to see me himself...

718
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,683
to explain
and to ask me for help-

719
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:57,894
Be smart, Edie.
Why would he come?

720
00:48:58,019 --> 00:49:00,980
'Cause he's on a spot.
He wants an out, a patsy.

721
00:49:01,064 --> 00:49:03,483
Dr. Wharton coming after you
with his hat in his hand.

722
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:06,611
Do you think that's his job?
And who did he come begging to?

723
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:09,072
To Mrs. John Biddle
of the county club?

724
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:13,701
No, to Edie Johnson, another hunk of garbage
out of Beaver Canal.

725
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:15,703
Yeah, like me, like Johnny.

726
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:19,040
Somebody he can double-talk
and push around, play for a sucker.

727
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:22,794
He didn't treat me like Beaver Canal.
He knows I don't want any part of it.

728
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:25,880
- How does he know?
- I told him.

729
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:28,883
And he gave you a great big hand, didn't he?
Made you feel great.

730
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:32,387
Like you were a nice, clean girl
in a nice, clean world.

731
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:36,015
The head of a big institution comes
all the way across town just for that.

732
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:39,310
Just to tell you
how far away Beaver Canal is.

733
00:49:39,394 --> 00:49:41,938
Just to play you for a chump.

734
00:49:46,526 --> 00:49:48,403
It's funny.

735
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:50,571
What is?

736
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:54,033
Almost the last thing
Johnny was saying yesterday.

737
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:58,079
I can hardly believe
it was only yesterday.

738
00:49:58,204 --> 00:50:00,748
- What?
- It ain't important.

739
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:03,001
What?

740
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:05,586
Just that he might have
been you talking.

741
00:50:05,712 --> 00:50:08,589
He talked about getting out
of Beaver Canal...

742
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:11,009
and making something
out of himself.

743
00:50:11,092 --> 00:50:14,637
How you were right all along,
and he was wrong.

744
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:17,265
He was gonna come
and tell you about it...

745
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:20,018
today.

746
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:22,061
He's better off.

747
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:24,605
Now he don't have to know
that you don't get out...

748
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:26,774
because it never gets
outta you.

749
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:28,776
The stink gets in your skin.

750
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:32,447
- Oh, they can smell you a mile off.
- Don't talk like that, Edie.

751
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:35,825
Didn't that doctor tell you
you were doing fine?

752
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:41,205
Yeah, he had me going good.
He had me all set to marry the governor.

753
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:46,586
- Well, what do we do about it?
- About what?

754
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:48,379
Johnny.
About the nigger doctor.

755
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,636
Come here.

756
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:04,020
First thing, you go find George.
You can talk dummy language.

757
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:06,022
He'll tell you everything
you have to know.

758
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:08,274
Make him take you to the club.
Spill it all to Rocky Miller.

759
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:10,443
Tell Rocky what
they tried to pull on you.

760
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:12,904
And then do
what Rocky tells you.

761
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:15,156
It makes sense they killed Johnny
and they're trying to cover.

762
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:18,284
- What else?
- It makes sense that-

763
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:20,620
They wouldn't come to me
unless they needed something bad enough.

764
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,622
A chump.

765
00:51:24,624 --> 00:51:26,501
I'm the type.

766
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:35,009
This way we can make it up
a little to Johnny.

767
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:39,597
You're a good kid too, Edie.

768
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:44,644
The cream off the top
of the bottle. That's me.

769
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:00,993
Autopsy, my eye.
They wanna cut him up.

770
00:52:01,077 --> 00:52:03,788
- Cut 'im up so nobody will ever know.
- Dirty, stinkin' dinge.

771
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:06,249
- You said that before.
- I'll say it again.

772
00:52:06,374 --> 00:52:09,585
That helps a lot.
That helps Johnny a lot.

773
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:12,338
Is that how Ray told it to you?

774
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:14,340
Edie.

775
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:16,634
It ain't right to out him up.

776
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:19,846
Cut him up like-like
he was a hunk of wood.

777
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:21,848
They even sent her
to talk Ray into it.

778
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:24,433
Well, they-they didn't
just put it like that.

779
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:27,854
But that's what they want, ain't it,
to cut him up?

780
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:31,899
Answer the man.

781
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:34,110
Yeah, that's what they wanted.

782
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:36,237
That's what gets me,
the way they butter up them jigs.

783
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,657
What are you gonna do about it, cry?
The dummy threw a rock at least.

784
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,909
They kill his brother, and he throws a rook
through a window. Big hero.

785
00:52:41,993 --> 00:52:45,913
- He's only a dummy.
- And what are you? What are you gonna throw, Mac?

786
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:47,999
Who's next? That's what I wanna know?
Who's next?

787
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:51,294
I saw a boogie the other day in a oar
a block long. Like he owned the world.

788
00:52:51,419 --> 00:52:53,754
The city hospital, we pay for it,
for niggers killing white men.

789
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,465
- What are we gonna do about it?
- We could all wind up like Johnny.

790
00:52:56,591 --> 00:52:58,509
- Well?
- When?

791
00:52:58,593 --> 00:53:00,553
- Tonight. How many, Whitey?
- It's after 6:00 now.

792
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,972
It's kinda late.
Maybe I can hustle up a dozen.

793
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:05,183
Hustle hard. Tell 'em about Johnny.
Make it two dozen.

794
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:08,519
- What time?
- 9:00 at Andy's junkyard. Andy knows about it.

795
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:18,571
- What about you, Rocky?
- We'll all be there.

796
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:20,573
- Johnny belonged with us, didn't he?
- Yeah.

797
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:21,949
- What about you?
- Don't worry.

798
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:24,035
- 9:00.
- Yeah.

799
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:48,601
Me and you and the dummy
better start making some calls.

800
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:50,978
You hit that stuff
like it was lemonade.

801
00:53:51,062 --> 00:53:53,689
- I'm cold.
- On a hot night like this?

802
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:55,691
I'm hot.

803
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:03,157
You're a big girl now,
ain't ya, Edie?

804
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:05,952
- I even smoke.
- I'll bet.

805
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:08,246
If you're gonna get going
someplace, you better... We got time.

806
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:12,416
- I'm hungry.
- Get something on the way.

807
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,418
I wanna eat here.

808
00:54:14,502 --> 00:54:16,504
We're all out of your favourite dish.

809
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:21,676
Tell the dummy to go out
and get some food and bring it back.

810
00:54:21,801 --> 00:54:25,721
Tell him I wanna talk to you some more
about what Ray said to do.

811
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:44,490
What's he staying for?

812
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:47,159
I told him you was just leaving,
and you wanted him to stay with me.

813
00:54:47,243 --> 00:54:49,870
Being such a good friend of Ray's,
I told him you didn't want me to be alone.

814
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:51,872
You gettin' smart with me, Edie?

815
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:53,874
He reads lips, remember?

816
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:57,128
- I'll see you at the junkyard.
- George will be there.

817
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:59,547
- I gotta go to work.
- Work?

818
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:01,549
If I don't show, I'll get fired.

819
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:06,429
Well, that's too bad.
Does Ray know you're not gonna be there?

820
00:55:06,554 --> 00:55:09,849
Does Ray know she ain't gonna be
with us tonight? Ray wouldn't like it.

821
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:11,851
Rocky, I gotta keep that job.
It's all I got to live on.

822
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:15,354
This is Johnny's night.
She oughta be there. Ray would want that.

823
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:18,149
That's why I said for you
to stick close to her.

824
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:24,155
Mustn't get smart with me, Edie.

825
00:55:34,749 --> 00:55:37,793
I came here, didn't I?
I said everything you told me, didn't I?

826
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:42,048
What more do you want?
I can't swing a club. I can't break a head.

827
00:55:42,131 --> 00:55:45,468
Rocky, I got a right to live too.

828
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:48,137
I got a right to live.

829
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:56,395
Dr. Smith, call Ward 7.

830
00:55:56,479 --> 00:55:59,357
- You mind taking the next car, please?
- Dr. Smith, call Ward 7.

831
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,779
- You're late.
- I know.

832
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:08,282
- I've been looking for you.
- I'm still on Prison Ward, Lefty. Up.

833
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:10,284
- Henry will take you back up.
- Why Henry?

834
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:13,621
He's taking over for me.
I ain't ridin' no elevator tonight.

835
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:15,706
- Why?
- Trouble's coming over from Beaver Canal

836
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:17,708
and I'm gonna get me some.

837
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:19,835
- What are you talking about?
- Jonah just told me.

838
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,921
One of the janitors picked it up
from Joe the barber.

839
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:24,715
He flops in the mission there 'cause he
passes for white. He heard 'em talk.

840
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:27,885
- About what?
- About you and what they're gonna do to nigger town tonight...

841
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:30,137
'cause you killed Johnny Biddle.

842
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:32,640
- You've got to stop them, Lefty.
- Stop who? Beaver Canal?

843
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,850
It won't help. It never has.
It only makes it worse.

844
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:37,103
Not for us it won't.
Not tonight.

845
00:56:37,186 --> 00:56:39,939
- We're gonna be ready tonight.
- You're talking like a crazy man.

846
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:43,025
Yeah, sometimes I do get a little crazy
when these things happen.

847
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:47,113
Like six years ago when Beaver Canal
came over. You were in school.

848
00:56:47,196 --> 00:56:49,281
My kid sister's
still in a wheelchair.

849
00:56:49,365 --> 00:56:51,325
I got this from a broken bottle.

850
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,830
- They're waiting for you outside.
- Thanks, Henry.

851
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:59,834
Lefty. But don't you see?
This way you're no better than they are.

852
00:56:59,959 --> 00:57:02,586
Ain't that askin' a lot
for us to be better than them...

853
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:05,840
when we get killed just trying
to prove we're as good?

854
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:12,263
Okay, boys.

855
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:15,599
I gotta take it up, Doc.

856
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:34,827
Get me Union 64817.
Dr. Brooks, personal.

857
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:42,877
Hello? May I speak
to Alderman Tompkins?

858
00:57:43,002 --> 00:57:44,879
Dr. Brooks at County.

859
00:57:45,004 --> 00:57:47,131
Oh, hello, Mrs. Tompkins.

860
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:49,925
Oh. When do you expect him?

861
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,511
I'm afraid it can't wait till then.

862
00:57:52,595 --> 00:57:54,889
I've got to talk to him
as soon as possible.

863
00:57:55,014 --> 00:57:57,808
I'm on duty and I can't get away.
Please try to get a message to him.

864
00:57:57,892 --> 00:58:02,146
Have him call me here at County at once.
It's vitally urgent.

865
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:04,148
Yes, thank you.

866
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:24,502
- I'm going out.
- Where?

867
00:58:24,585 --> 00:58:26,712
Do I have to say where?
For a walk.

868
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:28,714
I'll be finished in a minute.
I'll go with you.

869
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:31,467
- I wanna walk by myself.
- You mean, you wanna meet Lefty.

870
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:33,677
- I've got a right to take a walk if I want.
- Not where you're going.

871
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:36,305
Let him go.

872
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:39,266
Go on, John.
Take your walk.

873
00:58:57,409 --> 00:59:01,247
You ain't gonna change the world.
You got work to do.

874
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:10,047
Quiet! Quiet down!

875
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,299
Quiet!
Quiet down!

876
00:59:12,383 --> 00:59:14,927
Standing behind that eight ball,
Lefty boy?

877
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:18,305
Now quiet down and listen.

878
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,724
You better do
your laughing now, boy...

879
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:22,810
'cause if you don't listen good...

880
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:25,646
you ain't gonna have no teeth left
to laugh with.

881
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:29,149
Shut up and listen!

882
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:31,277
Quiet down!

883
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:34,446
We're gonna be in four sections.
Y'all know who you're with.

884
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:37,783
I got one. John's got one.
Jonah and Lester.

885
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:41,287
Be quiet going through the streets
and not too many together.

886
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:44,748
We're gonna be at Boot Hill
at sharp 9:00.

887
00:59:44,832 --> 00:59:48,836
They don't know we're comin',
but they're gonna know when we get there.

888
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:53,757
Hold it.
Joe here's got a navy flare gun.

889
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:55,759
That's our signal.

890
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:57,928
Then we come in from four sides.

891
00:59:58,012 --> 01:00:00,514
Any questions -
ask the man in charge.

892
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:03,475
Who hasn't clubs
get 'em here before you go.

893
01:00:03,559 --> 01:00:06,186
And that's all.

894
01:00:13,861 --> 01:00:15,821
Hello?

895
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:20,868
Hello, Mr. Tompkins.
Yes, it's very important.

896
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:23,412
I'll make this quick.
There isn't much time.

897
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:26,040
I haven't called the police, because
it's something you might handle without them.

898
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:28,876
There's gonna be trouble tonight
with Beaver Canal. They're coming over.

899
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:31,712
Lefty Jones is getting
his gang out.

900
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:35,549
With or without the police,
Mr. Tompkins, you've got to stop it.

901
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:39,178
They usually meet
at Lester Peabody's poolroom.

902
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,221
Right.

903
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:51,458
Where ya been, baby?
You lookin' for Rocky?

904
01:01:53,627 --> 01:01:56,797
How ya feelin', baby?
I feel good.

905
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:58,882
Take that, ya black crud!

906
01:01:58,966 --> 01:02:01,468
How do ya like that, black boy?

907
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:03,971
You wanna try it, baby?
You wanna hit a nigger?

908
01:02:04,096 --> 01:02:06,140
Come on, baby.
Hit a nigger! Hit a nigger!

909
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:13,230
What's the matter?
You gone nuts?

910
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:43,463
Prison Ward. Yeah?

911
01:04:43,589 --> 01:04:47,467
Right away. What goes?

912
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:49,469
Right away.

913
01:04:52,681 --> 01:04:55,225
- Emergency Disaster just called for you, Doc.
- What happened?

914
01:04:55,309 --> 01:04:57,436
Race riot. They're
bringing 'em in now.

915
01:04:57,519 --> 01:04:59,646
The basement's
being rigged for emergency.

916
01:05:02,316 --> 01:05:04,484
- Have the nurse finish the dressing.
- Right.

917
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:06,778
Hey, Sheriff.

918
01:05:06,862 --> 01:05:09,781
Let me in on it.
Is there anything left of nigger town?

919
01:05:09,865 --> 01:05:12,326
It's the other way around.
From what I hear...

920
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:14,661
the boogies lowered the boom
on Beaver Canal.

921
01:05:20,709 --> 01:05:22,794
How are we fixed for nurses?

922
01:05:22,878 --> 01:05:24,796
Do what you can.

923
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:28,216
We'll need twice that much plasma.
Get after the bank right away.

924
01:05:28,342 --> 01:05:30,218
That'll hold till I get there.

925
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:32,346
You're doing fine, Wilson.

926
01:05:32,471 --> 01:05:34,431
Soon as I can. Right.

927
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:39,186
Gladys.

928
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,945
Hello there.

929
01:05:48,028 --> 01:05:50,530
What's the matter with you?

930
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:53,241
I feel sick.

931
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:55,827
You look it.

932
01:05:55,911 --> 01:05:58,372
We'd better get you
where you can lie down.

933
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:11,593
Get my coat out of my room.
I've had an emergency call.

934
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:13,595
I know.

935
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:27,651
How'd you know where I lived?

936
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:30,195
Phone book.

937
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:32,990
Why didn't you go
to the hospital?

938
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:36,618
- I didn't want to.
- Why not?

939
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,374
Why not?

940
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:44,918
I don't need a doctor.

941
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:47,004
Then why did you come here?

942
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:51,216
You said you were sick.

943
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:54,636
I am, but not that way.

944
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:56,763
How then?

945
01:06:56,847 --> 01:06:58,807
I don't know.

946
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,817
- Gladys, this is Miss Jackson.
- Johnson.

947
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:12,654
Johnson. She's not well, and I want her
to stay here. Can you sleep over tonight?

948
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:14,948
Be a good night for me
to sleep away from home.

949
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:17,784
Try to stay up till I come back.
I'll call if it gets too late.

950
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:21,288
- You're gonna be there all night.
- When did you hear about it?

951
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:24,249
Like everybody else -
when it was too late.

952
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:31,465
I've got to leave now.
Gladys will take care of you.

953
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,803
You're to do what she says.
Eat when she tells you and sleep.

954
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:42,142
- I was there.
- Where?

955
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:46,313
I ran away before it happened.

956
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:48,899
I could hear it.

957
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:52,360
The noise, the-
the hitting, the yelling.

958
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:56,656
It was all lit up
like the Fourth of July.

959
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:58,700
It was crazy.

960
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:00,702
I don't remember.

961
01:08:03,747 --> 01:08:06,166
It was like they were all

962
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:08,502
comin' after me.

963
01:08:09,836 --> 01:08:11,797
What were you doing there?

964
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:27,020
Feed her and put her to bed
in the study.

965
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:30,690
- What's the matter with her?
- She's had too much to drink, and she's exhausted.

966
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:33,652
There's probably more,
but we can't do anything about it right now.

967
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:36,613
- What about tomorrow morning?
- Have her come to see me at the hospital.

968
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:39,908
- And you take the day off.
- You could use one.

969
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,993
I had one once.

970
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:49,501
Feelin' any better?

971
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:51,545
I got an idea.
You get into bed...

972
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:53,630
and I'll bring your supper
to you on a tray.

973
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:55,632
- I'm not stayin' here.
- No?

974
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:58,009
- What'd he tell you about me?
- That you're wore out.

975
01:08:58,093 --> 01:09:00,053
That you need food,
that you need sleep.

976
01:09:00,178 --> 01:09:01,888
- What else?
- Come on. Let's get-

977
01:09:01,972 --> 01:09:04,474
- You stay away from me.
- I'm just tryin' to help you.

978
01:09:04,558 --> 01:09:07,144
- I don't need your help.
- Well, okay.

979
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:09,729
- Get into bed by yourself.
- I don't want your food.

980
01:09:09,855 --> 01:09:12,732
'Tain't my food.
It's his. I just cook it.

981
01:09:12,816 --> 01:09:14,901
I'm not gonna stay here with you.

982
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:17,070
I'm not gonna sleep
with you around.

983
01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:19,322
What are you afraid of?
Me? Why-

984
01:09:19,406 --> 01:09:22,701
- You keep your hands off me!
- What are you afraid I'll do to you?

985
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:24,911
- I'm gettin' outta here.
- Why?

986
01:09:37,132 --> 01:09:39,843
Come on, honey.
I'll put you into bed.

987
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:49,102
Dr. Thomas wanted in Surgery.

988
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:51,980
Dr.Thomas wanted in Surgery.

989
01:09:54,274 --> 01:09:57,611
Terry! Oh!

990
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:08,496
- What about Surgery?
- Two waiting up there now, and three more ready to go up.

991
01:10:08,622 --> 01:10:10,582
Get them out of here.
We'll need these beds.

992
01:10:10,665 --> 01:10:12,792
Dr. Snyder wants you, Doctor.

993
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:21,635
- Nothing helped.
- He was too far gone when he came in.

994
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:25,138
All right, Snyder. Help out
with the ambulatories. They're jammed.

995
01:10:25,222 --> 01:10:27,474
- Get a screen.
- Yes, Doctor.

996
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:32,687
- How long has he been unconscious?
- He's just come in, Doctor.

997
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:42,614
Terry!

998
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:46,701
Here, you won't
help him that way.

999
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:49,329
Keep your black hands off my boy.

1000
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:15,021
- Brooks.
- Fractured ribs, Doctor.

1001
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:17,857
- I'm afraid of a possible puncture. Over here.
- The last bed.

1002
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:54,853
I never seen such a man for split pea soup -
three and four times a week.

1003
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:57,731
Some men, it's liquor.
With the doctor, it's split pea soup.

1004
01:11:57,856 --> 01:12:02,193
- With my old man, it was liquor.
- He never gets home on time, so soup gets lumpy.

1005
01:12:02,277 --> 01:12:04,404
He sure don't like lumps.

1006
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:07,073
- My mother and me - we got the lumps.
- Hmm?

1007
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:10,076
When my old man would get drunk,
he'd beat up on us.

1008
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:13,246
I got a brother like that.
Drinkin' makes him crazy.

1009
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:15,373
More coffee?

1010
01:12:15,457 --> 01:12:17,876
I wonder what makes 'em
like that-like animals.

1011
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:21,921
I guess maybe they think it proves
somethin' if they can hurt somebody.

1012
01:12:24,132 --> 01:12:27,802
I seen a newsreel once
where some dogs were chasing a rabbit.

1013
01:12:27,927 --> 01:12:31,556
They'd tear it to pieces,
and then they'd go after another one.

1014
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:34,726
And another one.
Like men.

1015
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:36,561
Not all of them.

1016
01:12:37,729 --> 01:12:40,398
- Some dogs don't either.
- Huh.

1017
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:45,445
Gladys, what do you do
on your day off, like today?

1018
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:48,698
Oh, go sit in the park.

1019
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:51,451
Maybe go to church,
maybe to a movie.

1020
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:53,495
Come suppertime,
I go somewhere and cook.

1021
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:55,955
- Where?
- Friends.

1022
01:12:56,081 --> 01:12:59,167
- I fix 'em a good supper.
- Some day off.

1023
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:02,462
I like it. I'm a good cook.

1024
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:05,006
It's somethin' I can do
better than other people.

1025
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:07,008
It makes me a somebody.

1026
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:11,137
Gives me a reason to be alive.
Everybody gotta have that.

1027
01:13:12,222 --> 01:13:14,140
Or a reason not to be.

1028
01:13:14,224 --> 01:13:17,394
- Oh. The doctor's come home.
- Better make some fresh coffee.

1029
01:13:17,477 --> 01:13:21,231
He only takes milk when he's been
up all night. Helps him to sleep.

1030
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:24,984
- Workin' day and night - what's he get out of it?
- Circles under his eyes.

1031
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:28,696
- Then why does he do it?
- He says it's a doctor's job.

1032
01:13:28,822 --> 01:13:30,698
He says doctors
ain't like other people...

1033
01:13:30,824 --> 01:13:33,993
and they shouldn't expect
to live like 'em.

1034
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:36,162
Do you know the coloured one -
Dr. Brooks?

1035
01:13:36,287 --> 01:13:40,542
Luther? Sure. Why?

1036
01:13:44,796 --> 01:13:47,882
- Gladys, I told you weeks ago to get that lock fixed.
- Here's your milk.

1037
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:50,552
You never pay the slightest attention
to what I say around here.

1038
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:53,012
- I'm getting sick and tired-
- You're tired all right.

1039
01:13:53,138 --> 01:13:55,473
That's what makes you so touchy.

1040
01:13:55,557 --> 01:13:58,017
Someday, somebody's gonna
walk right in here and grab you.

1041
01:13:58,143 --> 01:14:00,645
I stopped worrying about that
20 years ago.

1042
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:02,897
- How are you this morning?
- Okay.

1043
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:05,233
- She give you much trouble?
- We got along fine.

1044
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:08,862
- Drink your milk.
- Come in to see me at the hospital this afternoon.

1045
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:11,906
- I feel fine.
- About 3:00. I want to talk to you some more.

1046
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:13,908
- When are you leaving?
- Soon as I clean up.

1047
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:17,162
I'll be asleep before then.
If anyone calls before you go, I'm out.

1048
01:14:17,245 --> 01:14:20,373
- Unless it's Dr. Brooks.
- Luther works nights.

1049
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:22,876
Why won't he be sleepin'
same as you?

1050
01:14:23,001 --> 01:14:25,545
If he's asleep,
the chances are he won't call me.

1051
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:27,547
You know that ain't what I mean.

1052
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:30,300
Gladys, I am much too tired-

1053
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:32,510
- I'll get it.
- You're too tired.

1054
01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:38,683
What'd you wanna
talk to me about?

1055
01:14:38,766 --> 01:14:40,727
I was wondering how you made out
with Ray Biddle.

1056
01:14:40,852 --> 01:14:42,812
They tell me
you saw him yesterday.

1057
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:47,609
It can wait.

1058
01:14:47,734 --> 01:14:51,571
Is that-
Is Dr. Brooks in any trouble?

1059
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:54,407
- Not that I know of. Why?
- It's just that-

1060
01:14:54,532 --> 01:14:56,826
Well, from the way
you and Gladys were talking-

1061
01:15:00,747 --> 01:15:03,917
- Mrs. Brooks.
- They told me at the hospital you had left.

1062
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,960
Oh, this is Miss Johnson.
Dr. Brooke's wife.

1063
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:07,754
- How do you do?
- Hello.

1064
01:15:07,879 --> 01:15:10,131
- Sit down. How about some breakfast?
- No. Don't trouble. I-

1065
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:12,550
Sit down.

1066
01:15:12,634 --> 01:15:15,720
- Where's Luther?
- Luther's in jail.

1067
01:15:17,764 --> 01:15:21,017
- For what?
- He's given himself up for the murder of John Biddle.

1068
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,937
What for'd he do
a crazy thing like that?

1069
01:15:24,062 --> 01:15:26,022
I stayed with him
as long as I could.

1070
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:30,360
He told me to come to you to tell you
before you read about it in the papers.

1071
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:34,113
- Start from the beginning.
- Who knows where a thing like this begins?

1072
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:38,159
You should've seen him
when he came home.

1073
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:40,787
2:00 this morning.
Maybe 3:00. I don't know.

1074
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:42,830
He'd been walking for hours.

1075
01:15:42,956 --> 01:15:44,916
He woke us up - all of us.

1076
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:47,752
He's never been like that -
almost crazy.

1077
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:51,631
- He hated everybody.
- Everybody white.

1078
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:55,009
Even you.

1079
01:15:56,511 --> 01:15:59,305
He made John take Connie and Mother
to our cousin's house.

1080
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:02,934
He said ours wasn't safe.
They'd burn it down. We'd be killed.

1081
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:05,645
We had to realise
we weren't human beings.

1082
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:07,730
We were just so much dirt.

1083
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:12,485
He wouldn't go to bed after they left,
so we walked again.

1084
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:15,029
We walked till it was
almost light.

1085
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:17,740
Then, all of a sudden,
he was calm.

1086
01:16:17,824 --> 01:16:19,993
We sat in the park...

1087
01:16:20,118 --> 01:16:22,745
and he told me
he knew what he had to do-

1088
01:16:22,829 --> 01:16:27,500
that the only thing that could help him
or us or anybody was the truth.

1089
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:30,003
But it ain't the truth
that he murdered that man.

1090
01:16:30,128 --> 01:16:35,008
Of course he didn't. And that's
what he says the autopsy will prove.

1091
01:16:35,133 --> 01:16:37,468
- The autopsy?
- It's at 4:00 this afternoon.

1092
01:16:37,552 --> 01:16:40,013
He wanted to be sure
you knew about it.

1093
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:42,307
The autopsy.
So that's it.

1094
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:45,393
He's had himself arrested
to force the autopsy.

1095
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:47,437
Now that there's
a presumptive evidence of crime...

1096
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,439
the coroner has no choice...

1097
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,774
and a confession
is certainly presumptive evidence.

1098
01:16:51,858 --> 01:16:55,111
It will prove Luther didn't do it,
won't it, Doctor?

1099
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:59,616
Mrs. Brooks, any doctor might have treated
John Biddle just as your husband did.

1100
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:02,327
There is a chance he made a mistake,
just as any other doctor might have.

1101
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:04,412
Luther says that too.

1102
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:07,498
Either way, though, he says,
we'll know the truth.

1103
01:17:07,582 --> 01:17:11,210
- It can be rough on him if it goes wrong.
- I know that.

1104
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:14,505
- He's quite a guy.
- I know that too.

1105
01:17:15,882 --> 01:17:18,468
- I'm going down to see Luther.
- What about your sleep?

1106
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:22,513
I've got work to do. He'll get a fair shake.
I can promise you that.

1107
01:17:22,597 --> 01:17:25,266
I'll drop you off if you like.
Ready to go?

1108
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:27,268
See you later, Mrs. Brooks.
Have a nice day, Gladys.

1109
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:29,354
You get some sleep.

1110
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:33,566
- Bye, Mrs. Brooks.
- Good-bye.

1111
01:17:35,068 --> 01:17:37,403
- Thanks, Gladys.
- Good luck.

1112
01:17:45,453 --> 01:17:48,539
That's it, baby.
Let it go.

1113
01:17:49,666 --> 01:17:53,419
They're gone now.
They can't hear you.

1114
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:12,438
- How about a cigarette?
- No.

1115
01:18:12,563 --> 01:18:15,483
- It's been over an hour.
- No.

1116
01:19:34,771 --> 01:19:37,523
- You made a good diagnosis, Doctor.
- Then you found it.

1117
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:40,651
Glioma. Couldn't miss it.
Large areas of hemorrhage.

1118
01:19:40,735 --> 01:19:42,862
- Luther.
- Easy, honey.

1119
01:19:44,197 --> 01:19:46,157
I know, I know.
What's this all about?

1120
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,576
It's official now, Biddle.

1121
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:51,579
Your brother died of a brain tumour,
just as Dr. Brooks diagnosed it.

1122
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:54,499
- Says who?
- I say so, young man.

1123
01:19:54,582 --> 01:19:57,418
And I shall so inform
the district attorney.

1124
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:59,545
The spinal puncture
was fully justified.

1125
01:19:59,629 --> 01:20:02,673
Dr. Brooks was doing everything
he could to save your brother's life.

1126
01:20:02,757 --> 01:20:04,592
By determining
the intercranial pressure-

1127
01:20:04,717 --> 01:20:06,594
Stop with that
doctor's double-talk!

1128
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:09,472
He killed Johnny. He confessed it.
That's why he's in jail.

1129
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:11,599
You were supposed
to find out how he did it.

1130
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:14,227
Now you're sayin' he didn't.
Well, I say you're liars.

1131
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:16,229
- You're puttin' up a front for him.
- Easy does it.

1132
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:19,190
Haven't you figured out yet
why he confessed?

1133
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:21,901
To force the autopsy
you wouldn't let him have.

1134
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:24,445
- To prove he didn't kill your brother.
- Who'd he prove it to?

1135
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:27,114
- Not to me, he didn't.
- Perhaps you'd like to see for yourself.

1136
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:29,617
How would I know
what you showed me?

1137
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:33,246
You guys stick together - black and white -
like some kind of a mob.

1138
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:36,582
Then bring your own doctor.
Any doctor, anyone you believe.

1139
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:39,210
I believe what I see.

1140
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:41,254
I seen you kill Johnny.

1141
01:20:41,379 --> 01:20:43,256
- But it's just been proved...
- It's no use, Luther.

1142
01:20:43,381 --> 01:20:46,759
You've done everything you could -
more than anyone had a right to ask of you.

1143
01:20:46,884 --> 01:20:50,179
You've convinced everyone in this city
but one sick mind.

1144
01:20:50,263 --> 01:20:53,558
- Let it go at that.
- Not everybody, Doc.

1145
01:20:53,641 --> 01:20:55,893
There's a lot more like me.

1146
01:20:55,977 --> 01:20:57,895
Then maybe
some future autopsy

1147
01:20:57,979 --> 01:21:01,107
will show us how you
got to be that way.

1148
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:04,402
You go on back. Dr. Cheney
will phone the district attorney

1149
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:06,696
and you'll be released
on your own recognisance.

1150
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:09,282
Then after the inquest tomorrow,
you'll be discharged from custody.

1151
01:21:09,407 --> 01:21:11,284
- What about tonight?
- What about it?

1152
01:21:11,409 --> 01:21:15,079
- Will you want me for duty?
- No. Technically, you're still in the clink.

1153
01:21:15,162 --> 01:21:18,958
- See that he gets some sleep.
- And starts forgetting this ever happened.

1154
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:22,128
- How can I begin to thank you two?
- This is not a high tea.

1155
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:24,130
The amenities can be dispensed with.

1156
01:21:24,255 --> 01:21:27,425
Would you have thanked us
if you'd been wrong?

1157
01:21:27,508 --> 01:21:29,427
Let's get outta here before
they change their minds.

1158
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:31,762
- I'm glad it turned out all right.
- Thanks.

1159
01:21:31,846 --> 01:21:34,140
- I'm glad for both of you.
- Thanks, Miss Johnson.

1160
01:21:37,435 --> 01:21:39,645
Thanks, Miss Johnson.

1161
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:43,149
Why don't you take
that maniac out of here?

1162
01:21:43,274 --> 01:21:45,359
Wagon don't come back
till half past 5:00.

1163
01:21:47,153 --> 01:21:50,072
- What are you doing here?
- I just thought I'd come.

1164
01:21:50,156 --> 01:21:53,200
- I'm glad you did.
- Nice of you to drop in, Miss Johnson.

1165
01:21:53,326 --> 01:21:57,288
- Make him shut up.
- Don't pay any attention. He's a mental case.

1166
01:21:57,371 --> 01:21:59,457
Whatever happened
to Mrs. Johnny Biddle?

1167
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:02,293
She layin' somewheres
cut in pieces like Johnny in there?

1168
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:06,172
I'm more to Johnny this minute - and he's
more to me - than you ever were to anybody.

1169
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:08,174
You picked a good way
of showin' it-

1170
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:10,676
goin' back on him and me
and your whole life up to now.

1171
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:14,430
I never went back on Johnny ever,
except on account of you.

1172
01:22:14,513 --> 01:22:17,391
And as for you
and my whole life up to now-

1173
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:42,333
Time to close up shop.
You ready, Dan?

1174
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:45,002
Handing Brooks tonight off
gave me an idea.

1175
01:22:45,086 --> 01:22:47,380
Hope it starts with
my buying you a drink.

1176
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:50,424
Right. Next, I inform
the county hospital...

1177
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:53,970
that Dr. Wharton will be unavailable
until tomorrow morning.

1178
01:22:54,053 --> 01:22:57,390
Next, I get into that bedpan
I use for an automobile and drive.

1179
01:22:57,515 --> 01:23:00,017
- Where?
- One half hour from here...

1180
01:23:00,101 --> 01:23:03,145
in a certain summer hotel at Lakeview,
there's a certain bed.

1181
01:23:03,229 --> 01:23:06,482
One half hour from now,
I will be asleep in that bed.

1182
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:08,651
Sometime, I want to spend
a year in that bed.

1183
01:23:08,734 --> 01:23:12,405
And when I die, I wanna die in that bed.

1184
01:23:37,638 --> 01:23:40,141
What's he hangin' around for?
It's all over.

1185
01:23:40,266 --> 01:23:42,393
He likes to hang around.

1186
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:46,147
- Well, tell him to beat it.
- What's he gonna hurt?

1187
01:23:46,272 --> 01:23:48,232
Come on.
We'll wait downstairs.

1188
01:23:48,315 --> 01:23:51,902
- Hey. Hey, take it easy.
- What's eatin' you?

1189
01:23:51,986 --> 01:23:56,240
- I got a kink in my good leg.
- It'll go away.

1190
01:23:56,323 --> 01:23:59,160
- Let me walk it out for a minute, will ya?
- Okay.

1191
01:24:02,913 --> 01:24:04,874
Boy. That's a bad one.

1192
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:09,336
I used to get these
all the time playin' ball.

1193
01:24:09,462 --> 01:24:12,631
- How were you, pretty good?
- Not bad. I played some semipro.

1194
01:24:52,463 --> 01:24:54,340
Get the car.

1195
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:58,010
Hey.

1196
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:22,284
- Gonna be a hot night.
- Looks like.

1197
01:25:22,368 --> 01:25:26,247
Beats me why all of a sudden
you want to move-a hot night like this?

1198
01:25:26,372 --> 01:25:29,041
Well, when you gotta go,
Mr. Reilly, you gotta go.

1199
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:31,877
I've been thinkin'
I might put in new wallpaper...

1200
01:25:32,002 --> 01:25:33,963
if you decided to stay on.

1201
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:36,006
Thanks just the same.

1202
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:51,438
Hello, Miss Johnson.

1203
01:25:55,442 --> 01:25:58,195
We kept it dark in here
because we thought you'd like it better...

1204
01:25:58,279 --> 01:26:00,406
If you couldn't tell
we were white.

1205
01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:05,327
Now I'll turn the lights on.

1206
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:14,753
My leg.

1207
01:26:14,879 --> 01:26:17,339
I must have hurt it bad
comin' down that fire escape.

1208
01:26:17,423 --> 01:26:19,425
It's bleedin' like a faucet.

1209
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:24,388
Nah. I ain't got time.
Put her in a chair.

1210
01:26:33,772 --> 01:26:36,233
Give me some water.
Water!

1211
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:44,491
Put your hand on her mouth
so she can't yell.

1212
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:55,753
I'd like to play games with you,
but I'm too tired. I got too much to do.

1213
01:26:55,836 --> 01:26:57,796
And you're gonna do
somethin' for me.

1214
01:26:57,922 --> 01:27:01,091
You're goin' out with George and make
a phone call to your boogie boyfriend.

1215
01:27:01,175 --> 01:27:03,135
You're gonna say
what George tells you.

1216
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:05,804
He's gonna watch your lips
when you talk.

1217
01:27:06,931 --> 01:27:08,974
George.

1218
01:27:11,101 --> 01:27:14,563
Don't be a hero. You don't get medals
for being a nigger lover.

1219
01:27:14,647 --> 01:27:17,191
Just a lousy phone call, Edie.

1220
01:27:17,316 --> 01:27:19,193
Oh, yeah, you got character,
ain't ya?

1221
01:27:19,318 --> 01:27:21,195
You ain't smart,
but you got character.

1222
01:27:22,404 --> 01:27:24,657
Okay. We play games.

1223
01:27:31,622 --> 01:27:35,751
The last of the Mohicans.
I've been dry as a bone.

1224
01:27:35,834 --> 01:27:40,172
We brought our own beer, Edie. Thought that
was only fair. You're doing your part.

1225
01:27:42,341 --> 01:27:44,468
Anyway, you're gonna do it.
So make up your mind soon...

1226
01:27:44,551 --> 01:27:47,638
you could wind up
in worse shape than me.

1227
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:51,350
I thought you'd jump at the chance
to speak to him...

1228
01:27:51,433 --> 01:27:53,602
for the last time.

1229
01:27:58,274 --> 01:28:00,985
There oughta be a law about apple fritters.

1230
01:28:01,068 --> 01:28:04,238
After a certain number,
it gets to be a vicious habit, like drugs.

1231
01:28:04,363 --> 01:28:06,407
- Eat some more while they're hot.
- I've had five.

1232
01:28:06,532 --> 01:28:08,492
Can't hardly get
the taste in your mouth with only five.

1233
01:28:08,575 --> 01:28:10,494
That's because you eat 'em
five at a time.

1234
01:28:10,577 --> 01:28:12,496
I'll get it.

1235
01:28:12,579 --> 01:28:16,583
Sit still, honey.
I need the exercise.

1236
01:28:16,709 --> 01:28:20,421
Isn't it wonderful how suddenly apple fritters
can become the biggest worry you've got?

1237
01:28:20,546 --> 01:28:24,049
Ain't so wonderful if you ain't got the
apples or the flour or the fat to fry 'em in.

1238
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,426
Now, really.

1239
01:28:25,509 --> 01:28:28,012
Ain't no such thing as big worries
and little worries.

1240
01:28:28,095 --> 01:28:31,682
All worries are the same size.
Just depends on who's got 'em.

1241
01:28:31,765 --> 01:28:34,768
Mother, when do you suppose you're gonna
start getting some fun out of life?

1242
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:37,563
- Most likely when I die.
- More coffee.

1243
01:28:37,646 --> 01:28:40,399
I'm gonna have to leave for a while,
but I'll be back in time for the show.

1244
01:28:40,524 --> 01:28:44,028
- Who was it?
- A woman just called from some hotel in Lakeview.

1245
01:28:44,111 --> 01:28:47,948
Said Dr. Wharton's on his way in and would I
meet him at his home in about a half hour.

1246
01:28:48,073 --> 01:28:51,744
It must be something pretty important
to drag him back from that hideaway of his.

1247
01:28:51,827 --> 01:28:55,122
Maybe he's heard from Moreland.
Maybe my application.

1248
01:28:55,247 --> 01:28:57,666
I'd sooner it was Dr. Clark's house
you was goin' to.

1249
01:28:57,750 --> 01:29:00,586
- I wouldn't.
- Wouldn't you really?

1250
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:03,213
I want you to be the kind of doctor
you want to be.

1251
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:08,594
Pass me some more
of them fritters.

1252
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:10,888
I just hope you whistle
good and loud before you bust.

1253
01:30:24,378 --> 01:30:26,296
Well, how'd it go?

1254
01:30:31,844 --> 01:30:34,012
Did you talk to him?
Did you say what I told ya?

1255
01:30:34,096 --> 01:30:36,056
Not you.
I want her to tell me.

1256
01:30:37,975 --> 01:30:40,352
Do you want some more
of what you got?

1257
01:30:40,477 --> 01:30:42,688
- Answer me!
- I talked to him.

1258
01:30:42,813 --> 01:30:45,607
Wharton's house in half an hour?

1259
01:30:45,691 --> 01:30:49,027
- He said he'd be there.
- Yeah. Most likely be early.

1260
01:30:49,153 --> 01:30:51,238
Chance to suck around
a white man.

1261
01:30:51,363 --> 01:30:53,782
"Yassuh, boss. Yassuh."

1262
01:30:53,866 --> 01:30:56,034
Well, I'll be there ahead of him.

1263
01:30:56,118 --> 01:30:58,495
I'll be there with the lights on
and the door open.

1264
01:30:58,579 --> 01:31:01,039
Oughta have a brass band.

1265
01:31:01,165 --> 01:31:04,585
Black louse killed my brother.

1266
01:31:06,879 --> 01:31:09,756
I'm hot. I'm hot.

1267
01:31:09,882 --> 01:31:12,926
Open a window.
I'm burnin' up.

1268
01:31:13,051 --> 01:31:17,389
- "Sophisticated Lady."
- No more beer!

1269
01:31:36,116 --> 01:31:38,619
Oh, my leg.

1270
01:31:38,744 --> 01:31:41,747
The bleedin's stopped, but it's swollen.
It's beatin' like a drum.

1271
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:47,711
But who cares?
Who cares about me?

1272
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:50,923
Does anybody care if I'm bleedin' to death,
if I'm burnin' up?

1273
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:52,925
If I'm alive or dead? No!

1274
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:56,386
Nobody cares about Ray Biddle
'cause he ain't a stinkin' nigger!

1275
01:31:59,515 --> 01:32:01,433
Okay.

1276
01:32:01,558 --> 01:32:03,769
Okay, I don't need nobody.
I never did.

1277
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:06,813
Give me some dough for a cab.

1278
01:32:06,939 --> 01:32:08,815
Yeah, I remember. 324 Walnut.

1279
01:32:08,941 --> 01:32:11,652
Keep your eye on her.
Don't let her turn her back so she can yell.

1280
01:32:11,777 --> 01:32:13,737
You won't have long to wait.

1281
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:16,823
Keep yourself busy.
You'll hardly know the time's passin'.

1282
01:32:22,913 --> 01:32:25,249
Maybe you'd like
to finish your packin'.

1283
01:32:26,917 --> 01:32:30,462
Where were you gonna go
when we busted in on ya?

1284
01:32:30,546 --> 01:32:32,506
Where were you goin', Edie?

1285
01:32:32,631 --> 01:32:35,759
- I don't know.
- Just anywheres, huh?

1286
01:32:35,842 --> 01:32:39,304
Away from this terrible place
and us terrible people.

1287
01:32:39,388 --> 01:32:42,349
Well, finish up.
When I get back, we'll all go.

1288
01:32:42,474 --> 01:32:44,810
All the Biddies together -
one lovin' family.

1289
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:47,437
Johnny would've liked that.

1290
01:32:47,521 --> 01:32:50,524
- You'll like it too.
- Don't do it, Ray. I beg you not to do it.

1291
01:32:50,649 --> 01:32:52,734
You ain't on your knees.
You gotta beg on our knees.

1292
01:32:52,818 --> 01:32:54,736
- He didn't kill Johnny.
- I say he did.

1293
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:56,572
- You know he didn't!
- I say he did!

1294
01:32:56,655 --> 01:32:58,907
You're just sayin' it because you want to,
because you gotta have somethin' to hate.

1295
01:32:58,991 --> 01:33:03,954
Okay! I just got it in my mind to
kill a coon. Argue me outta that one.

1296
01:33:52,377 --> 01:33:55,422
What's that
seven bucks doin' in your pants?

1297
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:57,424
You stay outta my pants!

1298
01:33:57,549 --> 01:34:00,385
- Where'd you get 'em?
- I won 'em shootin' crap! I told you that!

1299
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:04,056
Every payday you win seven bucks?
In a pig's eye!

1300
01:34:04,181 --> 01:34:05,390
Gimme back my dough!

1301
01:34:05,474 --> 01:34:07,809
Holdin' out on your wife and kids!
You cheap chiseler!

1302
01:34:07,893 --> 01:34:09,895
Come back here with that seven bucks!

1303
01:34:09,978 --> 01:34:12,230
Here's an oldie but a goody.

1304
01:34:12,356 --> 01:34:14,900
Guess what and guess who.

1305
01:34:29,081 --> 01:34:31,625
Okay if I turn on the radio
while I pack?

1306
01:34:51,269 --> 01:34:53,939
Shut that radio down!

1307
01:34:54,064 --> 01:34:57,609
What's the matter, you gone deaf!

1308
01:34:57,734 --> 01:35:01,947
Stop that awful racket!

1309
01:35:04,032 --> 01:35:07,327
Turn off that radio!

1310
01:35:07,452 --> 01:35:11,623
What are you, crazy or somethin' in there!

1311
01:35:12,958 --> 01:35:15,168
I'll call the landlord! Mr. Reilly!

1312
01:35:15,293 --> 01:35:17,671
Open up the door!

1313
01:35:30,642 --> 01:35:33,854
Grab him and call a cop!
He tried to kill me!

1314
01:35:33,979 --> 01:35:37,023
- What's goin' on?
- What are ya tryin' to do?

1315
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:41,713
County Hospital?
Give me the police ward.

1316
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:45,133
Anybody up there.

1317
01:36:45,217 --> 01:36:48,053
Hello. Look, this is important.

1318
01:36:48,178 --> 01:36:50,055
Ray Biddle is at
Dr. Wharton's house...

1319
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:52,766
and he's gonna kill Dr. Brooks.

1320
01:36:52,891 --> 01:36:56,520
Yeah, yeah. Biddle -
the one that got away this afternoon.

1321
01:36:56,603 --> 01:36:59,731
It don't make any difference who this is.
Get somebody up there right away.

1322
01:36:59,815 --> 01:37:01,733
324 Walnut.

1323
01:37:01,817 --> 01:37:03,819
Get somebody up there quick!

1324
01:37:10,742 --> 01:37:13,078
Taxi!

1325
01:37:13,203 --> 01:37:15,080
Taxi!

1326
01:37:16,206 --> 01:37:18,542
Check and see
if Dr. Wharton is home.

1327
01:37:18,625 --> 01:37:22,754
If no, check Dr. Brooks.
If no, check if Ray Biddle's been picked up.

1328
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:25,966
If no all around, get a squad car quick
down to Dr. Wharton's house.

1329
01:37:26,091 --> 01:37:28,218
- 324 Walnut.
- Yes, sir.

1330
01:38:46,171 --> 01:38:48,173
Hey.

1331
01:38:56,139 --> 01:38:58,850
Put your hands in your pockets.

1332
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:12,757
You keep droppin' in places,
don't you?

1333
01:40:12,882 --> 01:40:16,261
In your pockets, sambo.

1334
01:40:16,344 --> 01:40:19,055
"Sambo." I keep callin' him that.

1335
01:40:19,139 --> 01:40:21,057
All the time - sambo.

1336
01:40:21,141 --> 01:40:24,769
Little Black Sambo-
like when I was a kid.

1337
01:40:24,853 --> 01:40:28,898
It's funny. I been - I been thinkin'
all night about when I was a kid.

1338
01:40:28,982 --> 01:40:30,984
Little Black Sambo.

1339
01:40:31,109 --> 01:40:35,530
I- I can't remember the story.
Only-Only the name.

1340
01:40:35,613 --> 01:40:38,992
And-And catch a nigger
by the toe.

1341
01:40:39,117 --> 01:40:40,994
If he hollers, let 'im go.

1342
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:44,330
Yeah, that's what we're playin', Edie.
Only he don't holler.

1343
01:40:44,456 --> 01:40:46,332
And I ain't gonna let him go.

1344
01:40:47,792 --> 01:40:50,587
But they said it wasn't
nice to say "nigger."

1345
01:40:54,507 --> 01:40:56,968
Nigger! Nigger!

1346
01:40:57,052 --> 01:40:58,762
Nigger!

1347
01:40:58,845 --> 01:41:02,807
Poor little nigger kids.
Love the little nigger kids.

1348
01:41:02,891 --> 01:41:06,061
Who loved me?
Who loved me?

1349
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:12,817
Oh, Edie. Edie, I'm-
I'm burnin' up.

1350
01:41:12,942 --> 01:41:15,820
- Get me some water.
- No.

1351
01:41:21,451 --> 01:41:23,953
- How'd you get here?
- I got here.

1352
01:41:24,037 --> 01:41:26,831
- Who's with ya?
- Nobody.

1353
01:41:26,915 --> 01:41:31,294
- Then why'd you come?
- To try and stop you.

1354
01:41:31,377 --> 01:41:34,339
In your pockets, sambo.

1355
01:41:36,883 --> 01:41:40,220
- How you gonna stop me, Edie?
- I don't know.

1356
01:41:41,429 --> 01:41:43,348
- You called the cops.
- No.

1357
01:41:43,431 --> 01:41:45,350
You called the cops.
You're tryin' to stall me.

1358
01:41:45,433 --> 01:41:49,562
You wanna have a talk, Edie, a nice long talk
so's the cops can get here?

1359
01:41:49,687 --> 01:41:52,357
- That's kid stuff. You're too smart.
- No, I ain't smart.

1360
01:41:52,482 --> 01:41:55,026
He's smart. He's a doctor.
He went to college.

1361
01:41:55,110 --> 01:41:57,070
I'm garbage, remember?

1362
01:41:57,195 --> 01:42:00,657
Why don't he jump me? Why don't he take
a chance? What's he got to lose?

1363
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:02,909
Maybe he wants to live
as long as he can.

1364
01:42:03,034 --> 01:42:04,869
Yeah? Johnny wanted
to live too.

1365
01:42:04,953 --> 01:42:06,830
You're not thinkin' about Johnny.

1366
01:42:06,913 --> 01:42:10,542
We're just talkin'.
I-I got no time to talk.

1367
01:42:10,625 --> 01:42:13,920
- I'm burnin' up. I'm burnin' up.
- You're sick, Ray.

1368
01:42:14,045 --> 01:42:16,214
You're sick in your mind.
You're crazy.

1369
01:42:17,757 --> 01:42:20,718
Maybe, but-I-I just got no time.

1370
01:42:20,802 --> 01:42:23,513
I got no time.

1371
01:42:23,596 --> 01:42:26,057
Okay, sambo.

1372
01:42:26,182 --> 01:42:28,143
This is it.

1373
01:42:30,728 --> 01:42:33,106
Lay down on the couch.

1374
01:42:33,231 --> 01:42:35,191
Like Johnny.

1375
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:43,783
Lay down.

1376
01:42:43,908 --> 01:42:46,619
No. Don't turn your back.
I wanna see your face.

1377
01:42:48,746 --> 01:42:51,791
Now get your legs up.
Get 'em way up.

1378
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:53,793
Just like Johnny.

1379
01:42:53,918 --> 01:42:57,463
Yeah. You help me,
and I'll help you.

1380
01:42:57,589 --> 01:43:00,758
- Just like you told him.
- Let me get you some water, Ray.

1381
01:43:00,842 --> 01:43:05,471
Yeah, sure. Sure, you go into the kitchen
and get it. I'll be right in.

1382
01:43:07,432 --> 01:43:09,976
- I'll bring it in to you.
- No. You wait there.

1383
01:43:11,269 --> 01:43:13,605
- I'll be right in.
- It'll just take a minute.

1384
01:43:13,688 --> 01:43:15,607
I got no time to talk.

1385
01:43:16,566 --> 01:43:18,943
Luther!

1386
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:36,961
- You all right?
- My arm.

1387
01:43:37,045 --> 01:43:39,005
Maybe my shoulder.
I can't tell.

1388
01:43:40,632 --> 01:43:43,801
- It's not so bad.
- My leg!

1389
01:43:43,927 --> 01:43:47,347
It tore.

1390
01:43:47,472 --> 01:43:49,599
Somethin' tore in my leg.

1391
01:43:57,607 --> 01:43:59,567
It's-It's bleedin'.

1392
01:43:59,651 --> 01:44:01,861
It's bleedin' hard.
Please!

1393
01:44:01,986 --> 01:44:04,113
Let it bleed.

1394
01:44:06,449 --> 01:44:08,284
Tear it some more.
Let it bleed fast.

1395
01:44:08,368 --> 01:44:11,663
- You'll have to help me.
- To do what?

1396
01:44:11,746 --> 01:44:13,831
Whatever I can to keep him alive.

1397
01:44:13,915 --> 01:44:15,875
Why? What for?

1398
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,879
A human being's gotta have a reason
for bein' alive. He hasn't got any.

1399
01:44:20,004 --> 01:44:22,298
He's not even human.
He's a mad dog.

1400
01:44:22,382 --> 01:44:25,134
- You kill mad dogs, don't ya?
- Don't you think I'd like to?

1401
01:44:25,218 --> 01:44:27,387
Don't you think I'd like to put the rest
of these bullets through his head?

1402
01:44:27,512 --> 01:44:29,180
- Then go ahead.
- I can't.

1403
01:44:29,305 --> 01:44:31,891
- Why not?
- Because I've got to live too.

1404
01:44:32,016 --> 01:44:35,895
- Then give it to me.
- You've got to live.

1405
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:38,982
I will, believe me -
happy as a bird with him dead.

1406
01:44:39,065 --> 01:44:41,651
- Please help me.
- No.

1407
01:44:41,734 --> 01:44:45,530
Look, he's sick. He's crazy.
He's everything you said.

1408
01:44:45,655 --> 01:44:48,199
But I can't kill a man
just because he hates me.

1409
01:44:59,043 --> 01:45:01,004
What do you want me to do?

1410
01:45:02,672 --> 01:45:04,632
Take your scarf off.

1411
01:45:07,135 --> 01:45:09,846
Put it around his thigh.
There.

1412
01:45:14,517 --> 01:45:16,477
And tie a knot.

1413
01:45:17,645 --> 01:45:19,605
Not too tight.

1414
01:45:33,077 --> 01:45:35,872
You sure you're all right?

1415
01:45:35,955 --> 01:45:37,874
Thanks.

1416
01:45:49,594 --> 01:45:51,554
They took their time gettin' here.

1417
01:46:06,611 --> 01:46:09,697
Don't cry, white boy.

1418
01:46:09,781 --> 01:46:11,783
You're gonna live.
