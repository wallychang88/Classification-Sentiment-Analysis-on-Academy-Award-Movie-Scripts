1
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:27,652
- Playback, please.
- Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,365
- Camera two, clear bars.
- Come on, let's hustle up.

3
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,243
Camera two is clear.

4
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:38,287
- The red hair was a good idea.
- We talked about cutting it.

5
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:43,751
- What did she say?
- She'll do what we tell her.

6
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:47,839
- Forty seconds.
- Studio B, this is remote.

7
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:51,134
We come out tight.

8
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:55,221
Studio B, this is Kimberly.
How soon do we go live?

9
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:04,272
Hey, hey, fellas!
Anybody listening to me?

10
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:11,320
- Is Mac there?
- Mac here. What is it?

11
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:17,034
We need five minutes before we go on.
How about after the commercial?

12
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:22,582
Not a chance, Kimberly.
We're coming to you in 40 seconds.

13
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:27,837
- No! We don't have a cameraman.
- Where's George?

14
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:31,758
He's taking a leak.
He locked the camera down.

15
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,011
You can't have a 2 and a half minute spot
on a static shot.

16
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:38,681
Better tell Pete to stretch
because remote's gonna be late.

17
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,475
Stretch, Pete. Slow it down.

18
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:46,606
Mac, can you start on a tight shot
and pull back to a wide?

19
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:49,484
Just get George back.

20
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:55,990
George?
We've got less than a minute.

21
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:59,327
We're about to go on the air.
Thanks.

22
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:03,247
You all ready? Everybody ready?

23
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:06,626
Break a leg!

24
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,586
Do I look okay?

25
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:11,547
The wind is from the south-southwest
at 5 miles an hour.

26
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:16,844
Now we switch to Kimberly Wells
for a live mini-cam report.

27
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:20,223
What did you do on
someone's birthday?

28
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:24,227
Send a card or flowers? Boring?

29
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,020
Here's something more imaginative.

30
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,943
What the hell is this?
What the hell is this?

31
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:42,203
This is one part of a new group
taking L.A. By storm.

32
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:48,084
"Live Wires", singing telegrams.
There's one for every occasion.

33
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:08,104
If it's your parents' anniversary,
you could send them an "operagram".

34
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:13,401
Or maybe your message
can't be expressed in words.

35
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,573
- That's the stuff I want to see.
- Look at this!

36
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,578
Get in tight on the navel.
Oh, mercy!

37
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,417
That is a "bellygram."

38
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:33,296
- Words cannot express that.
- That's the kind of stuff I like.

39
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:38,467
- Our ratings have gone up.
- Our research said she'd do well.

40
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:43,139
Very nice show, Kimberly.

41
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:47,476
Mac here. Can you hear me?

42
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,521
- Change of schedule.
- Again?

43
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,816
- We're going to Ventana.
- Great!

44
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:57,820
- Be there at 1:30.
- What about Richard and Hector?

45
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,407
- They'll pick you up.
- Right, okay.

46
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:06,829
Can I have a hit? Thanks.
I don't smoke.

47
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,917
It's 12:40 in Los Angeles...

48
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,377
temperature is 68 degrees
at the Civic Center.

49
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:17,715
Here's a new one, on the charts
for the first time this week.

50
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,767
They're here, Mr. Gibson.

51
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:41,108
Hi, Miss Wells.
Bill Gibson, Public Relations.

52
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:45,613
- Ventana special, take one.
- Okay, Kimberly, any time.

53
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:52,453
I'm Kimberly Wells, and I'm here
at the Ventana nuclear power plant.

54
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:58,584
The dome is called the "containment"
and houses the nuclear fuel.

55
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:04,006
Today in "Energy in California,"
we focus on nuclear power...

56
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:08,803
the transformation of matter
into energy, that experts tell us...

57
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:14,225
may be our best shot
at energy selfish sufficient...

58
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:18,062
- What happened?
- She said "selfish sufficiency."

59
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:23,150
- "Self-sufficiency."
- Let's keep going.

60
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,198
This simulated uranium is the exact
size of those used in the fuel rods.

61
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:33,994
This pellet contains more energy
than six carloads of coal.

62
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:42,128
Twenty million pellets are inside
the reactor vessel, here, at the "core."

63
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:46,924
Around the core is water,
which is used as a coolant.

64
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:51,887
Inside here is another set of rods
called the "control rods."

65
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:56,559
They control the nuclear reaction.
What happens is this:

66
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:03,691
When the core is activated,
the control rods are lifted out.

67
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:09,446
The nuclear fuel then sets up a
chain reaction, producing heat.

68
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:14,535
This boils the water,
that turns the turbine...

69
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:19,165
that turns the generator,
that produces electricity.

70
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,042
- That's it.
- That's great.

71
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,172
Let's get a reaction shot
of Kimberly.

72
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:32,178
- You made it seem simple.
- It is. I'll get your hard hats.

73
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,348
- Can you take us inside?
- That's next.

74
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:40,060
- All set, Kimbo?
- Oh, my God.

75
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,606
Get rid of my circles, Richard.

76
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:49,028
- I'll do my best. Let's see.
- Don't you touch my hair.

77
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:52,281
Reaction shot on William Gibson.

78
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,075
Did you get the pellet?

79
00:08:55,285 --> 00:09:00,206
- It's not cheating too much?
- No, a highly complimentary angle.

80
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:06,462
Gibson's talking. Very interested.

81
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,799
Steam turns the turbine,
then the shit hits the fan.

82
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:15,304
Come on, Kimbo, hold it together.
Very good.

83
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:21,227
Uranium, they make bombs out
of that. They didn't mention that.

84
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,939
Wait till you get radiation
all over yourself.

85
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:29,735
- Those pellets will turn you on.
- Mr. Gibson?

86
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:35,449
- You got our hats?
- One size fits all.

87
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:41,622
- Can we film the containment area?
- Not when we're on-line.

88
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,501
- Can I leave my jacket here?
- Fine.

89
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:49,421
That man really does his job.

90
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,092
Don't blow it for me, Richard.

91
00:09:54,636 --> 00:10:00,724
This is coverage, not controversy.
Be a friend?

92
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:04,019
This is the turbine room.

93
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:19,952
Sound rolling.
Ventana Power Plant, take one.

94
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,666
This is a rare chance
to see inside a nuclear power plant.

95
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:32,339
Right here, you can feel the power.
And power is what it's all about.

96
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:36,677
This 800 megawatt plant
makes enough electricity...

97
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,763
for a city of three quarters
of a million people.

98
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:46,645
We're now 50 feet above the turbine
room on an incredible moving crane.

99
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,315
What is this crane used for?

100
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:54,862
We use it to transport heavy pieces
of machinery, hundreds of tons.

101
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,907
- I think it'll support us.
- I hope so.

102
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:04,872
- How many people work here?
- At the present time, 150.

103
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:09,543
- Can they work in this noise?
- What noise? I don't hear it.

104
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:19,720
- What?
- This is 80 feet further down.

105
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:25,142
- Richard? Can you shoot here?
- No way.

106
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,813
Our supervisor, Herman De Young.
Kimberly Wells.

107
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:33,776
- I recognize you.
- Richard Adams, Hector Salas.

108
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:39,198
If I can do anything for you,
let me know.

109
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:45,037
- It's too dark here to film.
- I've got a better idea, anyway.

110
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,375
I think you'll like it.

111
00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:00,761
- Is the containment that way?
- Yes.

112
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:12,106
God, my ears!
How old is this plant?

113
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:17,653
- We came on-line four years ago.
- Isn't another one opening soon?

114
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:22,825
Yeah, we'll license Point Conception
after the safety hearings.

115
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:28,163
They'll make more electricity than
the Hoover Dam and Grand Coulee.

116
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:31,834
Very interesting.

117
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:38,132
Your tongue is black, Richard.
You're contaminated.

118
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:45,722
- This is the control room.
- The brains of the beast.

119
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,477
The glass is bullet-proof
and soundproof.

120
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:55,607
- They're so young.
- It's a young industry.

121
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,319
- I see an older guy.
- Make you feel better?

122
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,156
No, he just looks competent.

123
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:06,034
Ted Spindler's been with the company
for years.

124
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:10,497
I'm sorry, you can't film here,
for security reasons.

125
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:15,002
- Not one shot?
- No. A cold drink?

126
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,881
- No, thank you.
- I'll take one.

127
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,551
- You always work together?
- Yeah.

128
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:28,307
No, we're just doing this together.
I made commercials with these bums.

129
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:33,854
Kimberly's full-time,
but Hector and I are independent.

130
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,398
Very independent.

131
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,740
- What was that?
- It felt like an earthquake.

132
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:11,517
- What have we got? Turbine trip?
- Yeah.

133
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:24,238
- "Generator trip, turbine trip."
- Reactor scram.

134
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:29,034
Okay, we're off the line.
Ted, stabilize the reactor.

135
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:40,546
- Radiation in containment!
- What level?

136
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,591
- Level eight, Jack.
- Okay. Borden, relax.

137
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:49,721
- It must be that safety valve.
- Holt, cut down the pumps.

138
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,684
Barney?
Come here and watch the feedwater.

139
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,144
Holler out the numbers.

140
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,313
Line up the valves.

141
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,649
Turn off that goddamned alarm!

142
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:05,654
How can I give orders in a racket
like that?

143
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,991
Within limits, Ted?

144
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,452
- Systems status?
- Pressure normal.

145
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:16,832
- Jack? Phone for you.
- We still have radiation.

146
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:22,129
- It's normal.
- Feedwater flow is decreasing.

147
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,632
- Godell.
- Bill Gibson here.

148
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,345
We've got some people here
shooting a TV news special.

149
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:35,100
- What the hell's going on?
- It's just a turbine trip.

150
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:41,690
- Nothing to worry about.
- High water level in the reactor!

151
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:49,531
Okay, relax. Everybody relax.
Dump the water.

152
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:54,119
It's just a routine turbine trip.

153
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:58,540
Find out
where that water's coming from.

154
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:04,296
We've got to get rid of it.
Look, Ted.

155
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:09,635
- Barney. Open 14 and 15.
- You can't do that, Jack.

156
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:14,264
- The book says you can't do it.
- We have to.

157
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:27,277
The flashing lights, "enunciators,"
means something needs attention.

158
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:31,698
- Godell says it's routine.
- Are you filming?

159
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:36,703
Godell was a submarine commander.

160
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:43,877
Turbine trips happen now and then.
It means the turbine is shut down.

161
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:50,384
It may be a feedwater leak,
but we can't tell which valve.

162
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,392
- Shut the isolation valves.
- You're gonna need that later.

163
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:02,854
You want to do it by hand? Do it!

164
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:09,403
- Closing isolation valves.
- Please go back to your stations.

165
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:13,699
Jack! Look at this
water level indicator. It's low.

166
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,707
This says it's high.

167
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,462
But that's...

168
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:44,146
Jesus Christ!
Barney, give me feedwater.

169
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,191
Ted, we may uncover the core.

170
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:51,695
Operations.

171
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:58,744
Jack Godell. We have an emergency.
Get everybody into safety areas.

172
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:05,834
All personnel, go to safety areas.
Caution! This is not a drill.

173
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:10,172
We stay here. This is a safety area.

174
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,552
Jesus!

175
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,268
Hurry up, Frank.

176
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,565
Move it!

177
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,984
Routine?

178
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,624
Talk to me, Barney.

179
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:51,505
Only one system is operational.

180
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,548
- Under nine inches.
- Is it holding?

181
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:58,970
- It's dropping.
- We're losing it.

182
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:03,183
My God.
Where's the coolant injection?

183
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:07,521
- It's down for maintenance.
- I don't believe it.

184
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:19,282
- We have to dump pressure.
- You can't take that chance.

185
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:42,305
Borden, let me know exactly
when the LPCI comes in.

186
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:51,898
- Water.
- Eight inches. Still dropping.

187
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,525
Please God, cover it!

188
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:05,912
- Cover it!
- We've got LPCI!

189
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:21,272
It's coming up.

190
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:40,674
- Don't bother with the interviews.
- Just give them the accident.

191
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:46,554
- Did you shoot normal?
- Normal ASA. It'll take 40 minutes.

192
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:53,603
- Mort! We've got a rush.
- There's a film in the machine.

193
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:58,066
- It's hot, do it. Will you wait?
- Go get them.

194
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:03,405
- What is it?
- Dynamite. Nuclear dynamite.

195
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,951
It's about time.

196
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,122
George has already written
the marathon piece.

197
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,542
- How did it go?
- I've got the lead story.

198
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,878
Fine. You'll be on
after the first commercial.

199
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:25,260
Did you hear me? I've got the lead
story. I'll write the script now.

200
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:29,222
An accident at Ventana.
It's all on film.

201
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:35,145
- Why didn't you call in?
- We didn't want to use the phone.

202
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:40,859
- The hostage story is ready.
- Frank, will you check that out?

203
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:45,822
- You want a beeper?
- Call me... No, we'll plan on it.

204
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:50,076
Kimberly, there's nothing
on the wire about an accident.

205
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:54,622
We were in the visitors' gallery
when it happened.

206
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,460
Whatever it was,
they were scared to death.

207
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:03,298
- Richard's got it on film.
- I'd better call Jacovich.

208
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,648
This is the script that goes with it.

209
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:29,491
Hello? Yeah.
Mr. Jacovich? It's for you.

210
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:36,039
Yeah. Who? Okay, I'll be right there.

211
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,545
- Do they know this film exists?
- No.

212
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:46,966
I'm not putting it on until
I find out what's going on.

213
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:51,137
- It's an exclusive!
- It's our best story in months.

214
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:57,018
We don't know exactly what it is.
We have to check our facts first.

215
00:23:57,186 --> 00:24:02,524
- The fact is it happened.
- Put it in the vault. And move it!

216
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,819
Kimberly, you'd better hurry.

217
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:09,489
- I'll talk to you, Richard.
- Yeah, please do.

218
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,328
Gonna open on one, then Camera 2.

219
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:18,832
Places, everyone! Hurry up, Kimberly.

220
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:22,794
Bernie, you want to get me a spritz?

221
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,215
Just a little powder.

222
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:35,390
Stand by, studio. Hurry up, Kimberly.

223
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,769
Ten seconds.

224
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:47,694
Five, four, three, two...

225
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:52,282
Channel 3 Update, California's
most complete newscast.

226
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:57,704
With award-winning anchorman
Pete Martin...

227
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:04,085
and Kimberly Wells
with California Close-up.

228
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:09,132
Good evening. Six people died
in a light-airplane crash...

229
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,468
the social funding bill
may pass...

230
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:16,931
and the FDA have been asked
to ban all food additives.

231
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:23,855
If the license on Point Conception
is delayed, our cash flow dries up.

232
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:28,943
We have debts to every power utility
west of the Rockies.

233
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:34,616
I figure we'll be losing
$492,000 a day.

234
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:40,038
Well, after that, Herman,
you can only bring good news.

235
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:46,002
There's no damage, just cleaning up.
There will be an accident hearing.

236
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:51,090
The NRC is investigating.
Our testimony starts tomorrow.

237
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:56,179
- Can you be back on-line this week?
- If there are no snags.

238
00:25:56,347 --> 00:26:01,267
Herman, I want you to
keep that investigation on track.

239
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:06,022
Be thorough,
make sure everything's all right.

240
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,651
But let's not waste any time.

241
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,862
- Let's get it over with.
- Yes, sir.

242
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:20,787
And for God's sake,
we've had our surprise for the year.

243
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:29,671
Hello? It's Gibson.

244
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,131
Hi, Bill. Yeah?

245
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:38,763
What kind of film? They were where?

246
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:44,269
- Good morning, Kimberly.
- Hi, David.

247
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:50,358
What are you talking about?
I filmed an accident!

248
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:56,114
- In a nuclear power plant.
- Is "accident" the right word?

249
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:59,158
Nice of you to make it.

250
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:03,496
- This station is yellow.
- Obviously, you've made a decision.

251
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:08,459
- Don't start.
- It was just an observation.

252
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:13,923
Listen to this. "Nuclear plants
are security installations..."

253
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:17,885
and as such fall under title 18
of the United States criminal code.

254
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:24,851
"Unauthorized photography is a felony."

255
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:29,355
We're all accessories
just for keeping that film here.

256
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:34,193
Bullshit!
Don't kick me, I won't shut up.

257
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:38,948
Have you seen the official release?
"An unanticipated transient."

258
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:43,745
What the hell is that?
We could have been killed.

259
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:48,041
- Isn't that stretching it a bit?
- You think so?

260
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,835
They say you were never in danger.

261
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:56,341
If you'd been there, you'd find it
hard to believe there was no danger.

262
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,552
Let's show it to an expert.

263
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,390
- It stays in the vault.
- This is all a cover-up.

264
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:08,728
Kimberly told me she saw
you talking to their PR guy, Gibson.

265
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,231
I told him the film
stays in the vault.

266
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:17,028
- Is this a conspiracy?
- It is not a cover-up.

267
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:21,532
- They didn't have to say anything.
- They only did because of us.

268
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:27,747
They did what they should do.
They're holding an investigation.

269
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:33,169
It'll be a fast investigation with
another plant waiting for a license.

270
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:37,256
Calm down.
Who is conducting the investigation?

271
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:41,469
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
We'll get a full report.

272
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:45,807
Then we will decide
what to do with the film.

273
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:50,353
I really don't believe this. I just...

274
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:59,237
- Are you just going to sit here?
- Performers don't make policy.

275
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,989
She's a professional, right?

276
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:07,203
This is a sensitive subject.
We're not going to risk a massive lawsuit.

277
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:13,501
- You're being pressured.
- You're being hysterical, Richard.

278
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:16,712
And you're being
a chickenshit asshole.

279
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,589
Richard.

280
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,262
I'll talk to him.

281
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:34,355
- Why did you do that?
- They really got to you?

282
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:41,446
All we could hope for is that they'd
go for the scoop, but they didn't.

283
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:45,241
And they're right. They'd be sued.

284
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:50,955
I'm not ashamed of having a
good job, and I intend to keep it.

285
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:57,128
If that means they've got me,
then they've got me.

286
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:02,467
You were the one that called me
and asked if I could get you work.

287
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:06,345
- Thank you very much.
- Anytime.

288
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,933
Talk to him later, Kimberly.

289
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:15,646
The van is waiting to take you
to your "Live at Noon" spot.

290
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:20,943
I'm going to the zoo.
It's the tiger's birthday.

291
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:35,082
A faulty relay opened
the generator breakers.

292
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:39,420
The transient in water and pressure
caused the turbine to trip.

293
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:43,007
Relief valve number eight
opened automatically.

294
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:47,553
This shut down the reactor.
A "scram" situation.

295
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:53,392
- But the second shock wave...
- Excuse me.

296
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:57,146
Sir, it's not really a shock wave.

297
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,401
It was more of a shudder.
A vibration.

298
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:06,239
So you were clear in your mind
up to this point?

299
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:18,501
Yes, sir.

300
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:25,424
- The water level began to drop?
- We thought the level was high.

301
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:28,636
The water level recorder was stuck.

302
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:35,643
You began to cut off the feedwater,
thinking the water was too high?

303
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,144
Yes, sir.

304
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:41,774
- But the water was dangerously low?
- Low, yes.

305
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:45,695
Why didn't your operator
look at the other indicators?

306
00:31:56,623 --> 00:32:00,835
I don't know.
I didn't look at it, either.

307
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:20,271
- Jack, how did it go?
- Okay.

308
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:25,818
- What did you tell them?
- I'm not allowed to discuss it.

309
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:30,072
- Mr. Spindler.
- Yeah, right here.

310
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:50,635
- Can I interest you in this?
- In your ear, Pete.

311
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:56,849
Do you know what she's getting?
Two hundred and fifty thou.

312
00:32:57,017 --> 00:33:00,686
- Did you know that?
- She started out doing the weather.

313
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:06,734
Her visual image is perfect.
I like her hair red.

314
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:12,198
We're sitting there.

315
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:21,374
- Puerto what?
- Puerto Vallarta.

316
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:26,420
- How can you afford it?
- Three hundred and sixty-nine dollars.

317
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:30,007
- May I?
- Mr. Jacovich.

318
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:34,845
- Excuse me.
- Enjoying yourself?

319
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:39,892
I saw your zoo piece, it was brilliant.

320
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:43,479
We got a lot of calls.

321
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:47,316
How are you doing
on the energy specials?

322
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:52,071
We just have the beginning
and ending to do. We're editing.

323
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,324
I think you'll be pleased.

324
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:00,037
I want to apologize for Richard.

325
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:05,042
He's difficult sometimes.
But he's the best cameraman I know.

326
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:11,006
- You haven't worked with many.
- Yes, as a matter of fact, I have.

327
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:17,847
If he was on the staff,
I'd fire him. I don't like him.

328
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:22,309
There were no staff crew available
for the specials.

329
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:26,439
And Richard's won awards.

330
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:32,403
Hot-head award, Foul-mouth
award, Can of Worms award.

331
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:36,574
What he said was wrong, I agree.

332
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:41,704
- What will you do with the film?
- The legal hassles have just begun.

333
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:45,958
Don't you worry,
we'll take care of it.

334
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:49,253
- Coffee?
- No, thank you.

335
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:52,882
You just keep doing a good job.

336
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:57,303
Our ratings have gone up
because of you.

337
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:04,977
So Don,
let me do some hard news.

338
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:10,775
You're better with the softer stuff.
You're not an investigator.

339
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,653
Don't try to be anything else.

340
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:21,160
- I love you doing what you do best.
- I'd be good doing news.

341
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:26,248
We'll see.
Let's take a look at the specials.

342
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:32,505
We'll see.
I like your hair like that.

343
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:37,885
Don't stay too late.

344
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:11,377
You lonely old coot.
You want to come inside?

345
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,177
Come and have a little chat with me.

346
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:25,391
Us two girls sitting by the fire.

347
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:31,188
What can I give you?
How about some yucky old lettuce?

348
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:36,694
You must be hungry.

349
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,953
Let's see here.

350
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:53,127
Just you and me, kid.

351
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,632
You want a bath?

352
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:04,430
Hi, it's your mother.
I hate these machines.

353
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:07,433
Call me. Bye-bye.

354
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:16,108
Corrine here. I was going to ask
you to take me to the party.

355
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:20,070
See you there, bye.
How about those ratings!

356
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:27,119
Hi, Kimberly, it's Buck Brewer,
the American Airlines pilot.

357
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:31,332
I'll be here for a couple of days
and I'd love to see you.

358
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,835
Call me if you're in before 11.

359
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,796
Oh, shit.

360
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:42,259
It's your mother again.
Don't forget your father's birthday.

361
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:47,765
He says he doesn't want presents,
but you know him. Call me tomorrow.

362
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:53,604
This is Richard.
You really are an asshole.

363
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:34,353
Ted? Can I see you a sec?

364
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:43,362
I wanted to get your impressions
of one phase here.

365
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:48,450
Just after the turbine trip,
did you feel a vibration?

366
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:52,871
- The steam line closure.
- No, that's here. I mean later.

367
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:58,752
- More of a vibration.
- Right here. It's relief valve 14.

368
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,340
I don't think so.
Didn't they ask you about this?

369
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:09,763
- They asked us not to discuss it.
- That's during the investigation.

370
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:14,810
- Is this part of the investigation?
- What's the matter?

371
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:21,233
I was in there
for twice as long as anyone else.

372
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:25,904
You Navy guys have credentials,
but I'm a 25-year company man.

373
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:29,408
I knew nothing nuclear before.

374
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:35,497
You tell me, where do you think
the axe of "human error" will fall?

375
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,541
Why do you think
they want a scapegoat?

376
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:41,837
Tradition.

377
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:48,010
I'm going to get a cup of coffee.

378
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:57,561
What goes up, must come down,
and that's what happened in Cudahy.

379
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:01,273
Hot-air balloons
are lighter than air...

380
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:05,611
but not lighter than gravity.
So sometimes, they don't fly.

381
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:12,076
William Levin was flying near Cudahy
when his balloon came down.

382
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:17,122
It didn't land in a tree-top.
It wouldn't land on a flat roof.

383
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:20,584
It landed on a camper.

384
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:24,546
There were no injuries,
except wounded pride.

385
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:29,968
But the police held no grudge.
They gave him a ride home. Pete?

386
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:33,806
- Is that your hot-air report?
- You're the expert.

387
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:40,354
I don't know about that.
We'll be back at 6:00.

388
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:46,318
For Kimberly Wells and all of us,
I'm Pete Martin, have a good day.

389
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:50,572
I can't believe what you said!
What about my credibility?

390
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,491
You'll recover.

391
00:40:56,496 --> 00:41:00,791
Kimberly.
Have you seen Richard?

392
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:05,921
Not since yesterday,
but I'll probably see him today. Why?

393
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:11,635
The son of a bitch stole the film.
I just came from the vault.

394
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,847
You brought him in, so it's your neck.

395
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:21,311
Jacovich is away until tomorrow.
I want the film back by then.

396
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:24,773
Okay, Mac. Thanks.

397
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,831
Hey, guys!

398
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:47,880
- Give me a look.
- Where did you get it?

399
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:54,011
- Ted, what's going on?
- It's the preliminary report, Jack.

400
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:59,057
That was fast.

401
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:04,021
Listen: "Personnel responded
swiftly and professionally," et cetera.

402
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:09,568
"While some errors were made
and procedures violated...

403
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:13,822
the overall result was containment
of a potentially costly event."

404
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,994
We're going back on-line tomorrow.

405
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:42,267
In this section of "Energy in
California" we look at solar power.

406
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:46,271
What will it do for our economy
and our environment?

407
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:51,693
Mr. Thurston,
according to a recent study...

408
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:56,114
Richard!

409
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,912
Hector? Where's Richard?

410
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,373
I don't know where he is.

411
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:09,294
He gave me some work to do
and he left.

412
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:15,384
He stole the film from the station.
He's going to get us into trouble.

413
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:20,264
- Where is he, Hector?
- I don't know.

414
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:26,979
You're an observant person. You must
have some idea where he was going.

415
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:30,148
He took the projector and the film.

416
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:35,028
Maybe he went back to the plant
to get someone to explain it.

417
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:37,781
And he calls me an asshole.

418
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:43,078
- Tell him to call and fill me in.
- You're a real mensch.

419
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:57,551
- See you guys.
- Good night.

420
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:37,632
- Is that the girl from Channel 3?
- Yes.

421
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:45,932
- Are you looking for somebody?
- Yes, a friend of mine.

422
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:52,856
Drink? Your friend will show up.
It's the only decent bar around.

423
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:58,779
- That's what I heard.
- Come on, have a drink.

424
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:02,657
- Yeah, I could use a drink.
- Good. Harry?

425
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:06,870
Someone from the plant?
What would you like?

426
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:13,418
- Scotch on the rocks.
- I saw you on the 6. Terrific.

427
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:17,255
- You work at the plant.
- Yes, Jack Godell.

428
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:22,260
This is Alma and Ted Spindler.
Kimberly Wells.

429
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:32,437
- What's all the celebrating?
- We got a clean bill of health.

430
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:37,025
- The investigation's over?
- Why are you so surprised?

431
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:42,155
- I was there. I saw the accident.
- There wasn't any accident.

432
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:45,492
- What was it?
- A faulty relay in the generator.

433
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:49,996
- A what?
- A faulty relay in the generator circuit.

434
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:53,333
- And that's all?
- And a stuck valve.

435
00:45:55,545 --> 00:45:57,921
On the house.

436
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:05,929
- You seemed relieved afterwards.
- There wasn't any accident.

437
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:12,978
When do you start up again?

438
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:16,189
The plant?
Tomorrow or something.

439
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:23,947
Was the investigation so quick
because of Point Conception?

440
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:28,660
Because the same company is trying
to get a license for a new plant?

441
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:37,627
You are here looking for a friend?
You're not trying to get a story?

442
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:44,092
No. I wish I were.
I'm not an investigative reporter.

443
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:47,012
I don't like reporters.

444
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:52,017
Most feel the only good news
is bad news.

445
00:46:52,185 --> 00:46:57,606
And, God,
they give our industry a rough time.

446
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:04,821
Excuse me.
Jack, we'll see you in the morning.

447
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:11,745
Don't you think reporters
serve a public function?

448
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:18,376
Ask me a "public function" question,
and I'll tell you.

449
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,545
All right.

450
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,885
Was the public, at any time,
in danger...?

451
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:30,222
Miss Wells,
could I have your autograph?

452
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:37,437
Oh, my God, it is.
I thought he was kidding.

453
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:42,567
- You look just like you do on TV.
- Who shall I write it to?

454
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:48,198
- Cindy, C-l-N-D-Y.
- Do you know who's here tonight?

455
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:55,038
The most beautiful TV personality,
Miss Kimberly Wells!

456
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:05,590
Unreal. Wait, where were we?

457
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:10,428
You were asking me
a public function question.

458
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:15,141
Was the public in danger
as a result of the accident?

459
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:19,104
I use that word deliberately,
because a good reporter would.

460
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:23,733
Watch out, you'll be on TV.

461
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:31,449
Excuse me. Let's sit there.

462
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:46,339
Let me try to explain something
that people do not understand.

463
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:50,677
These plants are designed
for the possibility of accidents.

464
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:55,015
Everything that could go wrong
was considered.

465
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:59,352
Our quality control
is only equaled by NASA.

466
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:06,484
Every part is tested again and again.
Every weld is radiographed.

467
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:11,656
Everything is checked
and double-checked and re-checked.

468
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:14,367
You haven't answered the question.

469
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:22,834
All right. In everything man does,
there's an element of risk.

470
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:29,924
So we have "defense in depth."
That means two back-up systems.

471
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:34,638
You saw it.
There was no radiation leakage.

472
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:39,684
The system works. Even with
a faulty relay or a stuck valve...

473
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:41,770
that system works.

474
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:47,609
There was no accident.

475
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:56,034
- Can I get you another drink?
- No, thanks. I have to get up early.

476
00:49:56,243 --> 00:50:00,664
I'm covering the migration
of grey whales at Point Mugu.

477
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:10,382
You're halfway there.
Why don't you spend the night...

478
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:13,051
somewhere around here?

479
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:17,764
Then in the morning,
slide over the mountains.

480
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:21,059
No, I have to read so much.

481
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:25,772
- And find your friend.
- And I have to find my friend.

482
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:32,612
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

483
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:35,448
Good night.

484
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:41,913
When you turn on a light,
think 10 percent me.

485
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:45,792
- What?
- That's how much power we supply.

486
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,881
Good night, Miss Wells.

487
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:08,518
You got a map? I'll follow you.

488
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:10,854
Kim.

489
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:15,233
- I talked to Richard.
- Where is he?

490
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:19,779
He said if you want the film,
he's at Point Conception.

491
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:22,532
Some big demonstration.

492
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,454
You've got great timing.

493
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:31,749
Hang on,
we may change our plans.

494
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:37,922
Get me Mac.

495
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:42,343
Marty, Jim.
Get a crew to clean this up.

496
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:46,723
Rusty, go over this pump.

497
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:51,603
Check every seal, every rivet and nut.

498
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:54,939
I want a full report
after every shift, okay?

499
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:58,026
Let's go, Jack. We've got to talk.

500
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:06,910
- That could be very, very serious.
- What the hell are we going to do?

501
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:11,164
- Tear the pump down and inspect it.
- We can't do that.

502
00:54:11,332 --> 00:54:14,459
We'd be down for two weeks.

503
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:19,631
- The leak must be in a pump seal.
- You don't know that.

504
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:24,218
- We tighten the seals and test it.
- How will we really find...?

505
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:28,306
TV monitors
might tell us what's happening.

506
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,476
They might tell us what's happening.

507
00:54:31,644 --> 00:54:36,189
Get on top of this, Jack.
Test it as soon as possible.

508
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:38,566
I have to call them.

509
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:43,738
I said we'd be back on-line by 3:00.

510
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:57,669
To the Atomic Safety Board:
These are pictures of our children.

511
00:54:57,836 --> 00:55:04,676
They cannot be here, so we ask you
to consider them in your decision.

512
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:07,178
They are the ones who will inherit...

513
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:12,100
the consequences of your actions.
And now the names of the children.

514
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:17,730
Ronald Borsak, 5 years old.
Tony Bulotti, 7.

515
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:22,110
Robert Grimble, 1 and a half.
Douglas Brown, 2.

516
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,404
Arnold Kelsey, 14.

517
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:30,159
Ernest Chullet, 10. Dean Smith, 12.
Juan Garcia, 3.

518
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:34,914
Lonnie Lewis, Scott Lewis, 12.
Blake Holtfield, 2.

519
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:39,002
Eric Jones, 5. Steven Lang, 13.

520
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:43,256
- Richard!
- I have to talk to this lady.

521
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:48,803
Did you miss me?

522
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:56,936
Unbelievable! Where have you been?
Where's the film?

523
00:55:57,104 --> 00:56:00,857
If you don't get it back,
Jacovich will call the cops.

524
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:04,068
Come on,
I want to show you something.

525
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:07,989
- I'm working.
- I'm in room E309.

526
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:12,076
- I need that film.
- I understand. E309, all right?

527
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:14,787
You wait for me.

528
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:24,881
- They'll be in the background?
- Yeah. Over there.

529
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:30,636
Here?
Them, and a two-shot with me?

530
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:35,933
How much time do we have?
The sun will be in my eyes.

531
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:41,314
- Who have you got for me?
- This man's pro-nuke.

532
00:56:41,482 --> 00:56:47,361
Okay, we're going with the red-head
for a whale story, right?

533
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:53,076
What's she doing? A nuclear story?
Hard news? Okay, I'll handle it.

534
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:57,705
Now here's Kimberly Wells
at Point Conception.

535
00:56:57,873 --> 00:57:02,960
- I'm speaking with Al Baietti...
- I hope Jacovich isn't watching.

536
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,630
I believe that means
you have particular concern...

537
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:09,467
about health and safety measures
and nuclear energy, is that correct?

538
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:13,763
Studio control. One moment, please.

539
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:17,517
Mr. Jacovich.

540
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:20,436
Hi, Don.

541
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:26,359
I want the cameras here,
here, and here.

542
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:31,405
Stuart, I need somebody
in the generator room.

543
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:34,575
We run a pump test at 1300.
What is that?

544
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:40,248
Demonstrators at Point Conception.
Watch, Jack. They're unbelievable.

545
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:43,501
Hazel Washburn. I'm a housewife.

546
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:47,630
I have six grandchildren,
two of whom are here.

547
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:52,468
I'm protesting because I'm
frightened of nuclear energy.

548
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:58,141
How will you keep
your grandkids warm?

549
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:02,979
What do we do
in case of an accident?

550
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:08,776
How can we be absolutely sure the
waste disposal is taken care of?

551
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:12,780
- We still go on-line at 3?
- According to De Young.

552
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:29,422
- Who is it?
- Kimberly.

553
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:34,343
This is the lady I told you about.

554
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:38,097
- You can't show this.
- Wait, listen to them.

555
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:44,520
That guy is a physics professor,
and the other is a nuclear engineer.

556
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:48,191
You can stop it here.

557
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,653
I thought we'd better show you.
What do you think?

558
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:56,407
I think you're
probably lucky to be alive.

559
00:58:56,575 --> 00:59:00,119
And the same goes
for all of Southern California.

560
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:16,344
- Steady as a rock.
- Ted, go to 110.

561
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:20,932
Wait a minute.
We're at the top of the scale.

562
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:25,353
It can go up to 110. We'll watch it here.

563
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:34,695
Okay, go ahead.

564
00:59:34,863 --> 00:59:37,782
Take it to 110.

565
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:14,318
The seals are holding. Shut it off
and go back on-line as planned.

566
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:21,993
Leave it there a minute.

567
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:45,224
In a reactor scram, the system
works automatically for 10 minutes.

568
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:51,188
They obviously have a problem.
Could you stop it there?

569
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:57,111
- They're doing it manually.
- It's a stuck valve.

570
01:00:57,279 --> 01:01:00,906
- How do you know?
- I was there last night.

571
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:05,244
I talked to Jack Godell.
He said it was a stuck valve.

572
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:09,248
- You talked to him last night?
- That's right.

573
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:14,670
The stuck valve is forcing them to
deal with the reactor water level.

574
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:17,757
It looks serious.

575
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:20,551
In the control room...

576
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:26,015
these lights are concerned
with core water level.

577
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:31,103
They might have come close
to exposing the core.

578
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:35,900
If that's true, we came very close
to the China Syndrome.

579
01:01:36,068 --> 01:01:42,782
If the core is exposed,
the fuel heats up in a matter of minutes.

580
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:49,205
Nothing stops it. It melts through
the ground, theoretically to China.

581
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:55,169
But when it hits ground water,
it explodes into radioactive clouds.

582
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:58,839
The number killed
depends on the wind.

583
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:05,888
A vast area would be uninhabitable,
with many cancer cases later.

584
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,779
ED8.

585
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:22,488
D8. R6.

586
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:40,759
Perfect.

587
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:02,361
And perfect.

588
01:03:45,197 --> 01:03:48,657
"D.B. Royce."

589
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:52,620
Herman, we've got a serious problem.

590
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:56,916
- The pump checked out.
- Those tests tell us nothing.

591
01:03:57,083 --> 01:04:01,378
My God, Jack,
you ran it up to 110 percent.

592
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:07,092
That won't tell us what will happen
if we scram at full power again.

593
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:12,473
Any sudden shock...
Goddamn it, listen to me! Just once.

594
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:19,730
I'm sorry.
I went through the quality reports.

595
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:24,818
There were irregularities
in the contractor's documentation.

596
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:28,489
So I checked the welding X-rays.

597
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,368
Here's a sample.

598
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:37,122
They're identical.
It's the same picture over and over.

599
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:42,211
Jack, no contractor can supply
every stupid document.

600
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:46,757
They cheated a bit, so what?
These X-rays are six years old.

601
01:04:46,925 --> 01:04:50,678
- So are the welds.
- For God's sake, Jack...

602
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,806
Listen to me.

603
01:04:54,558 --> 01:05:00,271
- We need new radiographs.
- What? That's absurd.

604
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:05,568
It would take a long time,
and cost 15 to 20 million dollars.

605
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:12,157
We've got to get back on-line today.
The company's losing a fortune.

606
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:13,951
Start her up, Jack.

607
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:46,900
Borden, get some service
water samples for health analysis.

608
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:50,446
- Yes, sir.
- Barney, did you check the pumps?

609
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:55,117
Yes. Flow and temperatures are okay.

610
01:05:55,327 --> 01:05:58,329
The valve at station 47 is clear.

611
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:02,750
How are you coming, Jack?
It's almost 3:00.

612
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:06,712
Reactor on stand-by.
Turbine on turning gear.

613
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,089
All right.

614
01:06:16,014 --> 01:06:17,181
Load dispatch.

615
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:22,728
Load dispatch, this is Ventana.
Approaching power, normal procedure.

616
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:26,732
I'll contact you to synchronize
the generator.

617
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:31,070
We'll be back on the grid soon.

618
01:06:34,366 --> 01:06:37,159
We've got a clear board, Jack.

619
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:46,418
We've got a clear board.

620
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:11,568
Follow normal sequence
for rod withdrawal.

621
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:22,955
Group one.

622
01:07:29,421 --> 01:07:31,547
Group three.

623
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:38,512
Group five.

624
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:45,018
Group seven.

625
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,773
Group two.

626
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,695
Group four.

627
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:25,559
- Get these films developed.
- Mr. Royce?

628
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:31,607
- Can I speak to you for a minute?
- Sure.

629
01:08:35,987 --> 01:08:42,117
- I'm a shift supervisor at Ventana.
- What can I do for you?

630
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:48,081
- We had a problem at the plant.
- But everything checked out fine.

631
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:51,668
- You're going back on the line?
- Yes.

632
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:56,423
- Did you sign for these X-rays?
- Yes. What about it?

633
01:08:57,675 --> 01:09:01,345
- You kept signing the same one.
- The welds are fine.

634
01:09:01,513 --> 01:09:04,264
- How do you know?
- Every weld I checked was fine.

635
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:07,810
- How many didn't you check?
- They're fine.

636
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:12,606
- But the plant may not be safe.
- It's perfectly safe.

637
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:18,028
I don't have the time to go through
every goddamn X-ray.

638
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:22,533
- How many? Which ones?
- I don't remember.

639
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:26,286
- There's plenty more.
- You know the procedures.

640
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:31,458
There's no problem.
The welds will hold for 6000 years.

641
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:35,546
- I'll go to the NRC.
- Wait, think it over!

642
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:40,092
You're talking about
a billion-dollar lawsuit.

643
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:45,222
Wait, slow down!
Don't make trouble for yourself.

644
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:51,353
This isn't some piss-ant company,
this is Foster and Sullivan.

645
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:57,401
They've got their own security men.
Do I have to spell it out?

646
01:09:57,569 --> 01:10:02,823
Wait!
They have their own security men!

647
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:06,869
Redman!

648
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,626
We've got a problem.

649
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:18,422
- The whales will be there tomorrow.
- It was scheduled.

650
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:23,760
We advertised it.
I want to see her. And you too.

651
01:11:06,638 --> 01:11:08,555
Who is it?

652
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:14,394
It's Kimberly Wells.
I need to talk to you.

653
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:19,483
This is my cameraman.

654
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:23,487
- You lied.
- It was a stuck valve.

655
01:11:23,655 --> 01:11:26,823
- It was not.
- I filmed that accident.

656
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:33,664
I showed it to a nuclear engineer.
You almost uncovered the core.

657
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:41,338
We won't leave
before you tell us what happened.

658
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:48,637
Some nut told you we almost
uncovered the core, but we didn't.

659
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:54,351
The system works.
That's not the problem.

660
01:11:58,523 --> 01:12:01,984
If that's not the problem, what is?

661
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:21,128
I love that plant. It's my whole life.

662
01:12:23,631 --> 01:12:27,092
- What is the problem?
- The shudder.

663
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:32,472
The vibration I felt
during the turbine trip.

664
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:39,312
No one else was worried.
I found that some idiot...

665
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,858
phonied the welding X-rays.

666
01:12:43,026 --> 01:12:48,739
How can someone falsify
the records of a nuclear reactor?

667
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:57,456
- Holy shit.
- The plant's not safe.

668
01:12:57,623 --> 01:13:04,629
The vibration was a warning.
It should be shut down and X-rayed.

669
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:09,968
But that means millions of dollars,
so we don't want to talk about that.

670
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:13,889
And no one will believe me.

671
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:18,769
But if they ever put too much
pressure on that pump...

672
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:24,691
- If they rupture those pipes...
- It's the China Syndrome?

673
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:29,029
That's possible.

674
01:13:37,497 --> 01:13:41,541
Would you go on television
and tell the public?

675
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:45,754
When I said I'd go to the NRC,
a man threatened my life.

676
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:51,384
- Who?
- A bastard at the building company.

677
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:58,475
The same company that built
Point Conception.

678
01:13:58,643 --> 01:14:04,022
If I gave you those X-rays, could you
get them shown at the hearings?

679
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:07,901
- Lowell will present them.
- He'll do it?

680
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:14,658
I'll try to get the station to send
me there, so it gets on the air.

681
01:14:14,826 --> 01:14:17,410
Richard, I'm late.

682
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:20,497
I'll call you
to work out the transfer.

683
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:27,295
I can't give them to you.
Get me someone you trust.

684
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:32,175
- Don't leave here.
- Call me later.

685
01:14:36,848 --> 01:14:40,267
- Stand by, commercial.
- Roll V1.

686
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:45,856
Five, four, three, two, one. Fade up.

687
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:50,610
- Where's Tasha?
- Tell Tasha we'd like to see her.

688
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:54,197
Tell her to hurry up.

689
01:14:58,578 --> 01:15:01,246
Boy, is that hot!

690
01:15:02,373 --> 01:15:06,459
Hello? No, she never showed up.

691
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:10,505
- Thirty seconds.
- Stand by.

692
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:19,306
Camera two, is that as wide as
you can get? Okay, lock it down.

693
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:22,309
Fifteen seconds, quiet please.

694
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:28,481
- Come to your wide shot.
- V1, set for your next piece.

695
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:31,735
- She's here!
- Tell her to hurry.

696
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:40,160
- Kimberly just walked in.
- Five, four, three, two...

697
01:15:40,328 --> 01:15:44,080
This is Channel Three Update...

698
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:48,001
So nice of you to drop by.

699
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:51,213
Cutting it a little close, Kimberly.

700
01:15:51,422 --> 01:15:56,343
And Kimberly Wells.
And now, Pete Martin.

701
01:15:56,510 --> 01:16:02,057
Good evening. There's been a
bombing in the Middle East...

702
01:16:04,769 --> 01:16:11,316
- When am I on?
- What the hell is going on?

703
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:16,821
- Get Jacovich, I have a story.
- Richard, I want that film.

704
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:22,494
- Kiss my ass.
- You'll get the film. Get Jacovich.

705
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:29,501
Winds of up to 100 mph.
A storm-related death was reported.

706
01:16:29,669 --> 01:16:34,172
We'll get the X-rays to you
tomorrow by noon.

707
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:38,510
You're not doing it. It's not your job.

708
01:16:38,678 --> 01:16:41,930
Not as you define it.

709
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:46,351
But I'm tired of birthdays
with tigers and lions.

710
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:50,230
- It's my story, I'll do it.
- Who's the guy at the plant?

711
01:16:50,398 --> 01:16:55,610
- He has to be anonymous.
- Lowell will submit the evidence.

712
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:59,239
Elliot Lowell is not objective.

713
01:16:59,407 --> 01:17:05,662
If you don't want it, someone will.
Some stations like hard news.

714
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:14,462
Crossing in three, two, one...
Up two, cue Pete.

715
01:17:14,672 --> 01:17:19,217
Now it's time for Kimberly Wells.
What do you have for us tonight?

716
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:23,763
From Burbank, a veterinarian
who makes house calls on sick fish.

717
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:27,142
Or is it aquarium calls?

718
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:32,981
He says owners should try
to think like fish.

719
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:38,486
Then when it's time to change
the water, they'll just know.

720
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:44,117
The doctor offers classes ranging
from fin congestion and tail rot...

721
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:49,414
to pop-eye and bladder bloat.
The most common fish ailment?

722
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:54,169
People problems. Dirty hands
and cigarette ashes in the tank.

723
01:17:54,378 --> 01:17:58,798
- I guess no one's immune.
- It's quite a service.

724
01:18:46,764 --> 01:18:49,974
To the Atomic Safety Board
and the public:

725
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:53,478
I speak for my friends,
who choose not to speak.

726
01:18:53,646 --> 01:18:57,774
These hearings do not hear
public sentiment.

727
01:18:57,942 --> 01:19:04,489
The NRC has held 60 hearings,
and not a license has been refused.

728
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:08,660
We are proceeding to build
nuclear plants...

729
01:19:08,828 --> 01:19:13,206
yet we have no program
for the disposal of nuclear waste.

730
01:19:27,346 --> 01:19:30,932
Any further words are pointless.

731
01:19:57,168 --> 01:20:01,254
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

732
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:03,256
You think it's the film?

733
01:20:05,301 --> 01:20:08,094
Your five minutes are up.

734
01:20:12,183 --> 01:20:14,684
Dr. Elliot Lowell.

735
01:20:15,686 --> 01:20:18,146
Mr. Chairman?

736
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:27,989
I'm expecting some information
which will arrive shortly.

737
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:32,160
- I'd appreciate a delay.
- Granted.

738
01:20:55,518 --> 01:21:01,481
What the hell are you doing?
What are you doing?

739
01:21:04,777 --> 01:21:05,902
Hey, man!

740
01:21:07,321 --> 01:21:08,655
What the hell are you doing?

741
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:10,365
Hey!

742
01:21:13,661 --> 01:21:15,453
Hey, man!

743
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:43,022
I am also concerned about the
misinformation about nuclear waste.

744
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:47,694
Much is made of the fact
that this waste is radioactive...

745
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:53,283
and therefore there is some
special problem produced by it.

746
01:21:53,450 --> 01:22:00,123
One hears that it is necessary
to wait centuries before it is safe.

747
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:09,882
Channel 3, KXLA Los Angeles.

748
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:25,148
- Yes?
- It's Kimberly.

749
01:22:25,316 --> 01:22:28,568
- Did you meet Hector?
- A couple of hours ago.

750
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:33,740
- He's not here. You must help us.
- What?

751
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:36,784
You've got to testify.

752
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:40,496
- I understand.
- Please hurry.

753
01:22:46,587 --> 01:22:49,088
My God.

754
01:23:11,195 --> 01:23:17,075
- Ask if they've heard from Hector.
- Jim, see if Hector's checked in.

755
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:29,420
Thank you for the opportunity
to put this on record.

756
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:35,885
Dr. Lowell?
Has your information arrived?

757
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:42,058
- Could I request another hour?
- We have a very busy agenda.

758
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:47,355
We'll schedule you for another day.
We'll now take a 20-minute recess.

759
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:50,024
I'll be downtown.

760
01:23:50,192 --> 01:23:56,823
The Highway Patrol called. Hector's
been in an accident on Highway 6.

761
01:23:56,990 --> 01:24:02,370
- What?
- Hector's been in an accident.

762
01:24:05,332 --> 01:24:09,711
Hector's been in an accident.
He's on Highway 6.

763
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:12,630
Make sure Godell's on the agenda.

764
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:52,206
- Jesus, Mr. Godell.
- Sorry.

765
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:56,919
He'll get shot
driving up here like that.

766
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:05,136
What the hell is that?
What's going on?

767
01:27:05,304 --> 01:27:09,056
Don't fight it. Okay.

768
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:12,935
Ready? Cover up his face.

769
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:49,388
Hector!

770
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,770
- Is he alive?
- Yes, he'll be all right.

771
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:59,982
It's okay, he's going to make it.

772
01:28:04,947 --> 01:28:08,908
- Herman?
- I can't hear.

773
01:28:09,076 --> 01:28:12,954
- How high will you be going?
- Are you drunk?

774
01:28:20,921 --> 01:28:22,880
Spindler?

775
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:26,842
Hi, Jack.

776
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:35,351
Okay, I'll take care of it.

777
01:28:38,939 --> 01:28:43,275
- How high are we?
- We'll have full power by midnight.

778
01:28:43,443 --> 01:28:48,531
- No, we can't risk another scram!
- Have you been drinking?

779
01:28:48,699 --> 01:28:52,493
What?
There may be a defect in the pump.

780
01:28:52,661 --> 01:28:57,248
- I've got my orders.
- There was a vibration!

781
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:07,591
Ted, a sudden surge
could kick that off again.

782
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:15,725
Go home.

783
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:19,395
Why don't you just go home?

784
01:29:24,526 --> 01:29:27,570
- What's the matter with Jack?
- I don't know.

785
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:39,081
- Where are we at?
- Seventy-five percent of full power.

786
01:29:42,544 --> 01:29:47,590
- Take it up to 93 percent.
- All right.

787
01:29:55,098 --> 01:29:58,476
- Leave it there, Jim.
- Jesus Christ, Jack!

788
01:29:59,478 --> 01:30:03,814
Just get out. Go on. Get out.

789
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:06,192
Get out!

790
01:30:08,779 --> 01:30:12,531
- You can't do this, Jack.
- I mean it, Ted.

791
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:17,078
Get out. Everybody, out.

792
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:17,721
It's all right, Hector. Hang on.

793
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:20,224
Easy.

794
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:44,165
- Have you come to finish him off?
- We had nothing to do with this.

795
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:47,084
I must talk to Kimberly.

796
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:51,505
Godell took over the control room.
He wants to talk to you.

797
01:31:51,715 --> 01:31:55,426
Someone's tampering
with the security circuits.

798
01:31:55,594 --> 01:32:00,973
If they don't stop,
I'll flood the containment area.

799
01:32:01,141 --> 01:32:06,228
- You understand?
- Ted. He knows.

800
01:32:19,409 --> 01:32:24,205
- We must find another way in there.
- And fast.

801
01:32:24,414 --> 01:32:29,251
Thank you for coming.
I hope you can convince him to come out.

802
01:32:43,892 --> 01:32:48,354
- Kimberly's here.
- Bring her down. Alone.

803
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:53,943
He wants you to go down alone.

804
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:21,095
Bill, step out where I can see you.

805
01:33:21,263 --> 01:33:26,016
Kimberly, when you hear the bolts,
come in alone.

806
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:29,144
Go ahead.

807
01:33:52,377 --> 01:33:54,795
What happened to your friend?

808
01:33:56,006 --> 01:33:58,924
- There was an accident.
- No accident.

809
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:06,140
- I know. The radiographs are gone.
- Those bastards.

810
01:34:06,308 --> 01:34:09,476
They chased me, so I came here.

811
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:13,647
But the idiots want full power.
It can't take that.

812
01:34:13,815 --> 01:34:17,276
- What will you do?
- What I was going to do.

813
01:34:17,444 --> 01:34:22,406
You'll interview me on TV. Here. Now.

814
01:34:27,078 --> 01:34:30,789
Can I talk to my cameraman up there?

815
01:34:39,174 --> 01:34:40,716
He wants an interview.

816
01:34:40,884 --> 01:34:44,511
You have to talk him out of it.

817
01:34:44,721 --> 01:34:47,723
We've managed to keep it quiet...

818
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:52,728
but if anyone knows,
there'll be a SWAT team here.

819
01:34:55,231 --> 01:34:59,068
Get him to come out,
and we'll listen to him.

820
01:34:59,986 --> 01:35:02,529
No one will get hurt.

821
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:09,745
Don't mess around. He said,
either he makes a public statement...

822
01:35:09,913 --> 01:35:12,498
or he'll flood the containment
with radiation.

823
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:18,545
- Can he do that?
- Yes. He can just open the valves.

824
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:23,425
He can do anything he wants.
But if he floods the containment...

825
01:35:23,593 --> 01:35:27,221
you may as well bury this place.

826
01:35:31,101 --> 01:35:34,436
We'll do it. He can go on the air.

827
01:35:34,604 --> 01:35:38,816
- Mr. McCormack...
- Shut up, Gibson.

828
01:35:40,235 --> 01:35:43,737
Joe, keep an eye on this gentleman.

829
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:56,250
They agreed.
But I won't just call your station.

830
01:35:56,418 --> 01:36:02,005
- I'll call every TV station in L.A.
- They agreed.

831
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:05,926
I can't take responsibility for this.

832
01:36:06,094 --> 01:36:11,098
Should we let him wreck
a billion-dollar investment?

833
01:36:11,266 --> 01:36:14,685
It'll take the press an hour
to get here.

834
01:36:14,853 --> 01:36:20,858
- Don't count on it.
- I expect you to take care of them.

835
01:36:21,818 --> 01:36:27,781
- You do your job, and I'll do mine.
- Yes, sir.

836
01:36:28,825 --> 01:36:31,910
What's holding you people up?

837
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:37,666
You spent a fortune on security
to prevent entry to the control room.

838
01:36:37,834 --> 01:36:43,088
Don't tell me what you can't do.
Tell me what you can do.

839
01:36:43,256 --> 01:36:45,591
We could scram the plant.

840
01:36:45,758 --> 01:36:52,222
If we can do it without him knowing,
it'll distract him while we get in.

841
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:58,520
- Can you do it without him knowing?
- We can sure as hell try.

842
01:37:07,697 --> 01:37:10,032
Scram the son of a bitch.

843
01:37:22,378 --> 01:37:25,923
No, Tom, that won't work.

844
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:37,142
Who's the man standing up there?

845
01:37:38,603 --> 01:37:41,146
McCormack, chairman of the board.

846
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:56,537
- Are we in danger?
- I brought it down to 75 percent.

847
01:37:57,872 --> 01:38:02,751
- Why don't you just shut it down?
- Then I'd lose power.

848
01:38:02,919 --> 01:38:05,295
If we're on-line, I'm a threat.

849
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:25,524
Look. If we take over the generator,
we can cause a turbine trip.

850
01:38:25,692 --> 01:38:32,656
- That will make the reactor scram.
- That's what spooked him, a scram.

851
01:38:32,824 --> 01:38:36,827
Whose side are you on?
You want to give him a hand?

852
01:38:38,454 --> 01:38:44,334
- How long will it take?
- I have to bridge a dozen circuits.

853
01:38:44,502 --> 01:38:50,132
They all terminate here.
Maybe 30 minutes, maybe an hour.

854
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:53,218
Okay, get started.

855
01:39:21,748 --> 01:39:28,253
I'll start with an introduction
to explain where we are.

856
01:39:28,421 --> 01:39:30,714
Then I'll introduce you.

857
01:39:30,882 --> 01:39:37,512
You should say who you are
and how long you've worked here.

858
01:39:38,514 --> 01:39:41,308
Have you thought about
what you'll say?

859
01:39:48,733 --> 01:39:50,317
You want a cup of coffee?

860
01:39:51,611 --> 01:39:53,195
Yeah.

861
01:40:14,175 --> 01:40:15,967
You want cream and sugar?

862
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:33,151
Agent four, over.

863
01:40:34,696 --> 01:40:37,989
Level six, report in.

864
01:41:09,689 --> 01:41:13,400
It's going to be fine.

865
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:30,917
Agent 14,
report to the staging area.

866
01:41:35,131 --> 01:41:38,884
Tell McCormack
the police cars are arriving.

867
01:41:41,262 --> 01:41:44,681
Hey, right here!

868
01:41:45,558 --> 01:41:47,267
Come on.

869
01:41:48,144 --> 01:41:50,604
Right here.

870
01:41:58,654 --> 01:42:02,949
Kimberly's in there?
You'll take a crew in with you?

871
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:08,872
Just like I did it before.
We'll get sound from the intercom.

872
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:13,752
- Use all the available light.
- Can I ask you some questions?

873
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:19,216
- Let's go.
- Are we on the air right now?

874
01:42:19,383 --> 01:42:23,136
We have nothing to say right now.
Just be patient.

875
01:42:28,267 --> 01:42:33,814
- Can you give us his name?
- Godell.

876
01:42:34,023 --> 01:42:38,652
Is this a SWAT team being deployed?

877
01:42:43,741 --> 01:42:47,828
What the hell is a SWAT team
doing here?

878
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:55,126
- Is he armed up there?
- There are rumors.

879
01:42:55,294 --> 01:43:00,715
Have your men follow me
up the back elevator, okay?

880
01:43:15,398 --> 01:43:21,027
- GB3, 17.
- No, that's a front circuit panel.

881
01:43:31,914 --> 01:43:36,501
Studio B, this is remote with
tone and bars. Do you copy?

882
01:43:37,837 --> 01:43:39,629
We've got tone and bars.

883
01:43:40,089 --> 01:43:46,219
We have bars.
Give us picture as soon as you can.

884
01:43:46,387 --> 01:43:51,057
- Video, can you get camera two?
- We can go at any time.

885
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:55,395
- This is irresponsible.
- I can't hear you, Gibson.

886
01:44:00,902 --> 01:44:03,570
They're here.

887
01:44:10,786 --> 01:44:15,248
Bobby, set up on sticks here.

888
01:44:19,295 --> 01:44:22,839
David, a two-shot at the console.

889
01:44:23,007 --> 01:44:26,676
Ron, take sound from this speaker.

890
01:44:35,603 --> 01:44:40,273
Okay, we made it.
The press is everywhere.

891
01:44:40,483 --> 01:44:44,945
Let's just work out the sound,
and we're ready. All right?

892
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:48,657
- What?
- It'll be a few minutes.

893
01:44:48,824 --> 01:44:52,452
Stay clear of the TV monitor.

894
01:44:55,122 --> 01:44:59,250
There are two doors,
locked from the inside.

895
01:45:01,754 --> 01:45:03,880
Get De Young.

896
01:45:04,048 --> 01:45:09,219
- How do you turn on the speaker?
- Right here, that button.

897
01:45:09,387 --> 01:45:12,347
- Do it.
- Lock it open?

898
01:45:12,515 --> 01:45:16,017
You all set? Give us a voice level.

899
01:45:16,185 --> 01:45:19,562
Testing, one, two, three, four.

900
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:29,197
- Move closer to the speaker.
- Testing, this is Kimberly Wells.

901
01:45:29,365 --> 01:45:32,867
Get a little closer together.

902
01:45:33,035 --> 01:45:38,540
- What's next?
- TB 46, a ground wire.

903
01:45:38,708 --> 01:45:41,710
- TB 39, a ground wire.
- Nearly ready.

904
01:45:47,508 --> 01:45:48,967
We've got picture.

905
01:45:52,346 --> 01:45:57,017
Pete to the phone, please.
We're getting close.

906
01:45:57,184 --> 01:46:00,353
Just checking levels.

907
01:46:02,148 --> 01:46:06,359
Hold up something white
for color test.

908
01:46:08,070 --> 01:46:11,865
- Okay?
- He's setting color balance.

909
01:46:12,033 --> 01:46:14,576
Let's get the show on the road.

910
01:46:14,744 --> 01:46:18,204
Stand by.

911
01:46:18,414 --> 01:46:22,000
When the red light comes on,
you're on the air.

912
01:46:22,168 --> 01:46:27,422
Goddamn it, do something.
He's about to go on the air.

913
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:30,341
Okay, David? Stand by, let's go.

914
01:46:33,596 --> 01:46:35,889
Spindler?

915
01:46:36,098 --> 01:46:40,477
We're almost ready. I'll call you.

916
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:43,104
Do something.

917
01:46:46,358 --> 01:46:51,780
Camera one.
Stand by, camera two. Go, Pete.

918
01:46:51,947 --> 01:46:55,909
This is Pete Martin.
We interrupt our programming...

919
01:46:57,286 --> 01:47:00,997
- power plant, where an employee...
- And is demanding to make...

920
01:47:02,708 --> 01:47:04,042
exclusive live coverage...

921
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:09,172
This is Kimberly Wells.

922
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:14,260
I'm in the control room
of Ventana Nuclear Power Plant.

923
01:47:14,428 --> 01:47:18,932
With me is Jack Godell,
who has taken over the plant...

924
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:24,187
and has demanded
to make a statement. Mr. Godell?

925
01:47:27,149 --> 01:47:33,279
I'm a shift supervisor,
I've been here since it opened.

926
01:47:33,447 --> 01:47:36,074
I don't want to hurt anybody...

927
01:47:36,242 --> 01:47:40,787
or contaminate California.

928
01:47:40,955 --> 01:47:43,706
I just want you to...

929
01:47:45,376 --> 01:47:50,463
Monday last, at 3:36 p. m...

930
01:47:50,631 --> 01:47:53,341
we had an event happen...

931
01:47:53,509 --> 01:47:56,594
We had an accident.

932
01:47:56,762 --> 01:48:00,890
- Jesus Christ.
- Nobody was hurt.

933
01:48:01,058 --> 01:48:05,436
It was more serious than you'll
ever know. It was human error.

934
01:48:05,604 --> 01:48:11,234
A faulty relay caused the generator
breakers to trip.

935
01:48:11,402 --> 01:48:17,157
- Don't be technical!
- I know it sounds ridiculous...

936
01:48:20,744 --> 01:48:26,624
That's the reactor water level.
The pen in the meter got stuck.

937
01:48:26,792 --> 01:48:30,795
Because of that,
we got the wrong reading.

938
01:48:31,005 --> 01:48:36,092
We tried to keep water out.

939
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:41,097
But in fact the level
was dangerously low.

940
01:48:41,265 --> 01:48:48,396
We only had one auxiliary pump left
to get water into the core.

941
01:48:48,564 --> 01:48:52,400
- Come on.
- But that's not why I'm here.

942
01:48:52,568 --> 01:48:56,196
- I'm not making sense.
- It's all right.

943
01:48:58,908 --> 01:49:02,285
There's something else. You see...

944
01:49:02,453 --> 01:49:06,581
- We got it.
- Ready to cut the circuit.

945
01:49:06,749 --> 01:49:12,754
It's so complex, yet it's simple.

946
01:49:12,922 --> 01:49:18,384
It's so complex, this whole place.
It's very difficult.

947
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:22,055
But that's not why I'm...

948
01:49:22,223 --> 01:49:26,643
The vibration was not normal.

949
01:49:26,852 --> 01:49:31,731
There was a vibration. I know.

950
01:49:31,899 --> 01:49:34,943
Do it, for Christ's sake.

951
01:49:40,950 --> 01:49:45,536
Oh, no. No!

952
01:49:48,499 --> 01:49:51,542
- Cut him off.
- We're losing picture.

953
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:54,629
What happened?

954
01:49:54,797 --> 01:50:00,885
Oh, my God, why? You idiots!

955
01:50:07,184 --> 01:50:10,770
- He's gone nuts.
- We've lost our picture.

956
01:50:10,938 --> 01:50:15,358
Please, God, no!

957
01:50:25,911 --> 01:50:28,705
Stop!

958
01:50:38,799 --> 01:50:41,467
Stop it!

959
01:50:43,512 --> 01:50:46,097
Check the feedwater.

960
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:49,892
- Get a doctor.
- Get a medic!

961
01:51:18,547 --> 01:51:21,758
I can feel it.

962
01:51:22,551 --> 01:51:25,595
- What did he say?
- "I feel it."

963
01:51:37,649 --> 01:51:40,443
My God, it's that pump.

964
01:51:40,611 --> 01:51:46,074
- Check feedwater valves!
- Stabilize the reactor.

965
01:51:46,241 --> 01:51:48,493
Stay at your stations!

966
01:52:30,327 --> 01:52:31,786
Damn it, shut up!

967
01:52:38,877 --> 01:52:40,545
Christ.

968
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:25,047
It's over.

969
01:53:26,049 --> 01:53:27,175
It's stable.

970
01:53:51,074 --> 01:53:54,911
If you've just tuned in,
what happened was this:

971
01:53:55,078 --> 01:54:01,542
At 4:00, an armed employee
at Ventana took control.

972
01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:06,964
We began an interview,
but lost the signal.

973
01:54:07,132 --> 01:54:11,469
- We do have a second camera.
- We have picture.

974
01:54:11,637 --> 01:54:15,848
I'm told we can switch
back to our second unit.

975
01:54:16,016 --> 01:54:20,770
There, you see it.
A big crowd outside the plant.

976
01:54:20,979 --> 01:54:24,440
This is what's going on.

977
01:54:35,285 --> 01:54:38,955
Don't deviate.
Stick to the prepared text.

978
01:54:39,122 --> 01:54:43,543
- Mr. Gibson, what's happening?
- Gather around, please.

979
01:54:43,710 --> 01:54:45,711
I have an announcement.

980
01:54:47,047 --> 01:54:51,717
A few minutes ago,
the situation was resolved.

981
01:54:51,885 --> 01:54:55,429
The Ventana nuclear plant is secure.

982
01:54:55,597 --> 01:55:01,769
- Did you get any of it?
- He looked like a lunatic.

983
01:55:05,065 --> 01:55:09,443
I stress that the public
was never in any danger.

984
01:55:09,611 --> 01:55:16,325
- Was there any damage?
- Yes, but it was totally contained.

985
01:55:16,493 --> 01:55:22,957
A disturbed employee was humored,
so that we could regain control.

986
01:55:23,125 --> 01:55:26,752
- Had he been drinking?
- Yes, we think so.

987
01:55:33,510 --> 01:55:39,932
Mr. De Young is superintendent,
and Mr. Spindler ran the operation.

988
01:55:41,727 --> 01:55:45,062
Get your picture back.
There's Kimberly.

989
01:55:45,230 --> 01:55:50,693
Mr. De Young, a few minutes ago...
Please let me ask a question.

990
01:55:50,861 --> 01:55:55,323
- Losing picture.
- Let me ask a question!

991
01:55:55,490 --> 01:56:00,620
A few minutes ago, Jack Godell
was shot dead. Why was he killed?

992
01:56:00,787 --> 01:56:05,791
Just a minute, Miss Wells.
He was emotionally disturbed.

993
01:56:05,959 --> 01:56:12,423
- Who ordered the SWAT team in?
- He was out of control, dangerous.

994
01:56:12,591 --> 01:56:16,927
Mr. Spindler, do you agree?
Was he disturbed?

995
01:56:17,095 --> 01:56:21,098
- Had he reason to be disturbed?
- I don't know.

996
01:56:21,266 --> 01:56:26,187
- Had he been drinking?
- I don't know.

997
01:56:26,355 --> 01:56:29,649
Why did he do it?
What did he say to you?

998
01:56:29,816 --> 01:56:35,863
- What did he say to you?
- That the plant should be closed.

999
01:56:36,031 --> 01:56:38,032
Do you agree with that?

1000
01:56:40,202 --> 01:56:44,372
- It's not my place to say.
- Then whose is it?

1001
01:56:44,539 --> 01:56:48,626
- Ted, we have to go...
- Mr. Gibson, let him speak!

1002
01:56:48,794 --> 01:56:50,086
Whose place is it?

1003
01:56:52,047 --> 01:56:54,173
Wait a minute!

1004
01:56:55,884 --> 01:57:02,765
Jack Godell was my best friend.
These guys say he was a loony.

1005
01:57:02,974 --> 01:57:08,938
He wasn't a loony.
He was the sanest man I ever knew.

1006
01:57:09,106 --> 01:57:13,275
- He believed the plant was unsafe?
- Yeah.

1007
01:57:13,443 --> 01:57:20,241
Otherwise he wouldn't have done it.
He wasn't like that.

1008
01:57:20,409 --> 01:57:25,287
I didn't know all the details.
He told me a few things.

1009
01:57:25,497 --> 01:57:28,958
There will be an investigation
this time.

1010
01:57:29,167 --> 01:57:33,462
Then people will know
Godell was a hero.

1011
01:57:34,548 --> 01:57:36,716
Jack Godell was a hero.

1012
01:57:38,885 --> 01:57:40,594
I have to go.

1013
01:57:44,433 --> 01:57:49,562
- Those were personal comments.
- Come on, we're live.

1014
01:57:49,730 --> 01:57:53,983
Godell was his friend,
and obviously he's distraught.

1015
01:57:54,151 --> 01:57:57,528
Come on. Hold on.

1016
01:58:01,616 --> 01:58:05,327
Remind Kimberly we're still live.

1017
01:58:05,495 --> 01:58:11,333
- Spindler is only an employee...
- Come on, we're on the air.

1018
01:58:11,543 --> 01:58:14,503
Pete, I met Jack...

1019
01:58:14,671 --> 01:58:17,757
I met Jack Godell two days ago.

1020
01:58:17,924 --> 01:58:23,345
He wasn't a drunk or a crazy man.

1021
01:58:24,473 --> 01:58:31,312
He was about to present evidence
to show this plant should be shut down.

1022
01:58:33,899 --> 01:58:38,235
I'm sorry, I'm not very objective.
I hope it doesn't end here.

1023
01:58:38,403 --> 01:58:42,114
This is Kimberly Wells,
live at Channel 3.

1024
01:58:47,245 --> 01:58:49,747
Go right to commercial.

1025
01:58:49,915 --> 01:58:55,920
We'll be back with more about the
Ventana nuclear plant take-over...

1026
01:58:56,087 --> 01:58:58,506
right after this.

1027
01:59:01,551 --> 01:59:05,221
- Incredible.
- She did a hell of a good job.

1028
01:59:05,430 --> 01:59:08,808
I must say, I'm not surprised.

1029
01:59:12,187 --> 01:59:15,815
The SWAT team appeared on the scene,
went into the control room...

1030
01:59:15,982 --> 01:59:19,235
and something took place there
to trigger the accident.

1031
01:59:19,402 --> 01:59:24,240
Mr. Godell died at the controls
of this atomic plant.

1032
01:59:24,407 --> 01:59:27,701
