00:04:12,703 --> 00:04:15,206


2
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:44,694
- Good night, Pat.
- Good night.

3
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,326
- What happened? Old bank was beautiful.
- People kept robbing it.

4
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,912
It's a small price to pay for beauty.

5
00:05:01,002 --> 00:05:03,129
Hit me.

6
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,426
Again.

7
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:12,430
Bust!

8
00:05:14,807 --> 00:05:16,809
Give me credit, Mr Macon?

9
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:18,936
You know my rules, Tom.

10
00:05:20,604 --> 00:05:23,941
Well, looks like you just about
cleaned everybody out, fella.

11
00:05:23,983 --> 00:05:26,902
You haven't lost a hand
since you got the deal.

12
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:30,114
What's the secret of your success?

13
00:05:33,242 --> 00:05:35,286
Prayer.

14
00:05:35,786 --> 00:05:37,872
Let's just you and me play.

15
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,974
Hit it.

16
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:02,855
Bust!

17
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:08,069
Yeah. You're a hell of a card player, fella.

18
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:11,530
I know, cos I'm a hell of a card player.

19
00:06:13,032 --> 00:06:15,993
And I can't even spot how you're cheatin'.

20
00:06:29,507 --> 00:06:31,759
The money stays and you go.

21
00:06:35,387 --> 00:06:39,558
Well, we seem to be a little short
on brotherly love around here.

22
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:42,228
If you're with him,
you better get out of here.

23
00:06:42,254 --> 00:06:43,520
We're on our way.

24
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:45,564
- Come on.
- I wasn't cheating.

25
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:46,982
- Come on!
- I wasn't!

26
00:06:47,024 --> 00:06:51,153
You can die.
For that matter, you can both die.

27
00:06:51,195 --> 00:06:53,697
- Hear that?
- If he invites us to stay, we'll go.

28
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:58,035
- We were gonna leave anyway.
- He's gotta invite us to stick around.

29
00:06:59,203 --> 00:07:03,040
He'll draw on you. He's ready.
You don't know how fast he is.

30
00:07:11,257 --> 00:07:13,697
I'm over the hill,
but it can happen to you.

31
00:07:13,723 --> 00:07:15,619
That's just what
I wanna hear.

32
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:18,222
Every day you get older.
Now, that's a law.

33
00:07:18,264 --> 00:07:20,391
<i></i>

34
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:32,736
What would you think about
maybe asking us to stick around?

35
00:07:32,862 --> 00:07:35,197
- What?
- You don't have to mean it.

36
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:38,117
Just ask us to stick around. I promise you...

37
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,252
I can't help you, Sundance.

38
00:07:58,888 --> 00:08:03,475
I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid
when I said you were cheatin'.

39
00:08:06,437 --> 00:08:09,607
If I draw on you, you'll kill me.

40
00:08:09,648 --> 00:08:12,276
There's that possibility.

41
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:17,031
No. You'd be killin' yourself. So why
don't you just invite us to stick around?

42
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,493
Now, you can do it.

43
00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:23,871
And easy. Come on.

44
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,375
Come on.

45
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:32,880
Why don't you stick around?

46
00:08:32,963 --> 00:08:35,674
Thanks, but we gotta get goin'.

47
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:43,974
Hey, Kid.

48
00:08:44,016 --> 00:08:46,310
Hey, Kid! How good are ya?

49
00:08:57,696 --> 00:09:00,449
Like I been tellin' you, over the hill.

50
00:09:57,881 --> 00:10:03,387
Boy, every time I see Hole in the Wall again,
it's like seein' it fresh for the first time.

51
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,433
And every time that happens
I keep askin' myself the same question.

52
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:11,061
How can I be so damn stupid
as to keep comin' back here?

53
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,361
- What's your idea this time?
- Bolivia.

54
00:10:21,864 --> 00:10:25,909
- What's Bolivia?
- Bolivia. That's a country, stupid.

55
00:10:26,035 --> 00:10:27,863
In Central or South America.

56
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:29,063
One or the other.

57
00:10:30,122 --> 00:10:32,374
Why don't we just go to Mexico instead?

58
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:36,086
Cos all they got in Mexico is sweat.
There's too much of that here.

59
00:10:36,211 --> 00:10:39,882
If we'd been in business in the California
gold rush, where'd we have gone?

60
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:41,592
- California, right?
- Right.

61
00:10:41,717 --> 00:10:44,762
So when I say Bolivia,
you just think California.

62
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:51,894
You wouldn't believe what they're
findin' in the ground down there.

63
00:10:51,977 --> 00:10:54,563
Silver mines, gold mines, tin mines.

64
00:10:54,646 --> 00:10:57,858
Payrolls so heavy
we'd strain ourselves stealin' 'em.

65
00:10:57,941 --> 00:11:00,444
<i></i>

66
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:04,323
You just keep thinkin', Butch.
That's what you're good at!

67
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:08,327
Boy, I got vision and
the rest of the world wears bifocals.

68
00:11:30,474 --> 00:11:32,643
Hi, News. Whatcha doin'?

69
00:11:32,768 --> 00:11:35,979
Oh, howdy, Butch. Uh, nothin'.

70
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,773
Nothin'.

71
00:11:37,815 --> 00:11:39,316
Howdy, Sundance.

72
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:42,820
Well, you sure are.
You're doin' somethin'. What?

73
00:11:46,281 --> 00:11:50,494
Just fixin' to rob the Union Pacific Flyer,
Butch. That's all we had in mind.

74
00:11:51,995 --> 00:11:54,998
You fellas got everything
I told you all wrong.

75
00:11:55,165 --> 00:11:57,751
True, we might hit the Flyer,

76
00:11:57,835 --> 00:12:01,797
but even if we do, it won't be this run.
It'll be the next one - the return.

77
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,676
- Sundance and me been checking the banks.
- No banks.

78
00:12:05,717 --> 00:12:07,636
What?

79
00:12:08,387 --> 00:12:10,889
The Flyer, Butch.

80
00:12:12,141 --> 00:12:15,310
Fellas, bad as they are,
banks are better than trains.

81
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:19,189
They don't move. They stay put.
You know the money's in there.

82
00:12:19,231 --> 00:12:22,609
- When I left I gave orders.
- New orders been given.

83
00:12:22,693 --> 00:12:24,820
Well, I run things here, Harvey.

84
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:27,531
Used to you did.

85
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:29,658
Me now.

86
00:12:30,742 --> 00:12:32,870
This don't concern you!

87
00:12:35,164 --> 00:12:39,042
- You tell him to stay out.
- Well, he goes his own way like always.

88
00:12:40,502 --> 00:12:43,172
What's the matter with you guys?

89
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:45,883
When I came here, you weren't even a gang.
I formed ya!

90
00:12:46,008 --> 00:12:48,510
- Who says?
- Well, read 'em a clippin', News.

91
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:50,888
- Which one?
- Any of 'em!

92
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,896
Uh, this one here's from
the Salt Lake Herald.

93
00:12:58,937 --> 00:13:04,776
- "Butch Cassidy's Hole in the Wall Gang..."
- Butch Cassidy's gang - that's me!

94
00:13:04,902 --> 00:13:08,947
You want Harvey to do your plannin'?
To do your thinkin'? To run things?

95
00:13:09,072 --> 00:13:11,783
- "...outlaws with them on..."
- Shut up now, News!

96
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:13,994
Not till I get to the good part, Butch.

97
00:13:14,077 --> 00:13:19,458
"Known to have participated in the hold-up
are Flat Nose Curry and News Carver."

98
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:23,170
I just love to read my name
in the paper, Butch.

99
00:13:23,253 --> 00:13:26,340
OK, so we forget about
Logan takin' over. OK, Flat Nose?

100
00:13:26,423 --> 00:13:29,051
You always said any one of us
could challenge you.

101
00:13:29,092 --> 00:13:33,889
- It's cos I figured no one would do it.
- Figured wrong, Butch.

102
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:36,975
You guys can't want Logan!

103
00:13:37,893 --> 00:13:42,105
At least he's with us, Butch.
You've been spendin' a lot of time gone.

104
00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:44,608
- Cos everything's different.
- Guns or knives?

105
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:49,613
- It's harder now. You gotta plan more.
- Guns or knives?!

106
00:13:50,614 --> 00:13:52,324
- Neither.
- Pick!

107
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:54,952
I don't wanna shoot with you, Harvey.

108
00:13:55,994 --> 00:13:58,288
Anything you say, Butch.

109
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:17,266
Maybe there's a way to make a profit in this.

110
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,811
Bet on Logan.

111
00:14:20,852 --> 00:14:24,022
- I would, but who'd bet on you?
- Sundance,

112
00:14:25,482 --> 00:14:30,279
when we're done,
if he's dead, you're welcome to stay.

113
00:14:31,321 --> 00:14:36,493
Listen, I don't mean to be a sore loser,
but when it's done, if I'm dead, kill him.

114
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:38,662
Love to.

115
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:52,175
No, no, not yet. Not until me and Harvey
get the rules straightened out.

116
00:14:52,301 --> 00:14:55,178
Rules? In a knife fight? No rules!

117
00:14:55,304 --> 00:14:56,847
Agh!

118
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,309
If there ain't no rules, let's start.
Someone count 1, 2, 3, go.

119
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,519
1, 2, 3, go!

120
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:08,191
I was really rootin' for you, Butch.

121
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:10,193
Well, thank you, Flat Nose.

122
00:15:11,028 --> 00:15:14,156
That's what sustained me
in my time of trouble.

123
00:15:15,824 --> 00:15:18,368
Hey, what's this about the Flyer?

124
00:15:18,493 --> 00:15:21,204
Harvey said we'd hit it
both this run and the return.

125
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:25,500
Nobody's done that to the Flyer before.
No matter how much we got the first time,

126
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:29,713
they'd figure the return was safe
and load it up with money.

127
00:15:29,755 --> 00:15:32,716
- Harvey thought of that?!
- Yes, sir. He did.

128
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:36,720
I'll tell you somethin'.
That's what we're gonna do.

129
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:17,427
- Stop it!
- Where?

130
00:16:17,928 --> 00:16:19,930
Up ahead there.

131
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:23,100
Bet that's old Butch himself!

132
00:16:29,898 --> 00:16:31,942
Hold it there.

133
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:36,613
- I just thought I'd watch.
- Bring the kids, why don't you?

134
00:16:36,655 --> 00:16:38,782
Stick your heads in.

135
00:16:39,324 --> 00:16:42,327
You'll get yourself blown up,
you don't open that door.

136
00:16:42,452 --> 00:16:44,257
<i></i> I can't do that on account of

137
00:16:44,283 --> 00:16:47,190
I work for E.H. Harriman
of the Union Pacific Railroad...

138
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,252
Shut up about that E.H. Harriman stuff
and open the door!

139
00:16:50,293 --> 00:16:52,921
- What's goin' on?
- We got a patriot in there.

140
00:16:52,963 --> 00:16:56,967
- OK, go ahead, News.
- That's Woodcock. He's awful dedicated.

141
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,136
- Woodcock!
- Yes, sir.

142
00:17:00,178 --> 00:17:01,847
You know who we are?

143
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,308
You're the Hole in the Wall Gang,
Mr Cassidy. I understand.

144
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,904
But you gotta understand Mr E.H.
Harriman himself

145
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,921
of the Union Pacific give me this job.

146
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,985
- I've gotta do my best, don't you see?
- That don't include gettin' yourself killed!

147
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:18,405
- Dynamite's ready.
- Mr E.H. Harriman had the confidence...

148
00:17:18,488 --> 00:17:24,244
Open the door or that's it! Do you think E.H.
Harriman would get himself killed for you?

149
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:25,954
Woodcock?

150
00:17:26,037 --> 00:17:31,334
I work for Mr E.H. Harriman of the Union
Pacific Railroad, and he entrusted me...

151
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:50,520
Hey, Woodcock.
Hey, Woodcock, you all right?

152
00:17:50,562 --> 00:17:52,355
Hey.

153
00:17:52,481 --> 00:17:54,357
Hm...

154
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:57,694
Oh.

155
00:17:58,737 --> 00:18:01,865
Whatever Harriman's payin'
you ain't enough.

156
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:13,710
There ain't what I'd call
a fortune in there, Butch.

157
00:18:13,794 --> 00:18:17,339
Well, just so we come out ahead.
That's the main thing.

158
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:23,762
The Hole in the Wall Gang, I guess you
heard, robbed the Flyer outside our town,

159
00:18:23,845 --> 00:18:28,809
so that makes it our responsibility
to get out there and get after them.

160
00:18:28,892 --> 00:18:31,895
Now, you're gonna have
to bring your own horses.

161
00:18:31,937 --> 00:18:34,731
How many of you can bring your own guns?

162
00:18:38,109 --> 00:18:42,906
Yeah, well, how many of you are going
to want me to supply you with guns?

163
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:51,248
Well... Come on, now. I think it's
up to us to do something, don't you?

164
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:54,584
Why? They're probably halfway
to Hole in the Wall already.

165
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:57,754

00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:02,048
At least that'd be a change.
They don't even break formation.

499
00:54:02,106 --> 00:54:04,192
Do something!

500
00:54:38,893 --> 00:54:41,396
- Kid?
- What?

501
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,732
Who's the best lawman?

502
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:49,988
Best? How? You mean toughest,
or easiest to bribe?

503
00:54:50,571 --> 00:54:52,281
Toughest.

504
00:54:53,658 --> 00:54:55,284
Joe Lefors.

505
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,246
Gotta be.

506
00:55:01,749 --> 00:55:04,193
Lefors never leaves Wyoming. Never.

507
00:55:04,219 --> 00:55:05,436
You know that.

508
00:55:06,295 --> 00:55:08,589
He always wears a white skimmer.

509
00:55:08,631 --> 00:55:12,802
That's how you tell it's Joe Lefors
cos he wears a white straw hat.

510
00:55:14,637 --> 00:55:16,764
Look at that guy out front.

511
00:55:36,492 --> 00:55:38,661
Jeez, who are those guys?

512
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:45,626
Yah! Come on!

513
00:55:46,294 --> 00:55:48,337
On your feet, you dumbhead.

514
00:56:32,173 --> 00:56:34,675
Go on! Get outta here! Go on!

515
00:56:36,177 --> 00:56:38,179
What if they don't follow the horse?

516
00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:42,475
You're the brains, Butch.
You'll think of somethin'.

517
00:56:42,517 --> 00:56:45,019
That's a load off my mind.

518
00:58:04,891 --> 00:58:06,976

519
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:11,355
Dammit!

520
00:58:24,827 --> 00:58:27,663
The way I figure it,
we can either fight or give.

521
00:58:27,788 --> 00:58:31,083
- If we give, we go to jail.
- I've been there already.

522
00:58:31,959 --> 00:58:35,963
But if we fight, they can stay
right where they are and starve us out.

523
00:58:36,005 --> 00:58:40,468
Or go for position, shoot us. Might even
get a rock slide started and get us that way.

524
00:58:40,593 --> 00:58:42,595
What else can they do?

525
00:58:42,637 --> 00:58:45,473
They could surrender,
but I wouldn't count on that.

526
00:58:46,641 --> 00:58:49,352
They're goin' for position all right.

527
00:58:50,311 --> 00:58:52,647
Better get ready.

528
00:58:54,982 --> 00:58:58,072
Kid, the next time I say
let's go someplace like Bolivia,

529
00:58:58,098 --> 00:58:59,987
let's go someplace like Bolivia.

530
00:59:00,029 --> 00:59:01,572
Next time...

531
00:59:03,574 --> 00:59:05,409
Ready?

532
00:59:06,827 --> 00:59:08,871
No, we'll jump.

533
00:59:13,209 --> 00:59:16,504
- Like hell we will.
- No, it'll be OK,

534
00:59:16,545 --> 00:59:19,674
if we're not squished to death.
They'll never follow us.

535
00:59:19,715 --> 00:59:23,261
- How do you know?
- Would you jump if you didn't have to?

536
00:59:23,344 --> 00:59:27,223
- I have to and I'm not gonna.
- Well, we got to, otherwise we're dead.

537
00:59:27,348 --> 00:59:30,017
They'll just have to go back
the same way they come.

538
00:59:30,059 --> 00:59:32,478
- Just one clear shot.
- Come on.

539
00:59:32,561 --> 00:59:34,230
- We got to!
- Get away from me.

540
00:59:34,313 --> 00:59:36,107
- Why?
- I wanna fight 'em!

541
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:37,692
- They'll kill us!
- Maybe.

542
00:59:37,733 --> 00:59:40,194
- You wanna die?
- Do you?

543
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:43,823
All right. I'll jump first.

544
00:59:43,864 --> 00:59:45,741
- No.
- Then you jump first.

545
00:59:45,866 --> 00:59:47,743
- No, I said.
- What's the matter?

546
00:59:47,827 --> 00:59:49,870
I can't swim!

547
00:59:59,547 --> 01:00:03,092
Why, are you crazy?
The fall will probably kill ya!

548
01:00:12,727 --> 01:00:15,271
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

549
01:00:15,396 --> 01:00:18,899
Oh, shi...

550
01:00:26,407 --> 01:00:29,744
- You're drownin' me!
- I can't help it! I can't swim!

551
01:00:29,869 --> 01:00:33,748
- Kid, I'll kill ya! You're choking me!
- I can't swim!

Kid, let go of my throat!

557
01:01:22,963 --> 01:01:25,633
The papers said they had you.

558
01:01:25,674 --> 01:01:31,138
- Was it Lefors? Did they say?
- Joe Lefors? I think so.

559
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:33,849
- And their tracker?
- Tracker?

560
01:01:33,974 --> 01:01:37,812
- Was it Lord Baltimore?
- I think so. The paper's inside.

561
01:01:45,111 --> 01:01:47,405
You got enough to feed us?

562
01:01:47,488 --> 01:01:49,532
Don't you know I do?

563
01:01:50,491 --> 01:01:54,161
- They said you were dead.
- Don't make a big thing out of it.

564
01:01:57,498 --> 01:01:59,792
No, make a big thing out of it.

565
01:02:05,089 --> 01:02:07,007
Hey!

566
01:02:07,758 --> 01:02:10,261
It was Baltimore and Lefors.

567
01:02:16,016 --> 01:02:17,893
What?

568
01:02:19,186 --> 01:02:20,855
- You know who else?
- Who?

569
01:02:20,938 --> 01:02:23,232
- Jeff Car, George Hiatt...
- Hiatt?

570
01:02:23,357 --> 01:02:25,359
...T.T. Kelliher.

571
01:02:28,946 --> 01:02:32,533
Jeez, we lucked out getting away.
You know that?

572
01:02:34,869 --> 01:02:38,372
But why would these guys join up
and take after us, though?

573
01:02:38,497 --> 01:02:41,375
Forget it. A bunch like that
won't stay together long.

574
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:45,212
- They will, if Mr Harriman has his way.
- Who?

575
01:02:45,254 --> 01:02:50,593
E.H. Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad.
He resents the way you've picked on him,

576
01:02:50,676 --> 01:02:54,221
so he's outfitted a special train
and hired special employees.

577
01:02:54,889 --> 01:02:57,391
You've spent the last two days
avoiding them.

578
01:02:57,516 --> 01:03:01,604
It's really sort of flattering,
if you wanna think about it that way.

579
01:03:01,729 --> 01:03:06,567
- A setup like that costs more than we took.
- Apparently he can afford it.

580
01:03:09,111 --> 01:03:11,238
That crazy Harriman.

581
01:03:13,282 --> 01:03:15,201
That's bad business!

582
01:03:15,242 --> 01:03:17,713
How long d'you think I'd stay in operation

583
01:03:17,739 --> 01:03:20,439
if every time I pulled a job
it cost me money?

584
01:03:20,498 --> 01:03:25,794
If he'd pay me what he's spendin' to make me
stop robbin' him, I'd stop robbin' him!

585
01:03:28,297 --> 01:03:31,217
You probably inherited every penny you got!

586
01:03:31,884 --> 01:03:36,055
- Inherited guys. What the hell do they know?
- You say they're hired permanent?

587
01:03:36,889 --> 01:03:39,141
No. Just till they kill you.

588
01:03:48,901 --> 01:03:52,071
That means they're still after us, Butch.

589
01:03:52,112 --> 01:03:55,366
And it's gonna be
the same thing all over again.

590
01:03:59,995 --> 01:04:02,248

596
01:04:31,652 --> 01:04:36,657
Yeah, we'll go down there and play it safe.
Maybe keep our hand in a little bit.

597
01:04:37,658 --> 01:04:39,702
Uh, Butch speaks some Spanish.

598
01:04:39,827 --> 01:04:43,330
- I can wrestle with a menu OK.
- And you speak it good.

599
01:04:44,832 --> 01:04:47,334
It'd be good cover goin' with a woman.

600
01:04:48,335 --> 01:04:50,462
No one expects it.

601
01:04:51,672 --> 01:04:53,799
We could travel safer.

602
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:59,972
What I'm sayin' is
if you wanna go, I won't stop you.

603

But the minute you start
to whine or make a nuisance,

604
01:05:03,392 --> 01:05:07,187
I don't care where we are,
I'm dumpin' you flat.

Tell her straight.

is here with me now.

I'll sew your socks and stitch your wounds,

the garden spot of the whole country.

to get to this spot where we're standing now.

New Jersey of all Bolivia.

You do, huh?

625
01:12:07,607 --> 01:12:09,443

- Brought up there. So...
- You're from the East. I didn't know.

- I'm not sure we're accomplishing anything.
- Listen!

630
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:27,294
Your job is to back me up,

This is not going to work and we'll be up
all night until you get this.

665
01:15:19,466 --> 01:15:21,509
Now, give me the money.

666
01:15:26,139 --> 01:15:28,229
It's on the tip of my tongue, Etta.

667
01:15:28,255 --> 01:15:29,284
I swear it.

668
01:15:31,728 --> 01:15:34,731
Butch, are you still thinking in there?

669
01:15:34,814 --> 01:15:36,816
What the hell else is there to do?

670
01:15:37,484 --> 01:15:39,486
Try this one.

671
01:15:39,527 --> 01:15:41,863
Where is the safe? Open it.

672
01:15:42,530 --> 01:15:44,616
<i>¿Dónde es...?</i>

673
01:15:47,786 --> 01:15:50,038
Mm. Uh, that's a hard one.

674
01:15:52,999 --> 01:15:55,377
<i>¿Dónde está la caja? ¡Ábrala!</i>

675
01:15:56,336 --> 01:15:57,712
That's very good, Butch.

676
01:15:59,214 --> 01:16:01,383
You're a good teacher, Etta.

677
01:16:02,384 --> 01:16:04,761

<i>Comandante,
dos hombres acaban de asaltar el banco.</i>

<i>¡Vamonos! Vengan ustedes, ¡a los caballos!</i>

696

Isn't that a pretty sight?

697
01:18:28,655 --> 01:18:32,200
We're back in business,
boys and girls, just like the old days.

698
01:22:59,425 --> 01:23:01,302
- Jose!
- Si, señor.

699
01:23:01,427 --> 01:23:03,596
We should stay, get him and be done with it.

700
01:23:03,721 --> 01:23:07,767
Yeah, but what if we lose? We saw him
with two guys, but what if he's got 20?

701
01:23:07,809 --> 01:23:11,479
- You don't know for sure it's Lefors.
- I'm a hell of a guesser.

702
01:23:11,604 --> 01:23:15,024
He can't arrest you here.
It's a foreign country. Or take you back.

703
01:23:15,108 --> 01:23:18,319
He's not gonna take anybody back.
He wants to finish us here.

704
01:23:18,444 --> 01:23:21,447
He'll wait for us to pull a job,
then hunt us like before.

705
01:23:21,489 --> 01:23:24,538
And if he misses us,
he'll wait for the next job.

706
01:23:24,564 --> 01:23:27,186
Let's finish it now,
one way or the other.

707
01:23:28,162 --> 01:23:31,624
He's gotta wait for us, right?
To pull another job?

708
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:35,086
Well, what if there isn't another job?

709
01:23:35,128 --> 01:23:38,798
I mean, he can't arrest us
and he can't take us outta here.

710
01:23:38,923 --> 01:23:43,302
We'll drive him crazy.
We'll outlast the bastard. We'll go straight!

711
01:23:43,386 --> 01:23:45,471
So you want jobs?

712
01:23:46,389 --> 01:23:51,769
You're from the US of A
and you are seeking after employment.

713
01:23:51,811 --> 01:23:56,284
Well, you couldn't have picked a more
out of the way place in all Bolivia,

714
01:23:56,310 --> 01:23:57,800
I'll tell you that.

715
01:23:58,818 --> 01:24:00,903
<i>Gracias, Jesús.</i>

716
01:24:00,987 --> 01:24:07,368
Ordinarily, you've got to wait to work
for Percy Garris, but this ain't ordinarily.

717
01:24:07,493 --> 01:24:08,828
Bingo.

718
01:24:08,953 --> 01:24:10,400
You mean there are jobs?

719
01:24:10,426 --> 01:24:13,441
Yes, there are jobs.
There are lots of jobs.

720
01:24:13,499 --> 01:24:15,710
Don't you wanna know why?

721
01:24:15,835 --> 01:24:17,879
Yeah. Why?

722
01:24:18,004 --> 01:24:19,589
Dammy.

723
01:24:19,672 --> 01:24:22,842
Because I cannot promise to pay you.

724
01:24:23,551 --> 01:24:26,053
Don't you wanna know why?

725
01:24:26,179 --> 01:24:28,222
OK. Why?

726
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:34,061
On account of the payroll thieves,
fellow citizens.

727
01:24:34,187 --> 01:24:39,150
You see, every mine around
gets its payroll from La Paz.

728
01:24:39,817 --> 01:24:43,362
And every mine around
gets its payroll held up.

729
01:24:44,363 --> 01:24:47,950
Some say it's the Bolivian bandits and...

730
01:24:48,868 --> 01:24:53,372
some say that it's the "Bandidos Yanquis".

731
01:24:53,873 --> 01:24:55,958
Could I see that?

732
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:00,838
Uh-huh.

733
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:04,717
Fairly nice-looking piece.
Can you hit anything?

734
01:25:05,551 --> 01:25:07,637
- Sometimes.
- Hm.

735
01:25:16,229 --> 01:25:18,272
Hit that.

736
01:25:23,903 --> 01:25:28,241
No, no, son. No, son.
I just wanna know, uh, can you shoot.

737
01:25:28,324 --> 01:25:30,409
Put your piece in your hand

738
01:25:31,619 --> 01:25:33,746
and shoot.

739
01:25:44,882 --> 01:25:46,759
Dammy.

740
01:25:46,884 --> 01:25:48,845
Can I move?

741
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:51,764
Move? What the hell you mean move?

742
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:59,772
- I'm better when I move.
- Yeah.

743
01:26:01,107 --> 01:26:06,946
Well, uh, considering that I'm desperate
and you are just what I'm looking for,

744
01:26:07,029 --> 01:26:11,617
on top of which you stem from the US of A,
we start tomorrow morning.

745
01:26:11,701 --> 01:26:14,203
- You mean we got jobs?
- Payroll guard.

746
01:26:14,829 --> 01:26:16,289
Dammy.

The last time we tried a ranch
was during our rustlin' days.

823
01:34:57,601 --> 01:35:02,314

It's hard. Hours are brutal.

01:36:08,213 --> 01:36:11,467
Etta's thinking of maybe
goin' home ahead of us.

834
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:17,264
Whatever she wants.

835
01:36:19,558 --> 01:36:21,643
I'll go, then.

836
01:36:59,056 --> 01:37:01,099
<i>¡Manos arriba!</i>

837
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:06,563
- <i></i> How much you got?
- Ah, it's hardly worth it. Alpoca Mine.

838
01:37:06,647 --> 01:37:10,567
- I tell you, no more jungle work for me.
- You're gettin' to be an old maid.

839
01:37:10,651 --> 01:37:13,987
Keep your old-maid remarks
to yourself, if you don't mind.

840
01:37:14,071 --> 01:37:17,866
I'll work in the city and mountains,
but from now on jungle work is out!

841
01:37:18,784 --> 01:37:21,411
<i>- ¿Bandidos Yanquis?
- Mm-hm.</i>

842
01:37:21,453 --> 01:37:23,622
Tell 'em to be quiet.

843
01:37:23,747 --> 01:37:26,124
- What's the word?
<i>- Quietos.</i>

844
01:37:26,208 --> 01:37:28,293
<i>¡Quietos!</i>

845
01:37:37,803 --> 01:37:40,722
I tell you, the jungle's
a better cover for payrolls.

846
01:37:40,806 --> 01:37:45,519
Kid, I got a right to my opinion, and
in my opinion there are snakes in the jungle.

847
01:37:45,644 --> 01:37:48,313
I don't work around snakes.

848
01:37:48,438 --> 01:37:50,691
What is this place?

849
01:37:50,816 --> 01:37:53,318
I don't know. San Vicente, I think.

850
01:37:53,652 --> 01:37:56,154
<i>- ¿Comer?
- Sí, señor. Pasen.</i>

851
01:37:56,196 --> 01:37:58,740
<i>¡Juan! Ven. Llévate los caballos.</i>

852
01:38:24,891 --> 01:38:29,688
I don't enjoy jungles or swamps. I don't like
snakes. I don't much care for night work.

853
01:38:29,771 --> 01:38:32,024
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

854
01:38:33,525 --> 01:38:36,069
<i>¡Capitán! Capitán!</i>

855
01:38:36,194 --> 01:38:38,905
<i>Capitán, allí en la plaza
hay una mula de las minas de Alpoca.</i>

856
01:38:38,989 --> 01:38:40,032
<i>De las minas de Alpoca?</i>

857
01:38:40,365 --> 01:38:43,294
<i>Si. Allí está,
dos hombres la acaban de traer,</i>

858
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:45,937
<i>están comiendo en el
restorán de mi papá.</i>

859
01:38:46,204 --> 01:38:50,375
<i>El guisado está delicioso.
Para chuparse los dedos.</i>

860
01:38:51,376 --> 01:38:54,921
<i>Es la especialidad de la casa.</i>

861
01:38:55,047 --> 01:39:00,052
<i>Se quieren más no tengan pena y díganmelo.
Yo estoy aquí para servirles.</i>

862
01:39:00,177 --> 01:39:04,139
<i>Agradezco la visita
de tan distinguidos caballeros.</i>

863
01:39:04,222 --> 01:39:06,558
<i>Muchas gracias. Para servirles.</i>

864
01:39:06,725 --> 01:39:08,810
<i>- Muchas gracias.
- Sí.</i>

865
01:39:12,189 --> 01:39:15,400
The specialty of the house
and it's still movin'!

866
01:39:15,442 --> 01:39:17,319
<i></i>

867
01:39:23,742 --> 01:39:27,746
Well, that settles it.
This place gets no more of my business.

868
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:37,214
- Hey.
- What?

869
01:39:37,255 --> 01:39:39,424
What do you think?

870
01:39:39,549 --> 01:39:41,593
I bet it's just one guy.

871
01:39:49,559 --> 01:39:52,020
Don't you get sick of
being right all the time?

872
01:40:22,467 --> 01:40:24,511
Reloading.

873
01:40:27,222 --> 01:40:29,307
That's all I got.

874
01:40:33,562 --> 01:40:37,149
We're gonna run out unless
we can get to that mule and get some more.

875
01:40:41,528 --> 01:40:43,613
I'll go.

876
01:40:43,697 --> 01:40:46,825
This is no time for bravery. I'll let you.

877
01:40:48,577 --> 01:40:50,454
Loaded.

878
01:40:51,121 --> 01:40:53,206
<i></i>

879
01:40:57,335 --> 01:41:00,005
Hell! I'm the one that has to go.

880
01:41:02,007 --> 01:41:03,508
Why you?

881
01:41:03,592 --> 01:41:07,179
Cos I could never give you cover.
You can cover me.

882
01:41:10,348 --> 01:41:12,851
You can see I'm right, can't you?

883
01:41:19,024 --> 01:41:23,195
- You go.
- Yeah, why am I always so damned smart?

884
01:41:30,035 --> 01:41:32,162
Here. Gimme your gun.

885
01:41:39,294 --> 01:41:41,379
OK. Go!

886
01:41:58,063 --> 01:42:00,190
OK!

887
01:42:38,979 --> 01:42:40,939
Go!

888
01:43:40,332 --> 01:43:42,000
Agh!

889
01:44:25,043 --> 01:44:28,088
Is... is that what you call giving cover?

890
01:44:28,838 --> 01:44:31,091
Is that what you call running?

891
01:44:31,925 --> 01:44:34,636
If I... knew you were gonna stroll...

892
01:44:36,054 --> 01:44:39,557
You never could shoot,
not from the very beginning.

893
01:44:45,397 --> 01:44:47,482
And you are all mouth!

894
01:44:55,907 --> 01:44:57,951
<i>Jefe, ya Ilegó el ejército.</i>

895
01:45:09,421 --> 01:45:11,506
<i>¡Mi capitán!</i>

896
01:45:12,257 --> 01:45:14,509
<i>- ¿Dónde están?
- Allí en la plaza.</i>

897
01:45:14,592 --> 01:45:17,387
<i>- ¿Cuántos hombres son?
- Dos hombres.</i>

898
01:45:17,429 --> 01:45:18,763
<i>- ¿Dos?
- Mi capitán...</i>

899
01:45:18,805 --> 01:45:21,433
<i>- ¿Dos?
- Bandidos Yanquis.</i>

900
01:45:22,434 --> 01:45:25,145
<i>- Bandidos Yanquis, ¿eh?
- Sí, mi capitán.</i>

901
01:45:26,521 --> 01:45:30,316
<i>¡Sargento Rico! Desmonte a veinte hombres
y que vengan con el teniente.</i>

902
01:45:30,442 --> 01:45:34,112
<i>¡Sargento! Rodeen el zócalo,
y suban hacia la azotea y espérenme.</i>

903
01:45:34,154 --> 01:45:37,741
<i>¡Media vuelta en el lugar! Al frente!</i>

904
01:46:46,059 --> 01:46:49,521
- I got a great idea where we should go next.
- I don't wanna hear it.

905
01:46:49,646 --> 01:46:52,857
- You'll change your mind when I tell ya.
- Shut up!

906
01:46:52,899 --> 01:46:55,068
- OK, OK.
- Your great ideas got us here...

907
01:46:55,193 --> 01:46:58,029
- Forget it!
- I never wanna hear another of your ideas.

908
01:46:58,154 --> 01:47:00,198
- All right.
- OK.

909
01:47:10,083 --> 01:47:12,210
Australia.

910
01:47:14,504 --> 01:47:18,550
I figured, secretly
you wanted to know, so I told you.

911
01:47:18,633 --> 01:47:20,718
Australia.

912
01:47:21,553 --> 01:47:23,139
That's your great idea?

913
01:47:23,165 --> 01:47:26,749
Oh, boy, it's the latest in...
in a long line.

914
01:47:26,808 --> 01:47:29,769
- Australia's no better than here.
- That's all you know.

915
01:47:29,894 --> 01:47:33,106
- Name me one thing...
- They speak English in Australia!

916
01:47:33,231 --> 01:47:36,901
- They do?
- Yeah, smart guy. We wouldn't be foreigners.

917
01:47:40,071 --> 01:47:44,742
They got horses in Australia. Hell, they got
thousands of miles we could hide out in.

918
01:47:44,868 --> 01:47:47,287
Good climate, beaches.
You could learn to swim.

919
01:47:47,412 --> 01:47:50,290
No! Swimming isn't important.

920
01:47:52,750 --> 01:47:54,836
What about the banks?

921
01:47:55,587 --> 01:47:58,256
They're easy. Easy, ripe and luscious.

922
01:47:58,381 --> 01:48:00,425
<i></i>

923
01:48:03,011 --> 01:48:04,929
The banks or the women?

924
01:48:05,013 --> 01:48:07,765
Well, once you got one, you got the other!

925
01:48:11,644 --> 01:48:15,190
- It's a long way though.
- Ah! Everything's gotta be perfect with you!

926
01:48:15,273 --> 01:48:18,610
I just don't wanna get there
and find out it stinks, that's all.

927
01:48:18,651 --> 01:48:20,778
At least think about it.

928
01:48:22,780 --> 01:48:25,325
All right.

929
01:48:25,408 --> 01:48:27,452
I'll think about it.

930
01:48:31,664 --> 01:48:33,541
Hey.

931
01:48:34,626 --> 01:48:38,296
When we get outside,
when we get to the horses,

932
01:48:38,421 --> 01:48:40,465
just remember one thing.

933
01:48:44,552 --> 01:48:46,846
- Hey, wait a minute.
- What?

934
01:48:47,472 --> 01:48:50,141
You didn't see Lefors out there, did you?

935
01:48:50,225 --> 01:48:52,602
Lefors?

936
01:48:52,644 --> 01:48:54,812
No.

937
01:48:54,854 --> 01:48:56,814
Oh, good.

938
01:48:56,940 --> 01:49:00,026
For a moment there
I thought we were in trouble.

939
01:49:07,158 --> 01:49:10,036
<i> ¡Fuego!
</i>

940
01:49:10,161 --> 01:49:12,664
<i>¡Fuego!
</i>

941
01:49:14,207 --> 01:49:16,709
<i>¡Fuego!
</i>
