1
00:01:58,889 --> 00:02:06,523
Carobs. Carobs. I harvested them
and now you're eating them.

2
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:11,484
Feel the perfume! Three for
half a lira.

3
00:02:11,529 --> 00:02:13,804
- Give me for half a lira.
- And to me.

4
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:17,319
You either eat these,
or eat nothing.

5
00:02:17,369 --> 00:02:21,408
Come on, you can buy them without a
ration.

6
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:28,207
Carobs! Eat! We've gotten
worse than swines.

7
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:16,127
Let me breath! I need air!

8
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:20,128
Make way for the Holy Virgin!

9
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:26,358
Would you want to leave the Holy Virgin
under bombs, on her celebration day?

10
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:30,925
- Make way!
- There's no place!

11
00:03:31,809 --> 00:03:36,041
What have we done wrong to God?
Must he send all of them here?

12
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:41,721
Don Mario, I've counted it. With this one,
we've had 122 bombardments.

13
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:45,967
You're attracting them. If only they'd
fly throw their bombs on Rome.

14
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:49,206
No, not on Roma, my son's there.

15
00:03:49,249 --> 00:03:52,639
Better they bombard here.
No loss if we die.

16
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:58,161
You can't decide that. There can't be
any personal issues.

17
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:01,918
- Silence. - Listen to me.
Oh man, what's with this silence?

18
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:29,562
<i>In order to spare the nation
from further disasters...</i>

19
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:34,285
<i>...the Italian Government has asked
general Eisenhower, Commander in Chief</i>

20
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:37,844
<i>...of the allied Anglo-American
forces for a truce...</i>

21
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:43,122
The war is over!
The war is over!

22
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:53,641
The war is over!
No more war!

23
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:59,605
The war is over!
No more war!

24
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:05,880
No more hunger! It's over!
No more bombs!

25
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:09,399
- Can this be true?
- This is all crazy!

26
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:13,078
The Holy Virgin has spared us,
on her celebration day.

27
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:16,041
Nunziatina, we can get married now!

28
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:31,725
- Have you lost something? - Arturo,
you can get out, war is over!

29
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:35,768
Look where she had hidden her son!

30
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,966
Yes, I wouldn't give him to them
for this beautiful war!

31
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:42,968
Come at daddy.

32
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:47,480
Easy, handsome. Take him slowly
to light.

33
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:50,805
- Open your eyes slowly.
- Help him out.

34
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:53,158
Come out, my son.

35
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:59,239
My soul! My little one!
Mother's soul!

36
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:05,208
Now no one's going to take you away
from my arms.

37
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:08,202
"Chiattona", don't worry, I'll
even kiss you!

38
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:14,484
- Me?! But I'm old!
- Today I find you all beautiful!

39
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:19,802
I can shave at last!
I must get drunk!

40
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:23,159
Rejoice, soldiers,
we have lost the war!

41
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:35,684
Open up! Mail for the 3rd
anti-aircraft squad.

42
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:40,166
With all this you worry about the mail?
Take a hike!

43
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:46,477
Hey, you want it? I'll give it to you!

44
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,605
What are you doing?

45
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:57,480
I don't know! What do you intend doing?
Here's chaos!

46
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:01,408
- Capitain, what are we to do?
- I've got orders not
to give orders anymore!

47
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:05,362
- If no one gives orders...
- Don't bother me, take care of yourselves!

48
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:08,446
- War is over, isn't it?
- Yes. Only morons fought.

49
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,081
The king of morons tells you this!

50
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:17,444
- Thief! - I raised the chicken in the
barracks. - Then enjoy.

51
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:22,008
What noise (casino) you're making
at the brothel (casino)!

52
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:27,447
Women, today all for free!
You don't have to pay!

53
00:08:27,489 --> 00:08:32,119
Poor whores, always locked up!
Even they're taking a little fresh air.

54
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:37,243
- What beauty! - Raise the flag!
We haven't won the war!

55
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:41,407
- Even those that lost it, won the war!
- Even the whores!

56
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:50,806
What are you doing, beauty? You're sad?

57
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:55,959
- I'm happy.
- Why?

58
00:08:56,929 --> 00:09:02,367
- And what will you do now?
- Nothing, like before.

59
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:09,197
But still I'm happy, for all this
soldiers who can go home now.

60
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:14,198
Scram, stinking German!
Don't come here anymore!

61
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:17,082
Hitler kaput. War kaput. Hurray!

62
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:19,768
Fritz, go fritz yourself!

63
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:24,121
- Don't forget me!
- Careful, potato.

64
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:28,366
Hey, "your war,
my war, all finished"!

65
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:31,958
- Do you take me for your girl?
- Let's go!

66
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:36,207
- Where shall I take you?
- Home. All Germans go back in Germany.

67
00:09:36,249 --> 00:09:40,481
- In Germany by bike?!
- Yes! All's over! Peace!

68
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:46,525
Hurry up, take him away! Sooner they go,
better it is! Go!

69
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:53,680
<i>A lira haven't I got,
but love it is my lot!</i>

70
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:58,847
Let's go!

71
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:03,041
Hitler kaput. War kaput.
Happy?

72
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:06,923
Of course, my husband will be back!
He's a soldier too.

73
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:13,244
- All's over!
- Hurray!

74
00:10:48,969 --> 00:10:53,281
What are you doing?

75
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:37,603
Pitrella, let's go.

76
00:11:45,729 --> 00:11:47,720
Down.

77
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:11,762
What shall we do now?

78
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:17,088
Lieutenant, why are you looking at me?

79
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:29,568
Then, Lieutenant?
Pitrella doesn't say anything?

80
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:34,319
- There's nothing else to do.
- Come, let's throw everything, us also.

81
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:41,239
- Everyone returns home.
- Happy you, living in Naples!

82
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:46,806
- But will the Lieutenant let us?
- The officers are gentlemen!

83
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:55,085
<i>This sailor pays for the hostile acts
against the Germans.</i>

84
00:12:55,129 --> 00:13:00,044
This should be a warning:
if other irresponsibles will dare,

85
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:03,684
...now they'll know what sanctions
they're exposed to.

86
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:06,197
Mario, come here.

87
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:11,726
And now, kneel everyone,
says the Captain.

88
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:16,638
You must kneel, you from the first row.
Everyone must be able to see.

89
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:35,519
The people from Naples
can only approve...

90
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:40,085
...and that's why, says the Captain,
applaud!

91
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:43,166
He's filming you for the 'Newsreel'.

92
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:56,923
I'm telling it for your own good:
Applaud!

93
00:13:56,969 --> 00:14:00,120
If not, these one will take you
on also!

94
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:50,566
You mustn't cry.
You mustn't cry!

95
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:54,841
You mustn't cry.

96
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:45,607
<i>Attention, colonel Scholl
has assumed starting today...</i>

97
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:51,838
<i>...the absolute command, with full powers,
of the city of Naples.</i>

98
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:58,806
<i>Civilian and military Italian authorities
will obey his orders.</i>

99
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:36,364
<i>Starting today, State of Siege
is proclaimed...</i>

100
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:42,200
<i>...and curfew will be in place
from 21:00 to 06:00 in the morning.</i>

101
00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:49,837
<i>Everyone possessing arms must
turn them in at the police stations...</i>

102
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:52,438
<i>...under death penalty.</i>

103
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:57,279
<i>These are the orders from the Fuhrer's
General Staff Command.</i>

104
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:21,481
<i>Attention, for military reasons,
all inhabitants of the buildings...</i>

105
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:28,765
<i>...along the coast line,
up to 300 meters from the sea...</i>

106
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:33,883
<i>...must immediately evacuate their
dwellings.</i>

107
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:41,483
<i>Who will be found in the prohibited zone
will be punished...</i>

108
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:44,965
<i>...according to German military laws.</i>

109
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:03,288
- Let us through!
- Clear the way!

110
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:10,525
- Give me your handbag.
How are you feeling?
- Better.

111
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:15,281
I feel better.

112
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:38,806
Put everything in the tub.
Wait, the canary!

113
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:41,761
We almost forgot the canary.

114
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,247
You take it, mother! What are you doing?

115
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:23,366
I'm sorry, have you seen my husband?
Umberto! Where can he be?

116
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:30,087
He's driving me mad. Umberto!
Where the hell have you hidden?

117
00:21:30,129 --> 00:21:36,125
- Umberto! Umberto! - Hey, even I am
a mother and have a son!

118
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,639
- Excuse me. - There are moments when he
gets me down, this child!

119
00:21:39,689 --> 00:21:45,559
Let's go, children. Stay close to me,
or you'll get lost.

120
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:50,080
- Where's Assuntina? - I don't know,
mother, she was with you. - My God!

121
00:21:50,129 --> 00:21:53,041
Excuse me, have you seen a child
with braids?

122
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:56,365
Assuntina!

123
00:21:56,609 --> 00:22:01,922
Criminal! If I don't find Assuntina
on the spot... Go look for her!

124
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:18,918
Assuntina, come on!

125
00:22:25,129 --> 00:22:28,326
- Mother!
- Mother, she's there!

126
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:34,088
- Assuntina!
- She's here, ma'am!

127
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:36,478
Here she is.

128
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,045
Take her.

129
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:47,444
Mommy's here. Don't cry.

130
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:53,967
Stay close to me, have you understood?
You, count.

131
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:58,719
1, 2, 3, 4, 5: We're all here.
Ready, we're leaving!

132
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:07,568
- Where are we going?
- I don't know, where the feet will take us.

133
00:23:07,609 --> 00:23:10,248
Let's do what everyone else does.

134
00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:25,838
Mamma mia! Come, let's go.

135
00:23:27,409 --> 00:23:30,526
Drop this spoon.

136
00:23:30,569 --> 00:23:34,642
- Donna Concetta, eat something.
- No, thank you.

137
00:23:34,689 --> 00:23:37,920
A little beans, if not what will you
feed the baby with?

138
00:23:37,969 --> 00:23:43,168
Why are you pressing her? With all this
turmoil, she has no appetite!

139
00:23:43,209 --> 00:23:47,885
I have to go. I must see who can
take me in with the other four.

140
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:55,761
Please, remember you said you
were the oldest.

141
00:23:55,809 --> 00:24:00,360
What did you tell papa?
That you'll take his place.

142
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:02,400
Give me a kiss.

143
00:24:06,329 --> 00:24:10,481
- Grab my skirt. Stay close to me.
- Mother, where are we going?

144
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:16,161
I don't know. We'll find someone to take
us in. We'll try.

145
00:24:16,209 --> 00:24:19,918
Come, on. Eat, eat.

146
00:24:19,969 --> 00:24:23,325
What kind of beans are these?
Red or early?

147
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:25,360
- Early!
- Ah.

148
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:30,119
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. You've only
eaten two beans?!

149
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:33,844
Eat, kid! Now you're starting? Eat!

150
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:39,646
- For a kid early beans are heavy in
the evening. - It's day. - Ah.

151
00:24:41,569 --> 00:24:44,003
Come on, eat. Come on.

152
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:15,167
- Come and listen.
- Wait mother.

153
00:25:16,129 --> 00:25:20,759
- Do you have sons? - Yes, why?
- Don't take them outside.

154
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:25,325
The Germans want to catch all the males
and take them to Germany.

155
00:25:25,369 --> 00:25:28,088
Orders for forced recruitment...

156
00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:32,884
...for all men born between 1910-1925.

157
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:36,717
- Who told you?
- Doesn't matter. It's how I tell you.

158
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:39,920
- I'll go warn Pasqualino.
- What are you waiting for? Run!

159
00:25:40,329 --> 00:25:44,959
Vittoria! - What?
- Don't let the men out!

160
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:51,323
Carmela, Nunziatina, listen carefully,
they want to take the men away!

161
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:55,599
Donna Rosina.

162
00:25:55,729 --> 00:25:58,721
They want to take away our sons.
Spread the word around.

163
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:05,881
Little one, hide your papa!
Tell your husband too!

164
00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:08,921
Run in the square and shout it!

165
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:15,885
Women, hide the men!

166
00:26:24,369 --> 00:26:27,964
The Germans want to take the men away!

167
00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:49,726
Salvatore.

168
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:52,682
Salvatore. Come here.

169
00:26:59,449 --> 00:27:01,440
Quickly.

170
00:27:03,609 --> 00:27:09,559
- Where are you going? - I'm running away,
I'm afraid.

171
00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:14,041
Who, you? Go back home and hide.

172
00:27:14,609 --> 00:27:16,725
Do it for my sake.

173
00:27:17,489 --> 00:27:21,448
Why? You care about me?
You often think at me?

174
00:27:21,489 --> 00:27:26,404
You can't have these thoughts anymore,
now you've got a husband and children.

175
00:27:31,489 --> 00:27:34,640
Damn, this key! I never find when
I look for it.

176
00:27:34,689 --> 00:27:38,125
- If I knock, the baby will awake.
- Maria!

177
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:43,926
<i>- Disaster. Maria, come! The baby's crying!
- Coming!</i>

178
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:34,923
If you are a man, shouldn't stick
these manifesto.

179
00:28:34,969 --> 00:28:38,757
These things they should do it themselves,
with their own hands.

180
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:43,041
Salvatore, don't raise your voice.
They understand Italian.

181
00:28:49,169 --> 00:28:55,483
- You shouldn't stick them.
- But you don't know the Germans.

182
00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:04,760
What is he trying to prove? It's here
he wants to play the dare devil?

183
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:08,119
- That one's trying to get in trouble.
- Or get us in trouble.

184
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:10,558
How nice it is to play the hero!

185
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:14,443
But don't you think at all the people
that could get caught in this?

186
00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:19,847
The hero! Don't make me laugh!
He's a delinquent, he's in the Camorra.

187
00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:22,483
Close the window.

188
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:32,247
A big deal they'll get with me!
Paternity: ---. Profession: ---.

189
00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:35,759
Come on, Salvatore.
All!

190
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:40,325
- They want to count all Neapolitans.
- Good day.

191
00:29:42,889 --> 00:29:44,925
Present!

192
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:48,286
<i>Brother, do you have a potato for us?</i>

193
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:51,446
If I had one, would I give it to you?!

194
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:55,277
<i>But the Almighty could spare a thought
even for us!</i>

195
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:57,843
<i>What's a potato for the Almighty?</i>

196
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:21,800
You don't know how it's like leaving
your children in different houses!

197
00:30:21,849 --> 00:30:28,004
What are you doing, fool? Down!
We're in the middle of the street!

198
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:33,407
<i>Radio London, Colonel Stevens
speaking. Good evening</i>

199
00:30:33,449 --> 00:30:35,565
Good evening to you.

200
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:39,397
<i>Not one Neapolitan has come forward
force the forced labour.</i>

201
00:30:39,449 --> 00:30:42,919
<i>American troops have reached
Torre Annunziata.</i>

202
00:30:42,969 --> 00:30:46,245
My God, Torre Annunziata!
Half an hour by train!

203
00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:50,043
Yes, but those ones go by foot,
and they don't run!

204
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:55,243
- Friend, the game!
- Come in. - If I may.

205
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:59,487
<i>Yesterday, in the Sanità district,
a woman was killed.</i>

206
00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:02,327
Holy Virgin! A few steps away!

207
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:07,489
But how come he knows it,
him being in London?

208
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:11,486
<i>Neapolitans, defend...</i>

209
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:23,008
What precision! They seem to go
by a time table!

210
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:27,083
Jesus and Mary! Are you not Don Giovanni?

211
00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:37,077
The Blessed Virgin has granted her grace!
Your husband is back.

212
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:39,438
Giovanni!

213
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:43,845
Giovanni! You've come back!

214
00:35:02,569 --> 00:35:08,599
- Don't cry anymore.
- And you, why are you crying?

215
00:35:17,209 --> 00:35:20,724
Don't hold me so tight,
or I'll faint.

216
00:35:20,769 --> 00:35:23,203
I've got wounds and I hurt all over.

217
00:35:26,969 --> 00:35:31,042
I had forgotten how a bed was made.

218
00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:52,918
Let me sleep first.

219
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,361
Come here, handsome.

220
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:07,803
You can't imagine what it means.
I haven't slept for 100 hours.

221
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:11,478
You are clean now, you can kiss him
as much as you want.

222
00:36:11,529 --> 00:36:16,080
- Come to daddy.
- It's daddy, go.

223
00:36:16,129 --> 00:36:22,284
Come to daddy. What does it mean?
That's how you're celebrating your daddy?

224
00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:26,208
It's the beard!
Do you want to shave it off?

225
00:36:26,249 --> 00:36:29,400
Do you want me to look for a razor blade?

226
00:36:30,169 --> 00:36:32,922
And I'll look for something to eat too.

227
00:36:32,969 --> 00:36:38,202
Come, handsome. It's not that I'm bad.

228
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:44,157
I'd like to stay and look at you
until tomorrow...

229
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:47,766
...but my eyes are shutting down.

230
00:36:48,529 --> 00:36:53,603
How tired I am!
Have patience...

231
00:37:53,489 --> 00:37:58,768
Let me go! What have we done?

232
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:04,327
Who are you looking for? It's not we!

233
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:21,838
Where are you taking me? I'm a veteran!
I was in the war!

234
00:38:21,889 --> 00:38:24,403
One moment, let me take my pants.

235
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:50,160
<i>Gaetano, what are you doing, getting out?</i>

236
00:38:52,449 --> 00:38:55,600
No! Gaetano.

237
00:39:11,089 --> 00:39:13,159
The proclamation doesn't concern me!

238
00:39:13,209 --> 00:39:17,088
The registry says I was born on the
2nd of January 1905...

239
00:39:17,129 --> 00:39:21,247
...but in fact I was born on the
25th of December 1904!

240
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:25,441
Cavalier Gennari, who has held me at my
baptism can confirm it.

241
00:39:26,129 --> 00:39:31,328
Heil Hitler. Heil Mussolini.
I've always been a fascist!

242
00:39:31,689 --> 00:39:35,967
- I swear! - Arnaldo! - You tell them
I'm a fascist! - Arnaldo!

243
00:39:36,009 --> 00:39:42,164
Arnaldo, I want to go with you.
Where are you taking him?

244
00:39:42,689 --> 00:39:45,283
Arnaldo, you're mine.

245
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:49,766
I'm also a fascist! But how do you
say "fascist" in German?

246
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:54,724
The proclamation doesn't concern me!
What are these manners?
Where do you think you are?

247
00:40:03,049 --> 00:40:07,486
- How is Assuntina?
- I've told you already, she's fine.

248
00:40:07,529 --> 00:40:11,966
- But don't let her see you, or
she'll start crying. - You're right.

249
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:16,719
You've wisen up. War maked you grow-up,
isn't it?

250
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:26,679
Easy. Eat it here, if not, if they see it,
they'll take it away.

251
00:40:47,969 --> 00:40:50,767
But you don't want some?

252
00:41:01,849 --> 00:41:03,646
Taste a little.

253
00:41:07,649 --> 00:41:12,677
Only to see if they are good.
If you'd only know where I've found them!

254
00:41:21,009 --> 00:41:23,000
Here.

255
00:41:26,449 --> 00:41:29,168
Now it's better I go.

256
00:41:29,209 --> 00:41:33,361
Mother, when will we
live together again?

257
00:41:36,049 --> 00:41:39,280
Here, give it to Assuntina.

258
00:41:41,689 --> 00:41:44,408
Please, don't eat it.

259
00:42:00,369 --> 00:42:06,638
Ma'am, tell my mother:
Colletta Teresa.

260
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:45,167
- Where are they taking us now?
- To play foot.

261
00:42:51,289 --> 00:42:55,760
Have you seen my son?
He's name is Mario. He has auburn hair.

262
00:42:55,809 --> 00:43:03,079
He's tall and skinny. Has auburn hair.
His name is Mario.

263
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:13,243
- That manifesto is only a lie.
- You're wrong!

264
00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:17,885
- Let it be known we're still alive.
He's skinny! - But what can I do?

265
00:43:18,289 --> 00:43:21,918
- What are these manners? - Good day,
ingegnere. - Good day, avvocato.

266
00:43:22,729 --> 00:43:25,197
Where are they taking you? To Germany?

267
00:43:25,249 --> 00:43:30,164
Colletta Teresa.

268
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:32,439
Give us back our men!

269
00:44:47,569 --> 00:44:51,767
The Blessed Virgin be with you.
Let's go!

270
00:45:06,049 --> 00:45:08,040
Stop!

271
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:13,725
Wait!

272
00:45:45,329 --> 00:45:50,119
Damn it, I thought we were the only ones
having this idea!

273
00:45:50,729 --> 00:45:55,678
- They all want to go to Sorrento.
- The Americans must be there already.

274
00:45:55,729 --> 00:45:58,368
I don't care if the Americans have come...

275
00:45:58,409 --> 00:46:02,118
...I want to know if my son has been born.

276
00:46:02,169 --> 00:46:06,765
- Let's find another boat. - Where will
you find another madman to take you?

277
00:46:06,809 --> 00:46:09,642
- We must find him.
- The Germans! The Germans!

278
00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:54,319
The taxi! Curse your souls, what are
you doing? Are you mad?

279
00:48:55,209 --> 00:48:58,918
You had to shoot right here? Go make
war somewhere else.

280
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:01,358
Right in my taxi?!

281
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:06,198
Do you want to go away,
once and for all?

282
00:49:09,689 --> 00:49:11,680
Jesus, he's dead!

283
00:49:41,529 --> 00:49:44,919
Enough. Enough, wait.

284
00:49:58,449 --> 00:50:01,441
He's dead. Give me a hand.

285
00:50:05,889 --> 00:50:10,724
- Oh, Blessed Mary. - Easy. Be careful.
- Let's put him on the roof.

286
00:50:17,409 --> 00:50:21,243
- Come here, help me.
- Let's take the other one.

287
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:28,162
Easy, easy.

288
00:50:39,609 --> 00:50:41,804
For these innocent souls...

289
00:50:41,849 --> 00:50:45,922
Come on, let's get down!

290
00:50:46,289 --> 00:50:49,440
Go, taxi.

291
00:50:50,329 --> 00:50:57,041
Neapolitans, show yourselves. See what the
Germans have done.

292
00:50:57,089 --> 00:51:00,638
Take this, Giovanni!

293
00:51:00,689 --> 00:51:03,840
- Neapolitans, show yourselves.
- Give it to me.

294
00:51:03,889 --> 00:51:10,442
- Neapolitans, open your windows,
get out. - We must revenge them

295
00:51:10,489 --> 00:51:13,561
See what the
Germans have done.

296
00:51:13,609 --> 00:51:16,840
We must revenge our poor brothers.

297
00:51:16,889 --> 00:51:20,040
Get out, get out!
They've died for you.

298
00:51:55,969 --> 00:52:00,042
Long live Naples.
Death to the Germans

299
00:52:00,729 --> 00:52:04,847
Neapolitans, these dead are calling
for you, they're here for you.

300
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:08,928
Neapolitans, don't hide!
Get down.

301
00:52:16,449 --> 00:52:20,044
Wait, I'll go with you.

302
00:52:25,649 --> 00:52:31,087
<i>Let's save Naples. Neapolitans, don't
play smart.</i>

303
00:52:31,129 --> 00:52:36,442
You're mad! What got into your heads?

304
00:52:53,609 --> 00:52:59,047
The other one has torn clothes.
I have good ones...

305
00:53:00,409 --> 00:53:02,400
What does it matter now?

306
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:05,885
<i>Anastasio's dead.</i>

307
00:53:05,929 --> 00:53:09,842
Doctor! Doctor!

308
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:15,327
Doctor! Let me see him

309
00:53:27,929 --> 00:53:29,965
Let me go!

310
00:53:34,849 --> 00:53:38,728
No, it's not him.

311
00:53:40,089 --> 00:53:43,638
Thank you, Holy Virgin.

312
00:53:45,049 --> 00:53:48,439
Who knows whose poor mother
he was the son.

313
00:53:50,449 --> 00:53:56,604
- Have you tried finding her?
- He had no documents.

314
00:53:56,649 --> 00:53:59,209
Let me through.
- What is it?

315
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:04,164
There's a rumour going on there's a
young man dead who's unknown.

316
00:54:06,809 --> 00:54:11,485
Good riddance. It's been three days since
I was looking for that swine.

317
00:54:12,489 --> 00:54:16,164
Oh, Jesus! He has such an angel's face!

318
00:54:16,209 --> 00:54:21,283
What were their sins to have
died so young?

319
00:54:21,329 --> 00:54:26,687
This war was almost over!
Jesus! Jesus!

320
00:54:27,569 --> 00:54:32,563
How could this happen?

321
00:54:34,889 --> 00:54:40,043
This morning you were alive,
and I won't see you again.

322
00:54:42,089 --> 00:54:48,608
Treacherous son, why have you left me?

323
00:54:50,689 --> 00:54:57,367
- Why? - Ma'am, you want to take him
away during curfew?

324
00:54:59,449 --> 00:55:02,168
That's what his father wants.

325
00:55:03,329 --> 00:55:08,562
Arturo, daddy's coming now
and all three of us will go home.

326
00:55:09,929 --> 00:55:14,719
Did you hear, Arturo?
Did you hear your mother?

327
00:55:15,929 --> 00:55:19,478
Excuse me. Please.

328
00:55:24,649 --> 00:55:30,565
- Who were you afraid for? - I've got three
brothers, three despairs.

329
00:55:30,609 --> 00:55:34,966
We are looking for them and we
are worried.

330
00:55:35,849 --> 00:55:42,846
War, always the war.
And dead laughing in your face.

331
00:55:43,209 --> 00:55:45,200
Allow me.

332
00:55:47,289 --> 00:55:51,999
- We must take him away like this.
- What do you mean? - On our arms.

333
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:57,248
- I haven't found a cart.
- Do you need help? - Yes, thank you.

334
00:55:57,289 --> 00:56:03,285
Wait. Easy, easy.
Easy, don't hurt my son.

335
00:56:03,329 --> 00:56:10,724
My son! Wait. Where's the handkerchief?

336
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:18,921
I'm sorry. My handsome...

337
00:56:20,769 --> 00:56:25,240
- Do you want me to accompany you?
- No, thank you very much.

338
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:27,405
I'll take him, easy, easy.

339
00:56:27,449 --> 00:56:31,283
Have you seen how beautiful is my son?

340
00:56:32,649 --> 00:56:38,679
You should have pity on me, I feel he's
more pleased to be at his home.

341
00:56:49,569 --> 00:56:53,687
Wait, I'll help you.

342
00:57:01,089 --> 00:57:06,288
What a procession! This night, despite
the curfew, half of Naples comes.

343
00:57:06,329 --> 00:57:09,526
<i>Woe on her who recognizes him!</i>

344
00:57:13,289 --> 00:57:17,248
- Is that the house?
- It's the only lit door.

345
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:30,042
- What happened? - Don't you know?
Two boys have died.

346
00:57:30,689 --> 00:57:33,681
In a shoot out with the Germans!

347
00:57:34,729 --> 00:57:39,803
<i>There even were 5-6 armed Christians.
Mamma mia! Germans?</i>

348
00:57:39,849 --> 00:57:43,444
I've said Christians. Like us!

349
00:57:44,809 --> 00:57:48,882
Imagine if every Neapolitan would take
upon himself to kill a German.

350
00:57:48,929 --> 00:57:53,241
It's like how they say:
"If everyone puts down a lira...".

351
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:57,000
They say it, but don't do it.

352
00:57:57,049 --> 00:58:03,648
- Pitrella, are you sure this is the
place? - I think so.

353
00:58:04,169 --> 00:58:07,445
Ah, there's something written down here.

354
00:58:07,769 --> 00:58:12,047
- Here! A little backwards.
- Give me a hand.

355
00:58:13,369 --> 00:58:16,679
- Who is it?
- Silence. - The Lieutenant!

356
00:58:16,729 --> 00:58:20,722
Isn't it here that we've hidden the arms?

357
00:58:32,969 --> 00:58:36,848
What are you waiting for? Come on,
keep digging.

358
00:58:36,929 --> 00:58:40,399
I'm sorry, maybe you wanted to say it.

359
00:58:48,729 --> 00:58:51,846
Do you have a riffle for me?

360
00:58:51,889 --> 00:58:57,009
You had a revolver. Look for it.
Everyone takes his stuff.

361
00:59:06,049 --> 00:59:08,040
Come, write.

362
00:59:09,329 --> 00:59:12,526
"People of Naples..." No.

363
00:59:12,569 --> 00:59:19,327
"People of Vommero, the hour of the
insurrection has come."

364
00:59:20,009 --> 00:59:24,480
"Let's fight the Germans,
let's save our loved ones..."

365
00:59:24,529 --> 00:59:27,726
"...from deportation and death."

366
00:59:27,769 --> 00:59:32,763
Professor, these are beautiful words,
but what are we when facing the Germans?

367
00:59:32,809 --> 00:59:37,041
- They have guns, tanks!
- Yes, sure.

368
00:59:37,089 --> 00:59:40,923
- Where were we? - It lacks the signature.
- Ah, the signature.

369
00:59:40,969 --> 00:59:44,962
With what right should I sign it?
Who am I?

370
00:59:45,009 --> 00:59:51,881
- What do you mean?
You're the Commander!
- Yes, a Commander full of shit!

371
01:00:13,089 --> 01:00:17,685
Five soldiers have been killed. Execute
50 hostages. Colonel Scholl's orders.

372
01:00:21,726 --> 01:00:23,300
We'll need a machine-gun.

373
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:27,412
It's the only way to deter attacks.
Is it clear?

374
01:00:28,832 --> 01:00:32,284
Bring the Italians here, the firing
squad will take position on the field.

375
01:00:38,169 --> 01:00:42,048
What do they want now?
They can't leave me alone.

376
01:00:42,089 --> 01:00:47,004
The Americans are at Capri,
at Ischia, and are going away?

377
01:00:47,049 --> 01:00:51,406
- Where can I do a little something.
- Go there! Who's watching you?

378
01:00:51,449 --> 01:00:54,043
- I'm ashamed!
- Go!

379
01:00:55,169 --> 01:00:57,637
- Wanna' make a game?
- No!

380
01:00:57,689 --> 01:01:00,761
Hey, you want to play?

381
01:01:01,249 --> 01:01:06,642
Please, I'm so tired,
I haven't slept in 100 hours.

382
01:01:06,689 --> 01:01:11,922
It almost makes me cry. That's where
they had to take me? Close to my house!

383
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:17,646
- I've got a wife and child!
- Try calling for them. - Better not.

384
01:01:18,809 --> 01:01:22,438
Want to play a hand to make time go by?

385
01:01:22,489 --> 01:01:26,641
No, thanks, I'll do a solitaire.

386
01:03:02,889 --> 01:03:05,687
What are they doing?

387
01:03:05,729 --> 01:03:10,757
No! Not like this, damn it
Give it to me. Like this.

388
01:03:10,809 --> 01:03:13,846
You take this.

389
01:03:13,889 --> 01:03:19,282
- Professor! - What? - This gentleman
wants to speak to you.

390
01:03:19,969 --> 01:03:23,484
- What does he want? Who sent him?
- I've read your proclamation.

391
01:03:23,529 --> 01:03:26,089
Captain, nobody called you, soldiers, in.

392
01:03:26,129 --> 01:03:30,566
This are the arms you have thrown
when running away.

393
01:03:30,609 --> 01:03:36,684
- Where have you been until now?
- In Yugoslavia, in Albania, in Russia!

394
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:40,688
Certainly not to please me, and always
stoopping in front of the Germans!

395
01:03:55,529 --> 01:03:57,679
I'm a fascist!

396
01:03:57,729 --> 01:04:01,688
I'm a fascist!

397
01:04:01,729 --> 01:04:06,439
I'm a fascist!
Holy Virgin, they want to kill us!

398
01:04:07,049 --> 01:04:11,042
They want to kill us like
we were animals!

399
01:04:12,809 --> 01:04:17,758
- Stay close to me. - Yes.
- Stay close. Give me your hand.

400
01:04:30,129 --> 01:04:35,522
Shoot! Don't stop! They must think
there are a lot of us!

401
01:04:35,569 --> 01:04:39,005
<i>Maybe we'll save them! Shoot!</i>

402
01:04:47,929 --> 01:04:50,727
Go on shooting, I'm going down.

403
01:04:52,969 --> 01:04:55,642
You two, come with me!

404
01:05:10,289 --> 01:05:14,567
- Go way!
- We won't move from here.

405
01:05:14,609 --> 01:05:17,043
It's ours that are inside.

406
01:05:19,289 --> 01:05:21,200
Professor, stop!

407
01:05:22,409 --> 01:05:25,162
Stop! Professor!

408
01:05:25,929 --> 01:05:27,999
Soldiers!

409
01:05:28,569 --> 01:05:31,083
German soldiers!

410
01:05:37,169 --> 01:05:39,160
Soldiers!

411
01:06:24,249 --> 01:06:29,687
- Move! - Move!
- Come!

412
01:06:39,569 --> 01:06:43,528
- Are we stopping here or what?
- No, we go forward!

413
01:06:43,569 --> 01:06:46,959
No, here!
Those go to Vommero!

414
01:06:49,009 --> 01:06:53,958
Why do you shoot here? Go make
war at your houses!

415
01:06:54,009 --> 01:06:57,718
Don't you say anything? Go shoot wherever
you want, but not here.

416
01:06:57,769 --> 01:07:00,602
You must go away, we want to be left
alone. I'm telling you.

417
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:04,119
- Leave, before the Germans come.
- That's why we're here!

418
01:07:04,169 --> 01:07:07,844
- You must leave immediately!
- The Germans!

419
01:08:21,529 --> 01:08:25,204
Totò! How come? You had gone out
to buy bread!

420
01:08:25,249 --> 01:08:28,321
You can't make war next to your wife!

421
01:08:28,369 --> 01:08:32,601
I can't live without you, I have to be
at your side. Do you love, Totò?

422
01:08:32,649 --> 01:08:38,201
- Don't stick to me!
- Totò, you always exaggerate!

423
01:09:19,609 --> 01:09:22,043
- With the marble?
- Yes, with the marble!

424
01:09:30,969 --> 01:09:34,757
What are you doing, moron? Not my bed!
Take something else!

425
01:09:43,409 --> 01:09:48,278
We've stopped them.
We've made it.

426
01:09:50,849 --> 01:09:53,568
I'm hungry!
Thief! He has full sacks of flower.

427
01:09:56,089 --> 01:10:00,526
It's useless threatening, you'll
find nothing inside!

428
01:10:00,569 --> 01:10:06,678
Baking has been stopped!
I don't have flower! I don't have anything!

429
01:10:06,729 --> 01:10:09,766
We want to see. If they don't give,
we'll take it!

430
01:10:09,809 --> 01:10:14,007
- Excuse me. - Doctor, I was looking for
you. I have a tooth that's killing me.

431
01:10:14,049 --> 01:10:16,563
Cicillo, I must try and get some bread!

432
01:10:16,609 --> 01:10:21,967
I've shot the Germans,
I can also shoot you!

433
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:24,603
Pull my tooth out! Doctor!

434
01:10:24,649 --> 01:10:28,927
Cicillo. Is it true you have shot?

435
01:10:28,969 --> 01:10:32,086
Him no, but them yes.

436
01:10:32,129 --> 01:10:34,848
- Them who? - Salvatore and some
50 more people.

437
01:10:34,889 --> 01:10:36,959
- Where?
- Above the districts.

438
01:10:42,969 --> 01:10:45,005
The Germans!

439
01:10:46,049 --> 01:10:51,077
Comrades, here, help me!

440
01:11:04,049 --> 01:11:08,327
Cicillo! Wait for me!

441
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:15,078
Come on, Maria, run!

442
01:11:20,729 --> 01:11:26,326
Go away! Take this woman away,
they'll be shooting here soon!

443
01:11:26,369 --> 01:11:31,363
- The cartridges. - Stay here.
- Find cartridges.

444
01:11:34,689 --> 01:11:37,328
Where did you take this red marked
cartridges from?!

445
01:11:37,369 --> 01:11:41,840
The Germans. Give me cartridges. What
are you doing? Give me the cartridges!

446
01:11:41,889 --> 01:11:47,009
- I don't think they're good. - Yes,
they are, I took them from barracks!

447
01:11:47,049 --> 01:11:48,801
Let's go!

448
01:11:57,569 --> 01:12:01,005
Attack! We're not afraid!

449
01:12:01,049 --> 01:12:03,802
We're not afraid.

450
01:12:05,729 --> 01:12:08,641
Maria, go away.

451
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:37,721
Christ! These are blanks!

452
01:12:37,769 --> 01:12:43,639
- These are blanks, boys! Run!
- These are blanks! Open! Open!

453
01:12:47,729 --> 01:12:49,526
Francesco.

454
01:12:53,249 --> 01:12:56,764
Cicillo, you heard?
Comei! Run!

455
01:12:58,369 --> 01:13:02,601
What are you doing here? I told you to
go away! Runaway, Maria.

456
01:13:02,649 --> 01:13:05,402
Please, get out of here!

457
01:13:53,809 --> 01:13:57,518
Salvatore, I didn't think I'd
find you.

458
01:13:58,129 --> 01:14:04,443
- What do you want? - Nothing. - It's
sheer madness. Go back home!

459
01:14:04,489 --> 01:14:09,927
It's madness! All this people
shooting and dying!

460
01:14:10,249 --> 01:14:14,561
- You mustn't die. - Go back home.
Why have you come?

461
01:14:14,609 --> 01:14:17,840
No. Salvatore, you mustn't die,
understand?

462
01:14:38,129 --> 01:14:42,407
I've just seen one of your friends die.

463
01:14:42,449 --> 01:14:46,203
- What friend?
- Cicillo.

464
01:14:47,369 --> 01:14:51,408
I've seen him die with my own eyes.

465
01:14:57,809 --> 01:15:03,008
Assassins, you must die too.
Swines, you must die.

466
01:15:55,329 --> 01:15:59,720
- Look at the second floor.
- That window. - Ah, yes!

467
01:16:02,569 --> 01:16:06,357
- Take a gun, run!
- Let's go, the guns!

468
01:16:06,409 --> 01:16:09,799
- Come on, let's show them who we are.
- And who are we?

469
01:16:09,849 --> 01:16:13,603
We are all sons of the "androcchia"!

470
01:16:14,809 --> 01:16:18,927
Take the guns and be careful,
'cause they're shooting!

471
01:16:36,729 --> 01:16:41,280
- Give us Ajello.
- Give us Ajello.

472
01:16:41,729 --> 01:16:45,847
Ajello, we've come to take you.

473
01:16:49,649 --> 01:16:51,799
Come on, let's get out!

474
01:17:03,889 --> 01:17:05,880
Ajello!

475
01:17:07,009 --> 01:17:12,561
Ajello, wait! Ajello!

476
01:17:14,929 --> 01:17:17,921
Stop! We'll shoot!

477
01:17:24,529 --> 01:17:28,920
Thank God there's no law,
no police...

478
01:17:28,969 --> 01:17:34,965
...and that bombs are falling,
otherwise you'd have never gotten out.

479
01:17:35,009 --> 01:17:39,560
But be careful, 'cause sooner or later
you'll be back here!

480
01:17:40,169 --> 01:17:43,286
I won't go before you.

481
01:17:43,329 --> 01:17:47,766
And who's going out with me,
stays with me.

482
01:17:47,809 --> 01:17:52,166
Yes, well done! Play the hero,
do the camorrista!

483
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:55,997
I know you well, and what you're
capable of!

484
01:17:56,049 --> 01:18:01,407
Steal, rape, kill,
you're always ready for it.

485
01:18:03,409 --> 01:18:06,799
Ajello, you've still got time.

486
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:11,559
What's this shit!
Talk, talk... Let's go

487
01:18:24,609 --> 01:18:29,319
Where are we going? Sack the city?
Who shall we make cry?

488
01:18:29,369 --> 01:18:32,327
We must go to war!

489
01:18:33,129 --> 01:18:35,848
And show who we are.

490
01:18:38,289 --> 01:18:42,567
- Who's this one?
- I don't know. Where do you come from?
- From Margellina.

491
01:18:42,609 --> 01:18:47,125
- Margellina, wanna come or not?
- Wanna get lost?

492
01:18:47,169 --> 01:18:51,526
- Get lost, I don't want to see you anymore!
- Why, what are you doing?

493
01:18:53,289 --> 01:18:57,726
Mister, please, where's the war?

494
01:18:57,769 --> 01:19:03,002
I don't know, it's a moving war:
now's here, then is there.

495
01:19:05,729 --> 01:19:08,197
Let's go!

496
01:19:22,729 --> 01:19:25,527
They are getting out!

497
01:19:25,569 --> 01:19:29,528
Forward. Ready.

498
01:19:30,049 --> 01:19:34,440
Please, go away!

499
01:19:34,729 --> 01:19:40,247
There's nothing to see. Please,
don't stay here!

500
01:19:42,169 --> 01:19:44,922
<i>Don't shoot! Listen to me!</i>

501
01:19:44,969 --> 01:19:49,918
<i>The major says that if you don't surrender
they'll shoot the hostages.</i>

502
01:19:49,969 --> 01:19:54,599
<i>They'd shoot innocents.
What have we done to you?</i>

503
01:19:54,649 --> 01:19:58,608
We're all innocents here,
and we're making war!

504
01:19:58,649 --> 01:20:02,119
<i>- Tell your Nazi friend...
- What friend?<i?</i>

505
01:20:02,169 --> 01:20:07,163
Those are bastards! But even you,
try to understand!

506
01:20:07,209 --> 01:20:11,327
There's no need to surrender
just go one by one.

507
01:20:11,369 --> 01:20:14,008
Tell him to give up, he and all his men.

508
01:20:14,049 --> 01:20:18,804
The Neapolitans inside make war
as we do on the outside.

509
01:20:39,209 --> 01:20:41,200
Arnaldo!

510
01:20:41,609 --> 01:20:48,924
Arnaldo! Oh, my God! Arnaldo!

511
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:57,001
What have they done to you, my love?
They've killed him!

512
01:20:57,289 --> 01:20:59,325
A truck's coming out. There are some
of ours to.

513
01:20:59,369 --> 01:21:02,725
Professor, they're ready to get out,
with hostages covering them.

514
01:21:02,769 --> 01:21:07,285
Captain, the Germans are getting
out with a truck.

515
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:10,082
They're hiding behind ours.

516
01:21:11,249 --> 01:21:15,879
- Shoot all the same.
- No, no don't shoot. - Let me go!

517
01:21:15,929 --> 01:21:21,287
- There are our loved ones in there.
- If you shoot, we'll get in front.

518
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:24,446
Shoot the tires!

519
01:21:29,689 --> 01:21:31,998
Shoot! Shoot!

520
01:21:59,169 --> 01:22:01,683
Vicenzo, what have they done to you?

521
01:22:01,729 --> 01:22:05,768
The Captain is an assassin!

522
01:22:11,769 --> 01:22:16,126
Stop shooting.
Stop shooting.

523
01:22:16,969 --> 01:22:19,608
Stop shooting.

524
01:22:50,609 --> 01:22:55,922
- Why do I get only half a biscuit?
- You're smaller, and less hungry.

525
01:22:55,969 --> 01:23:00,042
- The kid woke up!
- All to the war!

526
01:23:00,089 --> 01:23:05,800
Don't you drink? We only had one hour
of water, and where were you?

527
01:23:05,849 --> 01:23:08,841
- I was at war!
- And these, where are you taking them?

528
01:23:08,889 --> 01:23:13,121
- We are the army Giovanni
Ajello! - And who's this Ajello?

529
01:23:13,169 --> 01:23:16,559
Keep your hands down!

530
01:23:16,609 --> 01:23:19,123
These are our prisoners.

531
01:23:19,169 --> 01:23:25,199
Alright, they're yours, but can I
kick them in the butt?

532
01:23:25,249 --> 01:23:29,162
But only one.

533
01:23:36,249 --> 01:23:41,642
Let it go, they are prisoners of war.

534
01:23:42,449 --> 01:23:47,443
Enough! Leave them alone!
Let's get back at t he queue.

535
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:51,243
- Move it, get back in the line.
- I was first.

536
01:23:51,289 --> 01:23:56,238
- I'll say who's first and who's not.
- When's water coming?

537
01:23:56,289 --> 01:24:00,202
Soon. Tomorrow, or after tomorrow,
the latest.

538
01:24:42,249 --> 01:24:45,878
I've killed him.
Holy Virgin I've killed him!

539
01:24:45,929 --> 01:24:50,207
Who'd have thought that today I'll
have killed a man?

540
01:24:50,249 --> 01:24:54,128
I've never killed a fly, and now I've
killed a German.

541
01:24:54,169 --> 01:24:56,888
How many Neapolitans will have to die!

542
01:24:59,929 --> 01:25:03,080
A hundred, they say. Don't cry.

543
01:25:03,729 --> 01:25:06,880
For 100 dead Neapolitans,
we want 1000 Germans dead.

544
01:25:20,089 --> 01:25:26,483
Christ, shouldn't we move?
We've been pulling it for 4 hours!

545
01:25:26,529 --> 01:25:30,044
I'm dying, I can't make it anymore.

546
01:25:30,089 --> 01:25:37,359
- Push! - Come on! - Push!
- Come, lazy! - Pull!

547
01:25:40,049 --> 01:25:43,439
What are you doing, walking around at
this hour with this gun?

548
01:25:43,489 --> 01:25:47,368
They're shooting at you!
Where are you taking it?

549
01:25:47,409 --> 01:25:50,765
- Salutami "a soreta"!
- Incredible!

550
01:25:50,889 --> 01:25:56,805
- Forward, with all our strength!
- What strength?

551
01:25:57,849 --> 01:26:00,886
- Come here.
- Who's in charge?

552
01:26:02,729 --> 01:26:08,440
- The Lieutenant. - After, when we'll
shoot. Now, I'm giving orders.

553
01:26:08,489 --> 01:26:13,438
You pull here, you push here
and you there!

554
01:26:13,489 --> 01:26:18,085
Pull! Pull! Let's go!

555
01:26:18,329 --> 01:26:22,527
Pull! Pull!

556
01:26:57,849 --> 01:27:02,365
Who knows if these are thunders
or bombs.

557
01:27:02,409 --> 01:27:05,640
Make me laugh. Complaining about the
filth.

558
01:27:05,689 --> 01:27:08,487
They have only to call the sweepers
and they'll take everything away.

559
01:27:08,529 --> 01:27:13,319
For shelled house you need
more than a broom.

560
01:27:16,009 --> 01:27:21,845
I like you. Do you have kids?

561
01:27:22,729 --> 01:27:28,122
- No. - It's a sin. You must.

562
01:27:28,169 --> 01:27:34,608
- Are you joking? With a beautiful
girl like her...! - Professor!

563
01:27:34,729 --> 01:27:41,601
The lady is not my wife. She' married
to an honourable person!

564
01:27:41,649 --> 01:27:47,406
With an accountant's degree and
a knight's cross on his chest.

565
01:27:50,049 --> 01:27:52,722
Don't torment yourself.

566
01:27:53,769 --> 01:27:58,604
Think only that we're together and that
if it wasn't for this mess...

567
01:27:58,649 --> 01:28:03,359
Ah, I got it. Then, we should
thank the Germans?

568
01:28:03,409 --> 01:28:06,640
<i>Please, make way.
Let us through.</i>

569
01:28:19,249 --> 01:28:24,926
We got Germans, open!
Will you open or what?

570
01:28:24,969 --> 01:28:28,928
- We got Germans.
- And we're also hungry.

571
01:28:28,969 --> 01:28:33,406
Let's put them in a safe place, boys.
We're going in now, but then we'll go out!

572
01:28:40,449 --> 01:28:44,965
Come on, get in! It's fine inside.

573
01:28:55,609 --> 01:29:00,399
- They're safe in my cell.
- Yours?! Have you bought it?

574
01:29:00,449 --> 01:29:04,761
Let's pretend it's mine.
Mine and the warden's.

575
01:29:04,809 --> 01:29:09,166
Because only him and me don't ever
had any house!

576
01:29:38,169 --> 01:29:40,364
You give it to them.

577
01:29:43,729 --> 01:29:47,278
I have a house and from the bog
you can see the sea.

578
01:29:47,329 --> 01:29:50,605
Fine nostalgia to have when
we're eating!

579
01:29:51,249 --> 01:29:55,481
- You have even taken this kid.
- He's name is Cazzillo.

580
01:29:56,529 --> 01:30:00,078
- Where's your home?
- In Margellina.

581
01:30:00,129 --> 01:30:04,088
- It's a nice house and from the bog...
- Another pants shitter.

582
01:30:04,129 --> 01:30:06,689
Always in mother's lap.

583
01:30:07,969 --> 01:30:13,680
Now I'm all alone. There's no one
at home. Not even mother.

584
01:30:29,449 --> 01:30:32,646
- These are the last potatoes.
- And tomorrow?

585
01:30:32,689 --> 01:30:36,318
We're leaving! We have a war to make!

586
01:30:36,369 --> 01:30:41,807
It's worse for you,
hidden inside here.

587
01:31:16,129 --> 01:31:19,485
Forward, shoot, courage!

588
01:31:33,929 --> 01:31:36,682
The grenades. Quickly, bring the
grenades!

589
01:31:38,569 --> 01:31:44,439
- Cazzillo, come with us!
- No, he's staying here, at shelter!

590
01:31:52,609 --> 01:31:55,521
No, not like this!
Pull the tab.

591
01:32:28,249 --> 01:32:31,400
Not like this! Ajello!

592
01:32:33,929 --> 01:32:38,241
- What are we doing now?
- Take the stretcher.

593
01:32:39,169 --> 01:32:42,605
We must take him to the hospital.
Careful, don't hurt him.

594
01:32:44,249 --> 01:32:48,083
- Let's hurry! - Yes!
- Put a hand under the head.

595
01:33:09,569 --> 01:33:11,400
What's with this handkerchief?

596
01:33:11,449 --> 01:33:15,567
Let's do like the Red Cross,
they'll let us through like this.

597
01:33:24,529 --> 01:33:27,646
Stop! Dead can wait.

598
01:33:28,569 --> 01:33:34,326
What dead? We're still alive.
Help me. Easy, easy...

599
01:33:45,489 --> 01:33:51,837
<i>I can't take you all!
But where should we go?</i>

600
01:33:52,089 --> 01:33:54,557
Don't you get there's no place?

601
01:33:54,609 --> 01:33:59,888
Doctor, this the warden,
he must be treated!

602
01:33:59,929 --> 01:34:04,286
- There. Still here?
- You have no heart!

603
01:34:26,049 --> 01:34:31,487
<i>Isn't this one a German? - Yes,
look at his boots. - A soldier.</i>

604
01:34:31,529 --> 01:34:36,045
- What's he doin' here? - With all the
young men dying in the street!

605
01:34:36,089 --> 01:34:39,877
- Doctor! - There are not enough beds
even for the Italians!

606
01:34:39,929 --> 01:34:43,160
- Who knows how many has he killed!
- Enough! - What's happened?

607
01:34:43,209 --> 01:34:46,918
Doctor, we're all Christians,
you must save him also.

608
01:34:46,969 --> 01:34:50,598
- That's why we're losing the war!
- We're not making it to kill.

609
01:34:56,369 --> 01:35:00,487
Ajello. Stop.

610
01:35:01,769 --> 01:35:07,162
Listen. You've been in war,
are you satisfied?

611
01:35:07,209 --> 01:35:11,487
Now go back to the institute,
there at least you'll be safe.

612
01:35:11,529 --> 01:35:14,919
And maybe you'll even find some potatoes.

613
01:35:14,969 --> 01:35:20,521
Why are you worrying?! Don't think about it,
try to get well.

614
01:35:22,889 --> 01:35:28,088
I have to tell you something, especially
to you, who are the oldest.

615
01:35:29,609 --> 01:35:32,806
Take him to his mother.

616
01:35:33,369 --> 01:35:39,842
Cazzillo, let them be, they're rogues.

617
01:35:40,649 --> 01:35:46,326
You're too small. Have you seen how
easy it is to die?

618
01:35:47,409 --> 01:35:51,721
Let them be. Do you promise me that?

619
01:35:59,649 --> 01:36:01,765
Make way, kids.

620
01:36:05,569 --> 01:36:08,641
Warden, don't worry, we'll come see you.

621
01:36:08,689 --> 01:36:12,887
- Yes, when you'll be better.
- You'll come visit you, warden!

622
01:36:25,689 --> 01:36:30,046
- Who knows where he's hiding.
Have you seen a child? - No.

623
01:36:30,089 --> 01:36:33,365
This high. I've been looking for
him since yesterday.

624
01:36:33,449 --> 01:36:36,088
- I'm sorry.
- This way.

625
01:36:54,689 --> 01:36:58,318
<i>Cazzillo, move it!</i>

626
01:36:58,809 --> 01:37:01,687
- Have you seen a child? He's name is
Pasqualino. - No, I'm sorry.

627
01:37:33,689 --> 01:37:36,647
I've been all around Naples.

628
01:37:36,689 --> 01:37:42,286
Do you know who children are?
Everyone a pain in the heart.

629
01:37:42,329 --> 01:37:47,528
What days have these been!
How many were there?

630
01:37:47,569 --> 01:37:52,689
Three? I don't know night for
day anymore.

631
01:38:49,489 --> 01:38:53,846
What are you doing?
They're not coming from there!

632
01:38:53,889 --> 01:38:57,165
Stop!
Go back the other way!

633
01:38:57,209 --> 01:39:00,918
- No, we must go forward!
- Who told you so?

634
01:39:00,969 --> 01:39:04,518
Logic did!
We must block the passageway!

635
01:39:04,569 --> 01:39:08,482
Wherever they go, we shoot them!

636
01:39:18,969 --> 01:39:22,200
- Help him up.
- Thanks.

637
01:39:30,769 --> 01:39:33,647
- Where are the Germans coming from?
- From there!

638
01:39:33,689 --> 01:39:36,886
They surely aren't afraid
to get down!

639
01:39:38,049 --> 01:39:40,722
Silence, keep quiet!

640
01:40:17,769 --> 01:40:21,045
Who's the imbecile who told you
the Germans are coming from there?

641
01:40:21,089 --> 01:40:25,287
The tanks are coming
from the back!

642
01:40:25,649 --> 01:40:29,005
The gun's here!

643
01:40:45,929 --> 01:40:48,159
What are you waiting for?
Fire.

644
01:40:48,209 --> 01:40:51,599
You must fix the cannon! You, come here!

645
01:40:56,169 --> 01:41:00,003
Stay covered, or we'll die before
shooting. Take cover.

646
01:41:07,009 --> 01:41:09,000
<i>Come on, charge it!</i>

647
01:41:09,609 --> 01:41:11,918
If the baby's born,
they'll be able to tell it:

648
01:41:11,969 --> 01:41:15,962
..."When you were born there were more
cannon shots than a royal baby."

649
01:42:44,969 --> 01:42:48,200
Sorry, gentlemen,
is this the war?

650
01:42:48,249 --> 01:42:51,844
Have you seen a boy here?
He's name is Ajello.

651
01:42:51,889 --> 01:42:57,327
I don't know! What are you doing
with that machine-gun? Give it to me!

652
01:42:58,049 --> 01:43:03,601
- No, it's mine! I found it!
Give to me! - Go!

653
01:43:05,929 --> 01:43:09,524
- What are you doing here?
- Go away!

654
01:43:19,649 --> 01:43:22,880
- Run! Help us!
- Run and help us!

655
01:43:22,969 --> 01:43:26,439
Go!

656
01:43:38,489 --> 01:43:43,324
- Don't bother with me.
Leave me here. - Let's put Jim here

657
01:43:45,329 --> 01:43:48,082
Easy.

658
01:43:59,209 --> 01:44:08,163
After, when all will be over, do me
a favour.

659
01:44:08,209 --> 01:44:14,364
But after, when it's all over.
Take me to Sorrento.

660
01:44:14,529 --> 01:44:18,158
Because my son is born.

661
01:44:18,209 --> 01:44:20,643
Don't think about it.
I'll be back soon.

662
01:44:20,689 --> 01:44:22,805
<i>Follow me!</i>

663
01:44:23,449 --> 01:44:25,804
Follow me!

664
01:44:42,409 --> 01:44:46,448
- Will you give me my riffle back?
- This is nowhere you should be!

665
01:44:46,489 --> 01:44:49,720
- I've already been at war!
- Who, you?! Are you leaving or not?

666
01:44:49,769 --> 01:44:53,682
- I've fought with Ajello's army, I swear!
- Enough!

667
01:45:07,249 --> 01:45:10,286
Don't shoot, it's a kid.

668
01:45:10,409 --> 01:45:11,842
Stop.

669
01:45:14,689 --> 01:45:20,844
No, please! Don't shoot,
stop! Don't shoot.

670
01:45:49,609 --> 01:45:54,637
- They've killed him. - How can you
do such a thing?

671
01:45:54,689 --> 01:45:58,318
Let's burn everything.

672
01:45:58,369 --> 01:46:00,678
We're all giants.

673
01:46:11,689 --> 01:46:14,681
Now, we're all giants.

674
01:46:39,609 --> 01:46:43,284
What do you want to do?
It's only us!

675
01:46:44,129 --> 01:46:47,599
Let's go!

676
01:47:13,569 --> 01:47:16,879
- Who are you? - Fighters defending
the city of Naples.

677
01:47:16,929 --> 01:47:21,002
- Who is the moron that shot?
- Masullo, from Bagnoli. Come!

678
01:47:21,049 --> 01:47:24,280
- What do you want?
- Let me see you!

679
01:47:24,569 --> 01:47:28,164
- What are you doing with the Germans?
- The officer is our hostage.

680
01:47:28,209 --> 01:47:31,997
Who gave you the car?
Why are you still in uniform?

681
01:47:32,049 --> 01:47:36,247
- Do you know we could kill you?
- Let it be!

682
01:47:36,289 --> 01:47:39,281
You want to know where we're coming from?
From Vommero.

683
01:47:39,329 --> 01:47:42,241
With this officer we're trying to obtain
the surrender of the Germans...

684
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:44,564
...and the liberation of the
Naples hostages.

685
01:47:44,609 --> 01:47:49,080
<i>- How do we know you're telling the truth?
- I! And you... Go.</i>

686
01:47:49,129 --> 01:47:53,361
- You're responsible for every lost minute!
- I?

687
01:47:54,929 --> 01:47:59,161
You can go, but the German
hostage stays here!

688
01:48:05,849 --> 01:48:09,159
- I'll go with you.
- It's better like this

689
01:48:10,129 --> 01:48:14,281
The pistol!
Take it, Maria.

690
01:48:14,329 --> 01:48:21,360
Captain, if the Germans harm you,
we'll kill this one!

691
01:48:25,769 --> 01:48:30,126
Let's go! Hurry up!

692
01:48:36,369 --> 01:48:39,759
I can only deal with an official,
not with him.

693
01:48:39,809 --> 01:48:44,246
It's one of those bandits
that have fallen in our back.

694
01:48:44,289 --> 01:48:49,443
These bandits have owned their dignity
by fighting.

695
01:48:52,809 --> 01:48:56,165
That's why he's making the conditions.

696
01:48:59,089 --> 01:49:01,319
Come, your turn to speak.

697
01:49:01,849 --> 01:49:05,842
I?! And what should I say?

698
01:49:09,769 --> 01:49:14,081
Make him understand we don't like wars.

699
01:49:14,849 --> 01:49:19,001
It's enough they go away...
All in all, they must leave!

700
01:49:25,009 --> 01:49:29,287
Are you married, German?

701
01:49:29,329 --> 01:49:32,526
Do you love your wife?

702
01:49:33,169 --> 01:49:35,888
Do you love your wife?

703
01:49:38,209 --> 01:49:43,124
Yes, I've got a wife and children.

704
01:49:44,649 --> 01:49:46,924
Two.

705
01:49:47,969 --> 01:49:51,041
12 and 8 years.

706
01:49:52,929 --> 01:49:56,524
- What names!
- It's not their names, it's their age.

707
01:49:59,769 --> 01:50:03,842
I'd like to know if he thinks
about his wife.

708
01:50:09,769 --> 01:50:11,760
Did you understand?

709
01:50:13,969 --> 01:50:17,006
You miss your children.

710
01:50:22,169 --> 01:50:25,047
If you never missed them.

711
01:50:36,929 --> 01:50:39,966
<i>What was it?
Silence.</i>

712
01:50:40,089 --> 01:50:44,367
- Ours?
- No! - Yes-- No!

713
01:50:44,409 --> 01:50:47,526
- Tanks!
- The Germans!

714
01:50:51,009 --> 01:50:54,763
- The Germans are leaving!
- Look they've surrendered!

715
01:50:54,809 --> 01:51:01,999
Yes, the Germans are running!
We've made it!

716
01:51:02,129 --> 01:51:06,566
Look, ours are seeing them by,
they're taking them out of Naples!

717
01:51:06,609 --> 01:51:10,363
- Remember Naples!
- Don't come here again!

718
01:51:10,409 --> 01:51:14,163
Well done! Take them far away!

719
01:51:14,209 --> 01:51:17,042
<i>Go away!</i>

720
01:51:35,609 --> 01:51:38,362
Come, let's make them go.

721
01:51:40,929 --> 01:51:41,805
Go away!

722
01:51:43,889 --> 01:51:49,885
- We'll let them live this time!
Go! - Make way!

723
01:51:50,049 --> 01:51:55,806
- Take it, railway man.
- It's alright. Let's go, Maria.

724
01:52:11,529 --> 01:52:15,317
- CAPITANO! - Ma tu lo conosci!
Come si chiama?

725
01:52:15,369 --> 01:52:18,600
I think he never told us his name.

726
01:52:18,649 --> 01:52:22,358
I don't know, he was the Captain.

727
01:52:40,889 --> 01:52:44,359
Don't cry.

728
01:52:47,969 --> 01:52:52,565
<i>Carmine, come here.
I can't leave you for one moment.</i>

729
01:52:52,609 --> 01:52:56,363
- Here, ma'am.
- Honey! My baby!

730
01:52:56,409 --> 01:52:58,923
<i>Stay close to me, yes?</i>
