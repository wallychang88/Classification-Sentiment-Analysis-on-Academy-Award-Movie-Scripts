1
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,402
You mustn't listen
to what your younger brother says.

2
00:01:38,504 --> 00:01:41,598
I can't think of anyone less
an authority on female anatomy.

3
00:01:41,707 --> 00:01:43,607
He can see. It's enormous.

4
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:47,509
- No, it isn't.
- It's hideous.

5
00:01:47,613 --> 00:01:50,582
Why don't you show me that dress again?

6
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,589
It is a bit full here.
Let me have it.

7
00:01:58,992 --> 00:02:00,960
Thanks, Mom.

8
00:02:10,738 --> 00:02:12,706
Tsk.

9
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:47,677
- Taxi.!
- Taxi. Taxi.!

10
00:02:47,778 --> 00:02:49,439
- Is this your cab?
- It's not my cab.

11
00:02:49,546 --> 00:02:52,174
- Is this your cab?
- Really, it's not my cab.

12
00:02:52,282 --> 00:02:54,273
- We'll share it.
- But I don't want it.

13
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:57,752
No, we'll share it. I insist.
That way there'll be no ill feelings.

14
00:02:57,856 --> 00:02:59,756
- Are you going to Sally's too?
- No.

15
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:03,624
Well, that settles it. Come with us.
That way we'll all be going the same direction.

16
00:03:03,728 --> 00:03:06,196
You should come, otherwise
we're all gonna freeze out here.

17
00:03:06,297 --> 00:03:08,766
Come on.!

18
00:03:10,101 --> 00:03:12,502
- Hi. I'm Nick.
- Hi, Nick. I'm Tom.

19
00:03:12,605 --> 00:03:14,505
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Jane. This is Audrey.

20
00:03:14,607 --> 00:03:17,542
- Hi,Jane.
- You are going to Sally's, aren't you?

21
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,543
Of course there's a God.
We all basically know there is.

22
00:03:20,646 --> 00:03:23,046
- I know no such thing.
- Of course you do.

23
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:27,017
When you think to yourself-And most of our
waking life is taken up thinking to ourself-

24
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:30,283
you must have that feeling
that your thoughts aren't entirely wasted...

25
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,290
that, in some sense,
they are being heard.

26
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:35,385
Hey, I think it's this sensation
of silently being listened to...

27
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:37,396
with total comprehension...

28
00:03:37,498 --> 00:03:39,897
- Hi, Sally.
- You got here so fast.

29
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,697
- Hello!
- that represents our innate belief in a supreme being.

30
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:44,704
- Nice to meet you.
- We stole his cab.

31
00:03:44,806 --> 00:03:47,707
- What's his name again?
- Tom Townsend.

32
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:50,210
No, I think it was something else.

33
00:03:50,312 --> 00:03:52,803
No, it's Tom Townsend, I'm sure.

34
00:03:52,915 --> 00:03:54,815
He looks familiar.

35
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:58,648
He's the guy that was sitting at the table
behind ours without talking to anyone all evening.

36
00:03:58,754 --> 00:04:01,656
Then, outside, he got the cab
that we were trying to flag down.

37
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:04,658
But he insisted that we take it,
so Nick insisted that he come along too...

38
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,660
so that there should be no ill feeling.

39
00:04:06,762 --> 00:04:09,891
What it shows is that a kind of belief
is innate in all of us.

40
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,899
At some point
most of us lose that...

41
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,903
after which it can only be regained
by a conscious act of faith.

42
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,905
You've experienced that?

43
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,907
Uh, no, I haven't.

44
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,409
I- I hope to someday.

45
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:24,777
Actually, it wasn't my cab. I was just there
waiting for the light to change when it pulled up.

46
00:04:24,882 --> 00:04:27,373
- I never take cabs.
- You never take cabs?

47
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:29,885
No, I either walk
or take public transportation.

48
00:04:29,988 --> 00:04:31,888
- Why?
- A lot of reasons.

49
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,322
So you're one of those
public transportation snobs.

50
00:04:35,427 --> 00:04:38,885
- You look down on people who take taxis.
- No, not at all.

51
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:43,230
That's how New York's seen,
at least in the popular imagination.

52
00:04:43,336 --> 00:04:46,236
I don't think that there is
a popular imagination.

53
00:04:46,338 --> 00:04:48,239
- What do you mean?
- Just that.

54
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,310
I don't think that there is
a popular imagination.

55
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,310
- Pomfret. Where did you go?
- Farmington.

56
00:04:53,412 --> 00:04:55,312
Both of us did.

57
00:04:55,414 --> 00:04:57,314
Did you know Serena Slocum there?

58
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,316
- The inevitable question.
- What?

59
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:03,822
All the guys ask that. Serena had
an incredible number of boyfriends. At least 20.

60
00:05:03,924 --> 00:05:06,825
She could manage it because
they were all at different schools...

61
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:08,827
and she wrote letters
incredibly quickly.

62
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:12,127
Three in a single study hall.
She became really famous.

63
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:15,396
It's incredible how naive some guys are.
How do you know Serena?

64
00:05:15,503 --> 00:05:18,404
Actually, that might give someone
the wrong impression.

65
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:21,407
She wrote a lot of guys, but I'm sure
she liked some a lot more than others.

66
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:24,843
Oh, you think so? I never noticed that.
How do you know Serena?

67
00:05:25,947 --> 00:05:27,813
I was one of her boyfriends.

68
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:30,818
Oh.
You must be Pomfret.

69
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,820
- Your letters were really good.
- Yes.

70
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:35,015
- What do you mean?
- They were interesting.

71
00:05:35,124 --> 00:05:37,251
Serena let you read my letters?

72
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,918
No. She read them aloud.

73
00:05:40,263 --> 00:05:41,958
I can't believe it.

74
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:44,465
She only read us the ones
that she thought were really good.

75
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:46,467
Or really bad.
But yours were really good.

76
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:49,869
There was no suggestion of ridicule, if that's
what's worrying you. At least not that I can recall.

77
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,874
I remember a long letter you wrote Serena
about agrarian socialism.

78
00:05:52,976 --> 00:05:55,878
I think it was one of the first things
to set Alice Dreyer off about Marxism.

79
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,540
Since then she's joined
the Red Underground Army.

80
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:01,140
If she blows herself up,
it'll be your fault.

81
00:06:01,252 --> 00:06:04,153
It's actually surprising
to see you at something like this.

82
00:06:04,255 --> 00:06:06,986
In your letters, you expressed
a vehement opposition to deb parties...

83
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:08,992
and to conventional society
in general.

84
00:06:09,094 --> 00:06:10,994
- I take it you've changed your mind.
- No.

85
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:14,725
- I'm just as much opposed to them as ever.
- Then what made you decide to come tonight?

86
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,461
He got an invitation.

87
00:06:16,568 --> 00:06:21,232
He's right. I got an invitation and didn't
particularly have anything else to do.

88
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,969
I think that's the case
with almost everybody.

89
00:06:24,077 --> 00:06:26,511
No. Nick goes
whether he's invited or not.

90
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:31,073
Unlike Tom, I'm in favor of these kind of parties,
and I wanna show that support however I can.

91
00:06:31,185 --> 00:06:35,519
It's a bit ridiculous for someone to say
they're morally opposed to deb parties...

92
00:06:35,622 --> 00:06:37,522
and then attend them anyways.

93
00:06:37,624 --> 00:06:39,524
It's - It's untenable.

94
00:06:39,626 --> 00:06:41,992
- Everyone does.
- But that's no contradiction.

95
00:06:42,096 --> 00:06:43,996
I wasn't trying to.

96
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:47,227
I think it's justifiable to go once,
to know firsthand what it is you oppose.

97
00:06:47,335 --> 00:06:50,236
I'd read Veblen, but it was amazing to see
that these things still go on.

98
00:06:50,338 --> 00:06:53,570
- You're a Marxist?
- No, I'm a committed socialist, not a Marxist.

99
00:06:53,676 --> 00:06:57,840
I favor the socialist model developed by
the 19th-century French social critic Fourier.

100
00:06:57,947 --> 00:06:59,676
You're a Fourierist?

101
00:06:59,782 --> 00:07:01,750
Yes.

102
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:05,218
Fourierism was tried
in the 19th century and failed.

103
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:07,653
I mean, wasn't Brook Farm Fourierist?

104
00:07:07,757 --> 00:07:10,089
- It failed.
- That's debatable.

105
00:07:10,192 --> 00:07:13,219
- Whether Brook Farm failed?
- That it ceased to exist, I'll grant you.

106
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,322
But whether it was really a failure
I don't think can be definitively said.

107
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:19,994
Well -Well, for me,
ceasing to exist is failure.

108
00:07:20,104 --> 00:07:22,731
I mean, that's -
that's pretty definitive.

109
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:26,901
Well, everyone ceases to exist.
That doesn't mean everyone's a failure.

110
00:07:28,913 --> 00:07:31,143
- You really feel that way?
- I really do.

111
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:33,548
- Really?
- Really!

112
00:07:33,652 --> 00:07:35,552
Tom Townsend.

113
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:37,554
Tom Townsend.

114
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:39,556
It's a fine name.

115
00:07:39,658 --> 00:07:42,286
What about Tommy?
Tommy Townsend?

116
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:44,294
It's sounds more U.C.

117
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:46,296
Really? What's that?

118
00:07:46,398 --> 00:07:50,164
Well, we come here all the time,
thus the S.F.R.P. -

119
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,670
- Sally Fowler Rat Pack.
- Oh.

120
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:55,606
Mine and Charlie's are too.

121
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,608
But that's the ex -
exception though.

122
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,612
I mean, divorce is actually comparatively rare
among standard New York social types...

123
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,615
contrary to what people might think.

124
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,617
Well, usually there's
something wrong though.

125
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,619
Dead fathers are a common problem.

126
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,848
Jane's father's dead.
Very suddenly, last year.

127
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:12,187
- Must have been awful for her.
- Yes.

128
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:14,193
It was tough on him too.

129
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:17,197
That's different though.
That doesn't mean a broken home.

130
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:19,529
Well, it still means having your mother
go out on dates.

131
00:08:19,634 --> 00:08:23,035
My point was that the common image
of divorce and decadent behavior...

132
00:08:23,138 --> 00:08:25,538
being prevalent among
New York social types...

133
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,540
is not really accurate.

134
00:08:27,642 --> 00:08:29,633
That's more Southampton.

135
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:44,725
Okay, Cynthia, let's cha-cha-cha.

136
00:08:44,827 --> 00:08:46,727
It's completely ridiculous.

137
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:49,230
Oh, now, the cha-cha
is no more ridiculous than life itself.

138
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,824
- I don't know how to do it.
- You must have learned it in dancing school.

139
00:08:51,935 --> 00:08:54,028
- Cynthia was a dancing school dropout.
- I've got it.

140
00:08:54,138 --> 00:08:56,299
? Cha-cha-cha?

141
00:08:56,406 --> 00:08:58,237
Ah, the cha-cha.

142
00:08:58,342 --> 00:09:02,142
I don't think it's possible to forget the cha-cha.
I think you're blocking it out.

143
00:09:02,246 --> 00:09:06,047
♪ Cha-cha, cha-cha-cha
Cha-cha, cha-cha-cha ♪

152
00:09:28,507 --> 00:09:30,476
- Hi.
- Hi.

153
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:35,246
- What are you doing here in the dark?
- I was just getting a glass of water.

154
00:09:35,348 --> 00:09:37,316
Oh.

155
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:41,746
- It's gone awfully late.
- Yes.

156
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:43,756
What time do after-parties end?

157
00:09:43,858 --> 00:09:45,758
There's no set time.

158
00:09:45,861 --> 00:09:48,022
They usually end
whenever people go...

159
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,620
or whenever the parents get up.

160
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:53,131
Although the last time I was here,
over Thanksgiving...

161
00:09:53,234 --> 00:09:55,465
Sally's parents asked us
to stay for breakfast.

162
00:09:55,571 --> 00:09:57,471
That's amazing.

163
00:09:57,573 --> 00:10:00,474
- No one stayed except Nick.
- Really?

164
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:02,476
He likes everyone's parents.

165
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:05,480
I don't think I've ever met
anyone's parents, except Serena's.

166
00:10:05,582 --> 00:10:08,551
I once had quite a long talk
with her father.

167
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:13,378
What's the situation
between you and Serena now?

168
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:15,457
There is none.

169
00:10:16,694 --> 00:10:19,662
- When did you stop seeing each other?
- Yale game weekend.

170
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,438
Dawn in the big city.

171
00:10:30,075 --> 00:10:32,542
There are eight million stories
out there.

172
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,191
- Give our apologies to them.
- Oh, it's not necessary.

173
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:49,193
No, I think it is.
Good night.

174
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:51,195
- Good night.
- Good night, darling.

175
00:10:51,297 --> 00:10:53,197
- Good night.
- Thank you.

176
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:55,199
- Oh, you're welcome.
- Thanks a lot.

177
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:57,201
- You're welcome. We'll see you tonight?
- No.

178
00:10:57,303 --> 00:11:00,171
- You should come. Hope's a friend of ours.
- You won't be coming to any more dances?

179
00:11:00,274 --> 00:11:02,504
- No.
- Oh, well, that's a shame.

180
00:11:02,609 --> 00:11:05,169
- It was nice meeting you.
- Thank you. It was nice to meet you.

181
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,680
- Ciao, Sally. Ciao!
- Ciao!

182
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:10,409
- Good luck with your Fourierism.
- Thank you.

183
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:17,356
Unless we get a Checker,
we're gonna have to take two cabs.

184
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,359
- Don't worry about me. I'm gonna walk.
- Really? But it's terribly cold.

185
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:22,862
- I prefer to walk.
- You'll freeze dressed like that.

186
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:25,933
This is actually very warm.
It has a lining.

187
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:37,408
- Good-bye. Ciao, Tom.
- Bye-bye, Tom.

188
00:11:37,514 --> 00:11:39,482
- Good night.
- Bye.

189
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:46,921
Where are we headed?

190
00:11:47,024 --> 00:11:50,083
He's gonna freeze dressed like that
in weather like this.

191
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:52,856
Driver, follow that pedestrian.

192
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,434
- Hey, fella!
- We have a Checker. Can we give you a lift?

193
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,532
- No, thanks.
- You sure?

194
00:12:04,643 --> 00:12:06,611
Yep. Thanks anyway.

195
00:12:16,688 --> 00:12:19,590
He's getting a crosstown bus.

196
00:12:19,692 --> 00:12:21,660
That explains it.

197
00:12:22,794 --> 00:12:24,763
A Westsider is amongst us.

198
00:13:17,788 --> 00:13:19,688
There is a real escort shortage.

199
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,656
It's no joke.

200
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,253
- What was your impression of him?
- He seemed nice. I didn't talk to him much.

201
00:13:26,364 --> 00:13:29,265
Mom, I don't want to seem rude.
I know I got up very late.

202
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:31,267
But I'm having what,
for me, is breakfast...

203
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:34,270
and I really don't want to think about
returning my tuxedo right now.

204
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:37,274
- It's just that I think it's getting too late -
- Mom, get off my back!

205
00:13:37,376 --> 00:13:39,844
It's nearly 6:00.
They're going to close.

206
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,572
Jesus!

207
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:47,752
If I have to pay for another day-

208
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,111
Was it already closed?

209
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:19,585
How much extra will it cost?

210
00:14:19,687 --> 00:14:22,350
Twenty-five dollars.

211
00:14:22,457 --> 00:14:25,358
- I'm sorry about what I said earlier.
- Not at all.

212
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,089
A girl called.
Her number's by the kitchen phone.

213
00:14:28,197 --> 00:14:30,427
She said it was a bit urgent.

214
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:33,433
I know it's very late,
but we had trouble getting your number.

215
00:14:33,535 --> 00:14:37,199
Basically, we'd all be going together,
although officially you'd be Audrey's escort.

216
00:14:37,306 --> 00:14:39,241
- Who?
- Audrey Rouget.

217
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:41,675
The party should be
of some sociological interest.

218
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:44,644
Peter Duchin,
the Plaza ballroom, et cetera.

219
00:14:44,747 --> 00:14:47,581
- You think you'll be able to come?
- Um -

220
00:14:47,684 --> 00:14:50,812
Well, actually, there's a bit
of an escort shortage.

221
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,477
Hi, Rick.

222
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:27,652
What a mystery. Rick Von Sloneker
and Serena Slocum, still together.

223
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,252
- Seems like months.
- It has been months.

224
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,763
Well, one thing's for certain -
she's lost her virginity by now.

225
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:36,962
- How can you say that?
- You're right. Maybe she wasn't a virgin.

226
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:46,812
- Riffraff.
- He's hardly that.

227
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:50,078
Oh, you mean because of his title.
We're supposed to be impressed by that.

228
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:53,916
On the contrary, I think the titled
aristocracy are the scum of the Earth.

229
00:15:56,858 --> 00:15:59,349
By Tolstoy, War and Peace...

230
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:02,556
and by Jane Austen,
Persuasion and Mansfield Park.

231
00:16:02,665 --> 00:16:05,293
Mansfield Park?
You've got to be kidding.

232
00:16:05,401 --> 00:16:08,096
- No.
- But it's a notoriously bad book.

233
00:16:08,204 --> 00:16:10,604
Even Lionel Trilling,
one of her greatest admirers, thought that.

234
00:16:10,707 --> 00:16:13,301
Well, if Lionel Trilling thought that,
he's an idiot.

235
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:16,607
The whole story
revolves around, what...

236
00:16:16,713 --> 00:16:19,113
the immorality of a group of young people
putting on a play.

237
00:16:19,215 --> 00:16:22,151
In the context of the novel
it makes perfect sense.

238
00:16:22,252 --> 00:16:25,153
But the context of the novel,
and nearly everything Jane Austen wrote...

239
00:16:25,256 --> 00:16:27,156
is near ridiculous
from today's perspective.

240
00:16:27,258 --> 00:16:30,249
Has it ever occurred to you that today,
looked at from Jane Austen's perspective...

241
00:16:30,361 --> 00:16:32,329
would look even worse?

242
00:16:39,371 --> 00:16:41,271
You must be freezing
dressed in that.

243
00:16:41,373 --> 00:16:44,673
- It has a lining.
- What kind of lining is it?

244
00:16:44,777 --> 00:16:46,677
You gonna wear a raincoat all winter?

245
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:49,543
Princeton's south of here.
I guess it's a lot warmer.

246
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:52,550
No, I just didn't know
where to get a good overcoat.

247
00:16:52,652 --> 00:16:55,052
Uh, Brooks,J. Press, Tripler-

248
00:16:55,154 --> 00:16:57,555
Actually, I haven't had time to buy one.

249
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,916
I'm not sure I wanna go back to Princeton
next year. It's too much of a country club for me.

250
00:17:23,017 --> 00:17:24,918
You really shouldn't
treat Serena that way.

251
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:27,579
- What?
- Giving her the silent treatment.

252
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,591
- I'm not giving her the silent treatment.
- Come on.

253
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:33,595
I'm not giving her the silent treatment.
I just don't have anything to say to her.

254
00:17:33,697 --> 00:17:36,597
Listen, I know you're angry with her.
You're probably right to be.

255
00:17:36,699 --> 00:17:40,101
But it's still not right to treat her that way.
I think Serena really feels hurt by it.

256
00:17:40,203 --> 00:17:42,103
Oh, give me a break!

257
00:17:42,205 --> 00:17:44,435
Serena Slocum, a real feeling?

258
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,442
Serena's basically a good person.

259
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:51,072
- She has feelings like anybody else.
- I find that very hard to believe.

260
00:17:51,182 --> 00:17:53,616
All this is - is pretty deceptive.

261
00:17:53,717 --> 00:17:56,619
- All what?
- Well, I -

262
00:17:56,721 --> 00:18:00,452
I think that - that -
that we are all, in a sense, doomed.

263
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:02,424
What are you talking about?

264
00:18:02,526 --> 00:18:04,427
Downward social mobility.

265
00:18:04,529 --> 00:18:07,429
We hear a lot about
the great social mobility in America...

266
00:18:07,532 --> 00:18:11,195
with the focus usually on
the comparative ease of moving upwards.

267
00:18:11,304 --> 00:18:15,172
What's less discussed is
how easy it is to - to go down.

268
00:18:15,274 --> 00:18:18,174
I think that's the -
the direction that we're all heading in.

269
00:18:18,276 --> 00:18:21,178
And I think that the downward fall
is gonna be very fast.

270
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,774
Not just for us as individuals,
but the whole preppy class.

271
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:28,286
Where do you get all this?

272
00:18:28,388 --> 00:18:32,484
Well,just look around. Take those
of our fathers who grew up very well off.

273
00:18:32,593 --> 00:18:35,187
Maybe their careers
started out well enough...

274
00:18:35,295 --> 00:18:38,423
but just as their contemporaries
really began to accomplish things...

275
00:18:38,532 --> 00:18:40,500
they started to quit...

276
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:42,501
on rising above office politics...

277
00:18:42,603 --> 00:18:45,505
or- or refusing to compete
and risk open failure.

278
00:18:45,607 --> 00:18:48,167
Or not - not doing
the humdrum part of the job.

279
00:18:48,276 --> 00:18:50,176
Or only doing the humdrum part.

280
00:18:50,278 --> 00:18:54,408
Or gradually spending more and more time
on something more interesting -

281
00:18:54,516 --> 00:18:56,416
um, conservation, or the arts...

282
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:58,851
where even if they were total failures
no one would know it.

283
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:01,013
Okay.

284
00:19:01,123 --> 00:19:04,024
I guess we all know
who you're talking about.

285
00:19:04,126 --> 00:19:06,094
I can't deny your point, but...

286
00:19:06,196 --> 00:19:09,824
unlike you, I've always
assumed I'd be a failure anyway.

287
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:12,959
That's why I plan to marry
an extremely rich woman.

288
00:19:14,004 --> 00:19:15,904
Pretty depressing.

289
00:19:16,006 --> 00:19:18,566
A bit overstated, don't you think?

290
00:19:18,675 --> 00:19:21,577
- I'm not so sure.
- "Doomed. "

291
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,579
Even if he were right...

292
00:19:23,681 --> 00:19:26,843
it wouldn't be any great tragedy if some
of these people lost their class prerogatives.

293
00:19:26,951 --> 00:19:29,351
"These people" are everyone I know.

294
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:34,413
And besides, it's not a question of losing
class prerogatives, whatever that means...

295
00:19:34,526 --> 00:19:37,426
but the prospect of wasting
your whole productive life...

296
00:19:37,528 --> 00:19:39,429
of personal failure.

297
00:19:39,531 --> 00:19:41,431
That's so melodramatic.

298
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:44,434
Life is melodramatic,
if you look at the whole sweep of it.

299
00:19:44,536 --> 00:19:46,936
I don't know.

300
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,941
I think my father
considers himself a failure...

301
00:19:50,043 --> 00:19:52,011
although I don't think he's one.

302
00:19:53,312 --> 00:19:55,611
I guess few people's lives...

303
00:19:55,715 --> 00:19:57,683
match their own expectations.

304
00:20:03,624 --> 00:20:06,524
I always drink two glasses of water
before going to bed anyway.

305
00:20:06,626 --> 00:20:08,595
It's great for your complexion.

306
00:20:08,762 --> 00:20:13,597
I thought I should mention I'm putting you
on the floor committee for the Christmas ball.

307
00:20:13,701 --> 00:20:17,296
Essentially, all it means is, you'll be able to go
on your own rather than as someone's escort...

308
00:20:17,404 --> 00:20:20,306
and that you'll get
a white carnation for your lapel.

309
00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:23,309
Thanks a lot, but actually I'm not
planning to go to any more dances.

310
00:20:23,411 --> 00:20:25,311
You weren't?

311
00:20:25,413 --> 00:20:27,814
Well, I strongly advise you
to change your mind.

312
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:30,215
Is it that your resources
are limited?

313
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:33,584
This is about the only economical
social life you're gonna find in New York.

314
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:37,591
Music, drinks, entertainment,
hot, nutritious meals...

315
00:20:37,693 --> 00:20:39,888
all at no expense to you.

316
00:20:39,996 --> 00:20:42,898
Basically, all you need
is one suit of evening clothes...

317
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,900
and a tailcoat.

318
00:20:45,002 --> 00:20:48,904
Dances are either white tie or black tie,
so you only need two ties.

319
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,341
- You rented that from where?
- A.T. Harris.

320
00:20:52,442 --> 00:20:54,672
Oh, good!
You know about Harris.

321
00:20:54,778 --> 00:20:57,144
They also sell them secondhand,
very inexpensively.

322
00:20:57,247 --> 00:20:59,147
- It's a good arrangement.
- Thanks a lot.

323
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:01,810
My resources are limited,
but actually that's not it.

324
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,413
I know. You're opposed
to these parties on principle.

325
00:21:05,524 --> 00:21:07,923
- Yes.
- Exactly what principle is that?

326
00:21:08,026 --> 00:21:09,927
Well -

327
00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:12,929
The principle that one shouldn't be out
at night eating hors d'oeuvres...

328
00:21:13,032 --> 00:21:15,933
when one could be home
worrying about the less fortunate.

329
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:17,935
Pretty much, yes.

330
00:21:18,037 --> 00:21:22,030
Has it ever occurred to you
that you are the less fortunate?

331
00:21:23,076 --> 00:21:26,135
I mean, there's something
a tiny bit arrogant...

332
00:21:26,246 --> 00:21:30,979
about people going around feeling sorry
for other people they consider less fortunate.

333
00:21:31,084 --> 00:21:33,781
Are the more fortunate
really so terrific?

334
00:21:33,888 --> 00:21:36,448
Do you want some much-richer guy
going around saying...

335
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:41,050
"Poor Tom Townsend doesn't even have
a winter jacket - I can't go to any more parties"?

336
00:21:41,161 --> 00:21:43,062
That's a bit cynical.

337
00:21:43,163 --> 00:21:46,065
This is not just a matter
of what you personally prefer.

338
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:49,365
I'll tell you this in confidence.
You've made a big impression on these girls -

339
00:21:49,471 --> 00:21:51,371
- Oh, come on.!
- No, I'm serious.

340
00:21:51,473 --> 00:21:55,876
They like you and are now
counting on you as an escort.

341
00:21:55,978 --> 00:21:58,344
Well, I like them, too,
but that doesn't -

342
00:21:58,448 --> 00:22:02,350
I'm not sure if you realize this, but these girls
are at a very vulnerable point in their lives.

343
00:22:02,452 --> 00:22:07,445
All of this is much more emotional
and difficult for them than it is for us.

344
00:22:07,556 --> 00:22:09,457
They're on display.

345
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:12,824
They have to call the guys up
and invite them as escorts.

346
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:15,831
And preppy girls mature socially
much later than others do.

347
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:18,833
For many of them, this is the first
serious social life they've had...

348
00:22:18,935 --> 00:22:23,066
and if you just disappear now,
they're gonna take that as personal rejection.

349
00:22:23,173 --> 00:22:26,336
- Give me a break.
- I'm not entirely joking.

350
00:22:26,443 --> 00:22:28,502
You should go.

351
00:22:28,612 --> 00:22:32,104
If Thorstein Veblen were here,
he'd tell you the same thing.

352
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,921
I'll meet you at 4:30 at Brooks,
main floor, southwest corner...

353
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,548
where the pajamas intersect
with the expensive shirts...

354
00:22:40,658 --> 00:22:42,627
right across from
the undershorts counter.

355
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:47,129
As a romance,
it never really existed.

356
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:49,724
- Really?
- I made a classic mistake.

357
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,303
I fell in love with Serena
long before I met her.

358
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:55,739
I'd seen her at a Chapin dance,
but I didn't really meet her until a year later.

359
00:22:55,842 --> 00:23:00,744
Even before we started going out,
I'd built up this huge romantic vision about her.

360
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:02,747
It should be just the reverse.

361
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:05,249
You should get to know someone
gradually, over time...

362
00:23:05,352 --> 00:23:07,752
before the possibility of falling in love
even occurs to you.

363
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,754
Possibly not even then.

364
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:12,017
So the experience
has somewhat hardened you?

365
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:16,825
Yes. At least, it's a very bad idea to fall
for someone who doesn't for you.

366
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:22,535
Yes, but you can't know that you'll feel
exactly the same way all the time.

367
00:23:22,637 --> 00:23:25,539
I mean, I suppose
there will be risk in any romance.

368
00:23:25,641 --> 00:23:27,541
I suppose so.

369
00:23:27,643 --> 00:23:30,111
Well, this is my building.

370
00:23:31,147 --> 00:23:33,512
- Thanks very much for coming.
- Thank you.

371
00:23:35,485 --> 00:23:38,180
You'll come again tomorrow?
It'll be as a group.

372
00:23:38,287 --> 00:23:40,255
Yes.

373
00:24:13,525 --> 00:24:15,925
Thanks, Mom.
I know how tight things have been.

374
00:24:16,027 --> 00:24:18,690
Things haven't been that tight.
- I'll pay you back next month.

375
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:20,698
Or in February.

376
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,701
- Has Dad called?
- He's never called here. You know that.

377
00:24:23,803 --> 00:24:26,397
- I thought maybe his office had.
- No.

378
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,475
Thanks a lot.

379
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,942
- They're normally this long in the back?
- Yes, sir.

380
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:38,347
- Uh-huh.
- Like to try on the tuxedo?

381
00:24:38,452 --> 00:24:40,420
Okay.

382
00:24:41,656 --> 00:24:43,556
Here you go.

383
00:24:46,426 --> 00:24:48,327
I think I'd prefer one
more like the one I rented.

384
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:51,193
That is the one you rented.
- Oh.

385
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:54,291
I didn't realize it looked like this.
I guess it'll be all right.

386
00:24:54,402 --> 00:24:56,371
Thank you.

387
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:02,844
You haven't seen this?
Detachable collar.

388
00:25:02,945 --> 00:25:06,403
Not many people wear them anymore.
They look much better.

389
00:25:06,515 --> 00:25:10,418
So many things which were better in the past
have been abandoned for supposed convenience.

390
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:15,115
- I had no idea anyone wore those anymore.
- It's a small thing, but symbolically important.

391
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:18,126
Our parents' generation was never
interested in keeping up standards.

392
00:25:18,228 --> 00:25:23,132
They wanted to be happy, but the last way
to be happy is to make it your objective in life.

393
00:25:23,234 --> 00:25:25,464
I wonder if our generation's
any better than our parents'.

394
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:30,473
Oh, it's far worse. Our generation's probably
the worst since the Protestant Reformation.

395
00:25:30,575 --> 00:25:35,478
It's barbaric, but a barbarism even worse
than the old-fashioned, straightforward kind.

396
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:40,280
Now barbarism is cloaked with all sorts
of self-righteousness and moral superiority.

397
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:44,185
- Will you look at this?
- You're obviously talking about a lot more than just detachable collars.

398
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:45,655
Yeah, I am.

399
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:01,298
Because he's obviously
not an interesting guy.

400
00:26:01,407 --> 00:26:03,807
Why is he so successful
with girls then?

401
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:07,608
Rick Von Sloneker is tall,
rich, good-looking...

402
00:26:07,715 --> 00:26:09,945
stupid, dishonest, conceited...

403
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,951
a bully, liar, drunk and thief...

404
00:26:13,053 --> 00:26:15,283
an egomaniac
and probably psychotic.

405
00:26:15,389 --> 00:26:17,687
In short,
highly attractive to women.

406
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:20,920
You're completely unfair.
You don't know anything about Rick.

407
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:23,589
- In fact, he's quite shy.
- God!

408
00:26:23,698 --> 00:26:25,598
He's a considerate and sensitive man.

409
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,669
The rest is just
a superficial game he plays, a façade...

410
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,670
which you've obviously
been taken in by.

411
00:26:30,772 --> 00:26:34,140
It's incredible, the eagerness of girls like you
to justify the worst bastards imaginable...

412
00:26:34,243 --> 00:26:36,370
as being sensitive and shy.

413
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:39,380
But if any guy who really was shy
dared talk to you...

414
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:42,384
you wouldn't give him the time of day-
your eyes would glaze over.

415
00:26:42,486 --> 00:26:45,386
You're really hung up on Rick, aren't you?
He must really threaten you somehow.

416
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:47,389
You're right.
I do feel threatened...

417
00:26:47,491 --> 00:26:51,154
that I may get a venereal disease
from one of the St. Tim's girls he's been with.

418
00:26:52,763 --> 00:26:55,824
Did you learn that
from your lovemaking with Rick?

419
00:26:55,933 --> 00:26:57,901
I hear it can get really rough.

420
00:26:58,002 --> 00:27:00,970
- Hey!
- Don't do that again.

421
00:27:02,273 --> 00:27:04,366
For me, it isn't erotic.

422
00:27:06,644 --> 00:27:10,011
- What are you looking at?
- My father's apartment.

423
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,050
- Where?
- The fourth floor.

424
00:27:13,152 --> 00:27:16,087
- Corner apartment.
- That's Kate Preston's building.

425
00:27:16,188 --> 00:27:18,952
Have your parents been divorced long?

426
00:27:19,058 --> 00:27:20,958
The actual divorce
was three years ago...

427
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,961
but they were separated
for a year before that.

428
00:27:24,064 --> 00:27:27,362
- Do you see your father much?
- We have lunch when I'm in town.

429
00:27:27,466 --> 00:27:30,595
- That's very little.
- No, actually we have a very good relationship.

430
00:27:30,704 --> 00:27:33,606
Probably much better than most people
who see their father all the time.

431
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:36,870
It's just that my stepmother is a writer
and having us around makes her nervous.

432
00:27:38,712 --> 00:27:41,580
I read that Lionel Trilling essay
you mentioned.

433
00:27:41,682 --> 00:27:43,843
- You really like Trilling?
- Yes.

434
00:27:44,886 --> 00:27:47,047
I think he's very strange.

435
00:27:47,155 --> 00:27:50,784
He says that nobody could like
the heroine of Mansfield Park.

436
00:27:50,892 --> 00:27:52,792
I like her.

437
00:27:52,894 --> 00:27:56,887
Then he goes on and on about how we modern
people of today with our modern attitudes...

438
00:27:56,998 --> 00:28:01,264
bitterly resent Mansfield Park
because its heroine is virtuous?

439
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:04,272
What's wrong with a novel
having a virtuous heroine?

440
00:28:04,374 --> 00:28:06,274
His point is that the novel's premise -

441
00:28:06,376 --> 00:28:09,777
that there's something immoral in a group of
young people putting on a play- is simply absurd.

442
00:28:09,879 --> 00:28:11,904
You found Fanny Price unlikable?

443
00:28:12,014 --> 00:28:14,448
She sounds pretty unbearable.
But I haven't read the book.

444
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,782
- What?
- You don't have to have read a book to have an opinion on it.

445
00:28:17,888 --> 00:28:19,788
I haven't read the Bible either.

446
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,757
What Jane Austen novels have you read?

447
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,760
None. I don't read novels.

448
00:28:24,862 --> 00:28:26,763
I prefer good literary criticism.

449
00:28:26,865 --> 00:28:29,765
That way, you get both the novelist's ideas
as well as the critic's thinking.

450
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:32,769
With fiction, I can never forget
that none of it ever really happened...

451
00:28:32,871 --> 00:28:34,839
that it's all just made up
by the author.

452
00:28:38,243 --> 00:28:41,736
One thing I like about him is
he doesn't say all the expected things.

453
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:44,747
He doesn't just agree with everything
everyone else is saying.

454
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:48,411
That's true. He disagrees
with everything everyone else says.

455
00:28:48,521 --> 00:28:50,421
I'm not sure I prefer that.

456
00:28:50,523 --> 00:28:53,720
He's quite good-looking though.
I think serious guys tend to be better-looking.

457
00:28:53,826 --> 00:28:55,953
Ow!

458
00:29:08,142 --> 00:29:12,704
The term "bourgeois" has almost always
been - been one of contempt.

459
00:29:12,814 --> 00:29:17,717
Yet it is precisely the - the bourgeoisie
which is responsible for-

460
00:29:17,819 --> 00:29:22,279
well, for nearly everything good that has happened
in our civilization over the past four centuries.

461
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:26,020
You know the French film,
The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie?

462
00:29:26,128 --> 00:29:28,528
When I first heard that title I thought...

463
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:31,622
"Finally, someone's gonna tell the truth
about the bourgeoisie. "

464
00:29:31,733 --> 00:29:34,065
What a disappointment.

465
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:37,661
It would be hard to imagine
a less fair or accurate portrait.

466
00:29:37,773 --> 00:29:39,674
Well, of course.
Buñuel's a surrealist.

467
00:29:39,775 --> 00:29:42,870
- Despising the bourgeoisie is part of their credo.
- Where do they get off?.

468
00:29:42,979 --> 00:29:46,881
But the truth is,
the bourgeoisie does have a lot of charm.

469
00:29:46,983 --> 00:29:48,883
Of course it does.

470
00:29:48,985 --> 00:29:51,579
The surrealists
were just a lot of social climbers.

471
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:53,383
Is there any more wine?

472
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,325
I like the French.

473
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:59,157
- Really?
- At least those I met in Grenoble.

474
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:02,790
Actually, the only girl I ever knew who studied
in France stayed over there and got married.

475
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,800
So I guess she liked the French too.

476
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,531
I'm not sure I like them that much.

477
00:30:19,352 --> 00:30:22,253
S.P.S., we used to call him.

478
00:30:22,355 --> 00:30:25,256
Never mind.

479
00:30:25,358 --> 00:30:27,326
Look.

480
00:30:59,227 --> 00:31:02,755
- I think I'll visit the powder room.
- What really goes on in there?

481
00:31:02,865 --> 00:31:04,833
Oh, it's fabulous.

482
00:31:12,242 --> 00:31:15,143
You seem to be in an awfully
good mood tonight, Townsend.

483
00:31:15,245 --> 00:31:18,146
- Of course, you're in your element here.
- Are you kidding?

484
00:31:18,248 --> 00:31:21,274
You're part of it all -
the whole Manhattan thing.

485
00:31:21,384 --> 00:31:23,285
It's different for those of us
from the country.

486
00:31:23,386 --> 00:31:26,288
- You're from Greenwich.
- North Greenwich.

487
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,950
- This is your world, not mine.
- Oh, come on.

488
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:33,121
You're part of that whole Sally Fowler crowd.
Doesn't get much more inside than that.

489
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:36,200
Not that I particularly care.
I don't believe in those things.

490
00:31:37,602 --> 00:31:41,505
- Oh, hi, Serena.
- Hi. Hi, Tom.

491
00:31:41,607 --> 00:31:43,837
- How's your brother?
- Fine.

492
00:31:44,943 --> 00:31:48,242
Tom, I think we should talk.

493
00:31:49,948 --> 00:31:53,646
I haven't been giving you the silent treatment.
I just haven't been talking to you.

494
00:31:53,753 --> 00:31:55,721
Well, I felt it.

495
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,523
I love the St. Regis.

496
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,528
There's all sorts of
hidden nooks and crannies.

497
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,530
It's really charming.

498
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:07,100
Yes. They'll probably
knock it down soon.

499
00:32:15,109 --> 00:32:18,011
It hardly explains why you just left me there
waiting for you to call...

500
00:32:18,113 --> 00:32:22,015
without even a phone call
to explain why you didn't show up.

501
00:32:22,117 --> 00:32:26,144
I'm sorry it was such a bad time for you, but I don't
see how that should make me feel any better.

502
00:32:26,254 --> 00:32:30,384
You don't? Well, it always
makes me feel better.

503
00:32:30,492 --> 00:32:34,223
Well, it makes me feel somewhat better,
but it still doesn't change anything.

504
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:36,730
It shows that it wasn't intentional.

505
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:39,027
To me,
that's an important distinction.

506
00:32:51,114 --> 00:32:53,413
Things are definitely over with Rick.

507
00:32:54,785 --> 00:32:57,687
With some relationships,
the breaking up is easier to understand...

508
00:32:57,789 --> 00:33:00,757
than how you got involved
in the first place.

509
00:33:03,695 --> 00:33:06,095
Do you think I'd have
any trouble getting a cab?

510
00:33:06,197 --> 00:33:08,928
- You're going already?
- Yes. I'm exhausted.

511
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:12,800
My mother's doctor's been giving me these
vitamin shots. They've worn off or something.

512
00:33:20,846 --> 00:33:23,748
Oh, Fred, something's come up
and I've got to go out for a while.

513
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:26,943
Would you tell Audrey I should be back soon,
but if there's any problem I'll meet her at Sally's?

514
00:33:27,052 --> 00:33:29,954
Should I not get back,
could you see that she gets there okay?

515
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:39,628
Thought I was gonna puke.

516
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,339
I had hardly anything to drink.

517
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:50,400
It must have been something I ate -
those Vienna sausages.

518
00:34:05,428 --> 00:34:08,329
Actually, I was surprised to see you
at the dances this week.

519
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:11,264
You used to be so opposed
to that sort of thing.

520
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:13,267
I still am, basically.

521
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:15,929
I went to the first one almost accidentally
and that night just happened to fall in...

522
00:34:16,038 --> 00:34:17,938
with an extraordinarily nice
group of people.

523
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,940
Otherwise I wouldn't have
gone to any more.

524
00:34:20,042 --> 00:34:23,672
I'd hardly call Nick Smith nice.
He's a terrible snob.

525
00:34:23,781 --> 00:34:26,444
He's basically a nice guy, I think.

526
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,711
His behavior toward Rick
has been vicious.

527
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:31,310
What did he do?

528
00:34:31,421 --> 00:34:35,222
Tried to make a big stink about some girl.
Rick didn't want to talk about it.

529
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:37,294
Apparently it was awful.

530
00:34:38,897 --> 00:34:41,058
Rick thinks Nick
could be really crazy.

531
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:43,863
I'm just worried
that something's happened to him.

532
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:46,869
I don't see how - how anything
could happen to him in a hotel.

533
00:34:46,972 --> 00:34:49,372
Maybe it was the same thing
that happened to Fred.

534
00:34:49,475 --> 00:34:51,875
Tom hasn't had much experience
in places like these.

535
00:34:51,977 --> 00:34:55,879
Maybe he went through one of those fire doors that
lock from the inside and shut himself in the stairwell.

536
00:34:55,981 --> 00:34:59,383
The fire stairs here aren't like that. I've had to use them
when people have forgotten to invite me to their parties.

537
00:34:59,486 --> 00:35:01,716
I've never had any trouble.

538
00:35:01,821 --> 00:35:04,222
I just don't understand
where he could be.

539
00:35:08,662 --> 00:35:10,324
Well, that - that's interesting...

540
00:35:10,431 --> 00:35:13,331
because actually there's very little
social snobbery in the United States.

541
00:35:13,434 --> 00:35:15,334
I mean, it's considered unacceptable.

542
00:35:15,436 --> 00:35:17,734
There's almost
a national taboo against it.

543
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,740
- It's looked down upon.
- That's good, isn't it?

544
00:35:20,842 --> 00:35:23,744
No, I'm not talking about
what's good or bad.

545
00:35:23,845 --> 00:35:26,245
I'm just making
a- a-an observation of fact.

546
00:35:26,347 --> 00:35:28,248
Well, I think it is good.

547
00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:31,478
I can't stand snobbery
or snobbish attitudes of any kind.

548
00:35:32,522 --> 00:35:34,649
Could you see who's there?

549
00:35:40,897 --> 00:35:43,798
- Sorry to be so late.
- Where were you?

550
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,266
- Didn't Fred tell you?
- Tell us what?

551
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:49,270
The only thing we heard from Fred was -

552
00:35:49,372 --> 00:35:52,274
- Fred left ages ago.
- God, Audrey, I'm sorry.

553
00:35:52,376 --> 00:35:55,277
- Why?
- I asked Fred to tell you if I didn't get back-

554
00:35:55,379 --> 00:35:57,347
Don't worry.
It's nothing.

555
00:35:59,084 --> 00:36:01,984
- Well, where were you?
- I had to take Serena home.

556
00:36:02,086 --> 00:36:05,056
She was feeling badly
and she was going to go home alone.

557
00:36:11,763 --> 00:36:15,221
She's broken up with Rick.
It just took longer than I expected.

558
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:18,235
I asked Fred to tell you that if I didn't
make it back, I'd meet you here.

559
00:36:18,337 --> 00:36:21,738
- We didn't get that message.
- We thought you'd gotten trapped somewhere in the hotel.

560
00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:24,401
- Audrey was very concerned.
- I'm very sorry.

561
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,478
You sound very sorry.

562
00:36:29,249 --> 00:36:32,116
I find it very hard to believe
that Serena broke up with Rick.

563
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:34,187
It was probably the other way around.

564
00:36:38,959 --> 00:36:42,623
I'm worried about Audrey.
She seems to have taken this so hard.

565
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,630
I'm a bit surprised.

566
00:36:44,732 --> 00:36:47,565
I had no idea
Fred was gonna get sick.

567
00:36:47,669 --> 00:36:49,830
You know, where -
where do you get off?

568
00:36:49,937 --> 00:36:51,838
I mean, you're surprised?

569
00:36:51,941 --> 00:36:56,344
You were Audrey's escort, yet you blithely
left her stranded in the middle of the dance.

570
00:36:56,445 --> 00:36:58,844
And then you try to
shirk the whole thing off on Fred.

571
00:36:58,947 --> 00:37:01,849
I was not trying to shirk
the whole thing off on Fred.

572
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:04,852
And I wasn't even Audrey's escort.
We were all there as a group.

573
00:37:04,954 --> 00:37:07,616
- In any case, I'm very sorry there was a mix-up.
- There was no mix-up.

574
00:37:07,723 --> 00:37:09,123
Well, it wasn't intentional.

575
00:37:09,225 --> 00:37:13,059
When you're an egoist,
none of the harm you do is intentional.

576
00:37:15,465 --> 00:37:17,365
You're going already?

577
00:37:17,467 --> 00:37:19,867
- Yes. I'm really tired.
- Just a second. I'll get my coat.

578
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,870
No, that's okay.
Charlie said he'd take me.

579
00:37:21,972 --> 00:37:23,872
- I'd like to.
- No, really.

580
00:37:23,974 --> 00:37:25,874
Don't bother.

581
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,377
Listen, I'm really sorry
about what happened tonight.

582
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:31,380
- I thought I'd be back much more quickly.
- It's not important.

583
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:33,382
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, good night.

584
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:35,976
- You ready?
- Good night.

585
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,989
- Good night, Audrey.
- Feel better.

586
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:43,426
I never thought of myself
as a bastard, an egoist.

587
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:45,428
Listen, don't flatter yourself.

588
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:48,431
Charlie's standard of polite behavior
is so exaggerated.

589
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:51,435
At school he used to
individually answer all his junk mail.

590
00:37:51,537 --> 00:37:55,098
I suppose he thought someone's feelings
would be hurt if he didn't.

591
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:59,508
I like him a lot, but don't try to
understand his thought processes.

592
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:01,512
The summer I met him -
We were 10-

593
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:05,676
he was trying to establish communications
with the seagulls of Easthampton.

594
00:38:05,786 --> 00:38:08,687
It was utterly hopeless.
The Easthampton seagulls are complete morons.

595
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:11,690
We still spent several afternoons
approaching shore birds, saying...

596
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:13,693
"We come in friendship. "

597
00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:17,697
They could not have cared less - much like
his efforts with girls in recent years.

598
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:20,426
Great. I'm hated
by the preppy St. Francis.

599
00:38:20,534 --> 00:38:22,435
I wouldn't worry about it.

600
00:38:22,537 --> 00:38:24,937
That's the building
where my father lives.

601
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,668
- Do you know Kate Preston? She lives there.
- No.

602
00:38:29,544 --> 00:38:31,444
Will you look at this?

603
00:38:31,546 --> 00:38:34,948
It's incredible,
the things some people throw away.

604
00:38:35,051 --> 00:38:38,418
Steiff stuffed animals.
An Aurora model motoring set.

605
00:38:38,521 --> 00:38:40,819
A Derringer.
Do you remember the Derringer craze?

606
00:38:42,325 --> 00:38:44,225
These are the toys of our generation.

607
00:38:44,327 --> 00:38:47,227
The childhood of our whole generation
is represented here...

608
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:49,958
and they're just throwing it out.

609
00:38:50,067 --> 00:38:52,968
Maybe we should rescue
the electric car set.

610
00:38:53,071 --> 00:38:55,198
Could really add
to these after-parties.

611
00:38:58,408 --> 00:39:02,641
- Uh, I turn here.
- Oh. See you tonight.

612
00:39:02,747 --> 00:39:05,739
Listen, don't take this thing
with Charlie too seriously.

613
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,818
No. See you tonight.

614
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:22,925
My feeling is that what happened last night
had no real significance.

615
00:39:23,035 --> 00:39:25,470
It was just bad luck
that Fred got sick.

616
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,540
I can't believe
you're talking like this.

617
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,040
He totally humiliated you last night.

618
00:39:30,143 --> 00:39:34,239
Whether I've been humiliated or not
is something I can judge for myself.

619
00:39:34,347 --> 00:39:36,942
Besides, I don't think Tom's that way.

620
00:39:37,051 --> 00:39:40,213
Well, I'm not sure
you can judge for yourself.

621
00:39:40,321 --> 00:39:42,221
Be careful, Audrey.

622
00:39:42,323 --> 00:39:44,223
- There's something dubious about Tom.
- What?

623
00:39:44,325 --> 00:39:47,556
This whole thing about his being a radical
when he's obviously not...

624
00:39:47,661 --> 00:39:50,563
and being over Serena
when he's obviously not.

625
00:39:50,665 --> 00:39:53,030
Everyone has some contradictions.

626
00:39:53,134 --> 00:39:55,035
Anybody with
as many conflicts as Tom...

627
00:39:55,137 --> 00:39:57,628
even if he seems nice,
is better not to get involved with.

628
00:39:57,739 --> 00:40:00,139
By those standards,
none of us should get involved with anyone.

629
00:40:00,242 --> 00:40:02,301
Well,you're probably right,
but in this case certainly.

630
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:06,540
Tom is the only guy I've ever liked
in my whole life.

631
00:40:06,648 --> 00:40:10,380
I'm not gonna forget about him
because of some apparent inconsistencies.

632
00:40:10,486 --> 00:40:13,887
- You hardly even know him.
- I know him very well.

633
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:16,323
You couldn't.
You only just met him.

634
00:40:16,426 --> 00:40:18,894
Well, I do.

635
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:26,427
I didn't know
you sent out Christmas cards.

636
00:40:26,537 --> 00:40:28,437
Well, I haven't in years.

637
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:32,101
When we moved, do you know what happened
to my toys and things?

638
00:40:33,578 --> 00:40:35,546
They were put in storage.

639
00:40:35,647 --> 00:40:38,878
Do you think some of them
could have been sent to Dad's?

640
00:40:38,983 --> 00:40:41,543
It's possible.
Why? Do you want them?

641
00:40:41,653 --> 00:40:45,556
- You're a bit old for that sort of thing.
- No, I just had a feeling they went to Dad's.

642
00:40:45,658 --> 00:40:49,287
- Well, why don't you call him then?
- I have. There's been no answer.

643
00:40:58,505 --> 00:41:01,405
There's something about winter in the city
at night, with everyone dressed up...

644
00:41:01,507 --> 00:41:03,408
that reminds me of War and Peace.

645
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,410
- Really?
- Do you know what I mean?

646
00:41:05,513 --> 00:41:08,811
Yeah, I think so,
though I haven't read it.

647
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:18,491
Well, I don't think "preppy"
is a very useful term.

648
00:41:18,593 --> 00:41:21,790
I mean, it might be descriptive for
someone who is still in school or college...

649
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:26,800
but it's ridiculous to refer to a man in his 7 Os,
like Averell Harriman, as a preppy.

650
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:31,601
And none of the other terms people use -
WASP, P.L.U., et cetera - are of much use either.

651
00:41:31,707 --> 00:41:34,835
And that's why
I prefer the term "U.H.B."

652
00:41:34,943 --> 00:41:37,138
- What?
- U.H.B.

653
00:41:37,246 --> 00:41:40,307
It's an acronym for
urban haute bourgeoisie.

654
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:42,509
Is our language so impoverished...

655
00:41:42,619 --> 00:41:45,986
that we have to use acronyms or French phrases
to make ourselves understood?

656
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:48,990
- Yes.
- U.H.B.

657
00:41:49,093 --> 00:41:52,323
The term is brilliant
and long overdue.

658
00:41:52,428 --> 00:41:55,330
But it's a bit of a mouthful, isn't it -
U.H.B.?

659
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:59,960
Wouldn't it be better
just to pronounce it simply "UHB"?

660
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,972
Well, I didn't expect it
to gain immediate acceptance.

661
00:42:03,074 --> 00:42:07,135
No, no, I think it's a useful term. The fact that
it sounds ridiculous could be part of its appeal.

662
00:42:07,245 --> 00:42:09,645
You see the world from such lofty heights...

663
00:42:09,748 --> 00:42:12,717
that everything below
is a bit comical to you, isn't it?

664
00:42:14,986 --> 00:42:17,420
- Yes.
- You're so obnoxious.

665
00:42:19,425 --> 00:42:21,325
I don't see how you can stand him.

666
00:42:21,427 --> 00:42:24,590
You're always complaining about people
being frauds and phonies.

667
00:42:24,697 --> 00:42:27,098
Well, this guy is
the phony of the decade...

668
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,100
yet you act like
he was your long-lost best friend.

669
00:42:30,202 --> 00:42:34,104
Tom Townsend is hardly a phony-
just mildly deluded. He's a perfectly nice guy.

670
00:42:34,206 --> 00:42:37,665
That's just another aspect of his phoniness.
He's a complete phony.

671
00:42:37,778 --> 00:42:40,679
And when he's not being a phony,
h- he's a bastard.

672
00:42:40,781 --> 00:42:42,682
Oh, come on.

673
00:42:42,784 --> 00:42:45,684
- You saw how he treated Audrey last night.
- Audrey seems to have forgotten it.

674
00:42:45,786 --> 00:42:50,190
She has to act that way.
Otherwise, it would be even more humiliating.

675
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:53,693
But I don't have to pretend
that Tom Townsend's a nice guy.

676
00:42:53,796 --> 00:42:56,764
You're really gaga about Audrey,
aren't you?

677
00:42:56,864 --> 00:43:00,426
Well, if by "gaga"
you mean, "Do I like her?"...

678
00:43:00,535 --> 00:43:02,436
yeah.

679
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,939
Well, why don't you
do something about it then...

680
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,941
instead of just going on and on
about what a bastard Tom Townsend is.

681
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:11,604
What am I supposed to do? Declare myself?
That would be an absolute disaster.

682
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,616
And don't think
I haven't thought about these things.

683
00:43:14,784 --> 00:43:16,615
Yes, Rick and Serena broke up.

684
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,952
But this afternoon they both went down
to Washington for Holly Gilchrist's party.

685
00:43:20,057 --> 00:43:22,957
It was Holly who was responsible
for getting them together in the first place.

686
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:25,527
- Oh, so she was responsible.
- They went together?

687
00:43:25,629 --> 00:43:28,462
They went separately.
How they'll come back-

688
00:43:28,566 --> 00:43:31,126
I don't think that Rick is the sort of guy
who lets himself be dropped.

689
00:43:31,235 --> 00:43:34,033
- Ha!
- What is that supposed to mean?

690
00:43:34,138 --> 00:43:35,969
Ha!

691
00:43:36,073 --> 00:43:37,974
Rick really threatens you somehow.

692
00:43:38,075 --> 00:43:39,976
How does he threaten me?

693
00:43:40,078 --> 00:43:42,945
Maybe by being
more of a man than you are.

694
00:43:43,048 --> 00:43:45,642
- You stupid slut.
- Oh, come on.!

695
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:47,810
What has Rick done
that's so terrible?

696
00:43:47,919 --> 00:43:49,819
He is terrible.

697
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:52,652
I shouldn't have to go into
all the sordid details.

698
00:43:52,759 --> 00:43:54,886
Could you go into
a few sordid details?

699
00:43:54,994 --> 00:43:57,895
I don't think there are any reasons,
except for maybe jealousy.

700
00:43:57,997 --> 00:44:00,727
Rick makes him feel
terribly inadequate somehow.

701
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:04,792
Okay, I'll tell you
about Rick Von Sloneker.

702
00:44:08,941 --> 00:44:12,139
Does the name Polly Perkins
mean anything to you?

703
00:44:12,246 --> 00:44:14,009
Sounds familiar.

704
00:44:15,116 --> 00:44:17,016
She grew up in Virginia.

705
00:44:17,118 --> 00:44:19,018
A horse fanatic since childhood.

706
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,419
Went to one of those horsey girls schools -
Garrison Forest, I think.

707
00:44:22,524 --> 00:44:25,652
Sometime in her senior year
she started feeling depressed.

708
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,753
Now, partly it was finally
becoming disillusioned with horses.

709
00:44:28,863 --> 00:44:32,766
But there were some
real psychological problems too.

710
00:44:32,868 --> 00:44:36,770
That summer she got a job in Edgartown
and seemed completely recovered...

711
00:44:36,872 --> 00:44:39,774
except for a couple of idiosyncrasies -
she'd only dress in blue...

712
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:42,776
and she wouldn't eat hamburgers
unless they were completely well done.

713
00:44:42,878 --> 00:44:45,780
Any hint of redness
and she'd send them back.

714
00:44:45,882 --> 00:44:49,716
Out of loyalty to her boyfriend
in Virginia...

715
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,790
she'd only go on group dates,
never individual ones.

716
00:44:54,357 --> 00:44:57,986
Von Sloneker met her when
he came to Edgartown for the regatta.

717
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:01,697
She showed
no interest in him at all initially...

718
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:05,166
which makes sense because
he's a completely uninteresting guy.

719
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:07,795
But for someone like Von Sloneker,
that's just inciting.

720
00:45:07,906 --> 00:45:10,806
So he swung into action
with a full rigamarole...

721
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:13,433
about how desperately
in love he was with her...

722
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:16,571
how she was the first girl
that ever made him feel that way...

723
00:45:16,682 --> 00:45:18,513
how it was their obligation
to themselves...

724
00:45:18,617 --> 00:45:21,086
to do everything they could
to live life to the fullest.

725
00:45:21,187 --> 00:45:25,783
Polly had, meanwhile, quit her summer job
and joined his boat for the rest of the cruise.

726
00:45:25,892 --> 00:45:27,792
He now completely ignored her.

727
00:45:27,894 --> 00:45:30,362
She, in turn,
became obsessed with him.

728
00:45:31,965 --> 00:45:35,230
Polly was a bit of a masochist
and prone to drink too much.

729
00:45:36,804 --> 00:45:39,966
Von Sloneker exploited this
to get her drunk...

730
00:45:40,074 --> 00:45:41,974
and had her-

731
00:45:42,076 --> 00:45:44,806
Do you know what
"pulling a train" means?

732
00:45:45,847 --> 00:45:47,940
I don't think so.

733
00:45:50,185 --> 00:45:53,085
When Von Sloneker had gotten her
blind drunk one night...

734
00:45:53,187 --> 00:45:55,087
he talked her into pulling a train -

735
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:57,385
him, Victor Lemley,
the other crew member.

736
00:45:59,161 --> 00:46:03,325
When she arrived at Wheaton for her first
semester, she was acting very strangely...

737
00:46:03,432 --> 00:46:05,696
always wearing the same clothes...

738
00:46:05,801 --> 00:46:09,703
never washing, except just putting on
more and more makeup and perfume.

739
00:46:09,805 --> 00:46:11,705
She'd remain silent for hours...

740
00:46:11,807 --> 00:46:14,106
and then talk obsessively
about Paul McCartney.

741
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,980
After two weeks,
she was sent to McLean's for treatment...

742
00:46:19,082 --> 00:46:21,983
but was able to go home
to Virginia for Thanksgiving.

743
00:46:22,085 --> 00:46:24,986
The day after Thanksgiving,
she went into their stables...

744
00:46:25,088 --> 00:46:27,215
and killed herself.

745
00:46:27,325 --> 00:46:30,589
I've heard about that girl,
and it wasn't Rick's fault.

746
00:46:30,694 --> 00:46:33,630
She was just some girl who had a crush on him,
but whom he hardly knew.

747
00:46:33,731 --> 00:46:38,566
She'd always had psychological problems
and was, in fact, a pathological liar.

748
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:41,867
It was very sad what happened,
but Rick had absolutely nothing to do with it.

749
00:46:41,973 --> 00:46:43,941
I don't know.

750
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,805
She was carrying his photo
when she killed herself.

751
00:46:47,912 --> 00:46:50,347
That doesn't mean anything.

752
00:46:51,383 --> 00:46:53,442
- What an appalling story.
- Yep.

753
00:46:53,552 --> 00:46:55,452
Not many people could know about it.

754
00:46:55,554 --> 00:46:57,955
Von Sloneker could hardly
show his face around here.

755
00:46:58,058 --> 00:47:00,959
- You really showed up Cynthia. Whew.
- Yeah.

756
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,188
That's what made it
worthwhile for me.

757
00:47:03,296 --> 00:47:05,197
What do you mean?

758
00:47:05,299 --> 00:47:07,460
- There is no Polly Perkins.
- What?

759
00:47:07,568 --> 00:47:10,695
- There's no girl. I made it up.
- You're kidding!

760
00:47:10,804 --> 00:47:14,296
I couldn't let Cynthia get away
with that nonsense about Von Sloneker.

761
00:47:14,407 --> 00:47:19,311
And basically it's all true. I mean, Von Sloneker's
doing those kinds of things all the time.

762
00:47:19,413 --> 00:47:22,508
Though Polly Perkins is,
essentially, a composite...

763
00:47:22,618 --> 00:47:25,518
based on real people,
like New York magazine does.

764
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:29,853
- But Cynthia said she knew all about her.
- Yeah. That was priceless.

765
00:47:29,958 --> 00:47:33,519
I think it just shows that Von Sloneker's
doing those sorts of things.

766
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:36,530
But you really do have some factual basis
for saying all those things about him?

767
00:47:36,632 --> 00:47:38,930

Um,Jane? Are you familiar

805
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,111
Who?

806
00:50:58,216 --> 00:51:01,982
Girls And Sex by Wardell B. Pomeroy.

807
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:07,252
"The long-needed modern guide
to the understanding of girls growing up. "

808
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:11,591
"'The most frank and objective
book currently available. ' Library Journal. "

809
00:51:11,697 --> 00:51:13,892
Oh, that.

810
00:51:13,999 --> 00:51:18,663
"The years of puberty and early womanhood
are difficult, even frightening, for many girls.

811
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:21,898
"This is the time they most need
objective, factual information...

812
00:51:22,007 --> 00:51:25,807
and sympathetic advice about
their physical and emotional changes. "

813
00:51:25,911 --> 00:51:28,813
You know, we don't have enough for two tables.
There's only seven of us.

814
00:51:28,915 --> 00:51:31,713
- That's impossible.
- Tom's not here yet.

815
00:51:31,818 --> 00:51:33,649
Is he coming?

816
00:51:33,753 --> 00:51:37,450
Sure. He is coming, isn't he?

817
00:51:38,592 --> 00:51:41,789
- You didn't call him?
- I thought there were eight of us. He would have been the ninth.

818
00:51:41,896 --> 00:51:44,956
- You told me that he - - Well,just call him
up. I'm sure he isn't doing anything else.

819
00:51:45,065 --> 00:51:48,364
Well, surely there's - there's someone else
in New York who can play bridge...

820
00:51:48,469 --> 00:51:50,494
other than Tom Townsend.

821
00:51:50,604 --> 00:51:52,572
I mean, you know, seven can play.

822
00:51:52,673 --> 00:51:54,801
What have you got against Tom?

823
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:57,538
Just one thing -
He's not - not a good person.

824
00:51:57,646 --> 00:52:00,308
- Oh, what nonsense.
- Oh, all right. Go ahead.

825
00:52:00,415 --> 00:52:02,350
Call him if you want.
I don't care.

826
00:52:02,451 --> 00:52:05,977
Actually, I don't think Tom approves of bridge,
but we should ask him anyway.

827
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,228
Well, have a seat.

828
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:17,255
Then just say you pass.

829
00:52:17,366 --> 00:52:19,266
I pass.

830
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:24,029
I couldn't believe you were actually going to
play bridge. It's such a cliché of bourgeois life.

831
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:27,577
That's exactly why I play.
I don't enjoy it one bit.

832
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:31,047
I intended to go
and got as far as the door.

833
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:33,947
- What happened?
- My mother got upset.

834
00:52:34,052 --> 00:52:36,350
She said that she couldn't face
being alone on Christmas Eve...

835
00:52:36,454 --> 00:52:39,685
and that it was really important
that the family be together then.

836
00:52:39,791 --> 00:52:42,260
My brother never comes home
at Christmas anymore.

837
00:52:42,361 --> 00:52:46,354
So, anyway, I just stayed and had a traditional
Christmas with Channel 11 's traditional yule log.

838
00:52:46,465 --> 00:52:49,195
Oh, yeah. I think I've seen that.

839
00:52:49,301 --> 00:52:53,203
Noon on Christmas Day, every other year,
we go to my father's place.

840
00:52:53,305 --> 00:52:57,402
I was a bit reluctant to go this year, actually, because
I hadn't been able to get in touch with my father all week.

841
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:00,206
But my mother insisted.
It was a real nightmare.

842
00:53:00,313 --> 00:53:02,781
First, the doorman at my father's building
wouldn't let me up.

843
00:53:02,881 --> 00:53:06,181
I guess he didn't remember me there
from Christmas two years ago.

844
00:53:06,286 --> 00:53:08,413
Then there was
some confusion and whispering...

845
00:53:08,521 --> 00:53:12,515
and, finally, they gave me a piece of paper
with a Santa Fe, New Mexico address on it.

846
00:53:12,626 --> 00:53:16,562
They told me he'd moved to Santa Fe.
I couldn't believe it.

847
00:53:16,664 --> 00:53:19,656
They took me up to the apartment,
and except for some paper and litter...

848
00:53:19,767 --> 00:53:23,635
and wire coat hangers lying around,
it was completely empty.

849
00:53:23,738 --> 00:53:26,503
He hadn't told me
anything about moving.

850
00:53:26,608 --> 00:53:29,405
It was quite a surprise.

851
00:53:29,511 --> 00:53:32,810
That's awful.
There must be some explanation.

852
00:53:32,914 --> 00:53:35,679
He must have written you or something,
and the letter got delayed.

853
00:53:35,785 --> 00:53:38,412
I don't know.

854
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,613
And you had such a good relationship.

855
00:53:40,722 --> 00:53:45,092
In retrospect, I wonder how good it was.
I hadn't seen him since last spring.

856
00:53:45,194 --> 00:53:47,458
Maybe I was just kidding myself.

857
00:53:50,367 --> 00:53:52,733
Oh, I've been reading Jane Austen.
Persuasion.

858
00:53:52,836 --> 00:53:55,804
I like it. I was surprised.

859
00:54:12,992 --> 00:54:15,892
The titled aristocracy
are the scum of the Earth.

860
00:54:15,994 --> 00:54:18,793
What really makes me furious
is that you have a whole class of people-

861
00:54:18,898 --> 00:54:21,731
mostly Europeans-
all looking down at me.

862
00:54:21,834 --> 00:54:25,770
You always say "titled aristocrats. "
What about untitled aristocrats?

863
00:54:25,871 --> 00:54:28,602
I couldn't very well despise them,
could I?

864
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:31,574
That would be self-hatred,
which is unhealthy.

865
00:54:31,677 --> 00:54:33,611
You're so conceited.

866
00:54:33,712 --> 00:54:36,682
Well, saying that the titled aristocracy
are the scum of the Earth...

867
00:54:36,783 --> 00:54:39,651
is -well, is obviously
an exaggeration.

868
00:54:39,754 --> 00:54:43,052
But - But it's true that the forces
that oblige members of the U.H.B...

869
00:54:43,156 --> 00:54:46,717
to at least appear to act
productively and responsibly...

870
00:54:46,827 --> 00:54:48,795
carries little weight,
or none at all...

871
00:54:48,895 --> 00:54:52,662
with members of society whose social positions
are secure no matter what they do.

872
00:54:57,939 --> 00:55:01,740
So you had a trust fund?
The pieces are beginning to fall into place.

873
00:55:01,844 --> 00:55:04,312
I don't have one anymore.

874
00:55:04,413 --> 00:55:06,381
Well, that's less important.

875
00:55:06,482 --> 00:55:10,476
I mean, so-so - sociologically,
I mean, what's important is...

876
00:55:10,587 --> 00:55:13,419
having grown up with the assumption
of material security.

877
00:55:13,522 --> 00:55:16,185
It - It explains a lot.

878
00:55:16,292 --> 00:55:18,192
I call.

879
00:55:19,696 --> 00:55:21,597
I had no cards.
Why did you call?

880
00:55:21,699 --> 00:55:23,963
I felt like it.

881
00:55:24,067 --> 00:55:27,526
Playing strip poker with an exhibitionist
somehow takes the challenge away.

882
00:55:32,409 --> 00:55:36,779
His name is Frank Goodrich.
He handles some financial things for my father.

883
00:55:36,882 --> 00:55:40,249
Actually, it's a tremendous relief,
not having that hanging over my head anymore.

884
00:55:40,352 --> 00:55:42,252
Really?

885
00:55:42,354 --> 00:55:45,323
There was a big load of guilt that went with it,
even though it wasn't that much money...

886
00:55:45,423 --> 00:55:48,052
and I never really counted
on having it.

887
00:55:48,161 --> 00:55:51,927
You're a tragic case. You've just been robbed,
and it's a great relief to you.

888
00:55:52,031 --> 00:55:53,999
In part, regarding the money.

889
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:57,228
Regarding my relationship with my father,
of course I'm concerned.

890
00:55:57,336 --> 00:55:59,327
He moves to another state
without telling me...

891
00:55:59,438 --> 00:56:01,407
he doesn't write or call me
for over a month...

892
00:56:01,508 --> 00:56:03,975
and basically has me disinherited.

893
00:56:04,076 --> 00:56:08,172
- Obviously, our relationship is not what I thought it was.
- Geez.

894
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:12,742
It's as if he were incredibly angry with me,
but I can't think of why.

895
00:56:12,853 --> 00:56:15,378
- I don't know what it could be.
- You don't?

896
00:56:15,489 --> 00:56:17,116
No.

897
00:56:19,193 --> 00:56:22,561
One word - "stepmother. "

898
00:56:25,099 --> 00:56:28,364
Well, I hope I can talk to them
and straighten things out.

899
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:32,701
I'm sure nothing you did or said
has anything to do with it...

900
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:36,244
and nothing you say or do
will change anything.

901
00:56:36,345 --> 00:56:39,008
- That's awfully pessimistic.
- It's the way things are.

902
00:56:40,549 --> 00:56:42,848
The most important thing
to realize about parents...

903
00:56:42,953 --> 00:56:45,819
is that there's absolutely nothing
you can do about them.

904
00:56:47,524 --> 00:56:49,822
You look terrific.

905
00:56:49,926 --> 00:56:51,826
You like it?

906
00:56:51,928 --> 00:56:54,454
- This is really decadent.
- This is nothing.

907
00:57:09,715 --> 00:57:14,152
- Something's happened to Nick.
- It's my head.

908
00:57:14,253 --> 00:57:17,416
- It's my head. It's my head.
- What's happened?

909
00:57:17,522 --> 00:57:19,990
There was this guy at school
Nick liked to imitate saying this.

910
00:57:20,092 --> 00:57:22,926
He had taken mescaline, and he
went around doing this about his head.

911
00:57:23,029 --> 00:57:25,758
- It's my head. It's my head.
- "It's my head. "

912
00:57:25,864 --> 00:57:29,995
- Nick took mescaline?
- No. I mean, it was the other guy, Voss.

913
00:57:30,103 --> 00:57:32,628
- We did take mescaline.
- You what?

914
00:57:32,739 --> 00:57:35,800
He shouldn't be reacting this way though.
I don't know what happened.

915
00:57:35,909 --> 00:57:37,809
It was really mild.

916
00:57:39,212 --> 00:57:41,181
Are you joking?

917
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,020
It's called Truth.

918
00:57:48,122 --> 00:57:51,388
You stretch a Kleenex over the mouth
of a glass and place a dime on it.

919
00:57:51,493 --> 00:57:54,222
We each take turns
burning a hole in it with a cigarette.

920
00:57:54,328 --> 00:57:57,264
If the dime falls in on your turn,
you lose...

921
00:57:57,365 --> 00:57:59,993
and you have to answer,
with absolute honesty...

922
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:03,559
whatever question you're asked,
no matter how embarrassing.

923
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,337
Yeah. The more embarrassing,
the better.

924
00:58:13,316 --> 00:58:15,410
What are you reading?

925
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:17,487
The Story of Babar.

926
00:58:19,389 --> 00:58:21,357
I forgot how beautiful it was.

927
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,726
Sometimes you can find out
the most amazing things.

928
00:58:25,829 --> 00:58:27,729
It can really be incredible.

929
00:58:27,831 --> 00:58:31,597
- I don't think we should play this.
- Why not?

930
00:58:31,702 --> 00:58:35,366
There are good reasons why people don't go around
telling each other their most intimate thoughts.

931
00:58:35,473 --> 00:58:37,373
What do you have to hide?

932
00:58:37,475 --> 00:58:40,444
No, I just know that games like this
can be really dangerous.

933
00:58:40,545 --> 00:58:43,070
- Dangerous?
- I don't see what's dangerous about it.

934
00:58:43,181 --> 00:58:47,949
You don't have to. Other people have.
That's how it became a convention.

935
00:58:48,053 --> 00:58:50,613
People saw the harm
that excessive candor can do.

936
00:58:50,723 --> 00:58:53,352
You admit that it's basically
just a social convention then.

937
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:56,019
What you say might be true among people
who don't know each other well...

938
00:58:56,128 --> 00:58:58,028
but surely not with us.

939
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:02,033
- Then it's even worse.
- Okay. Let's discuss this.

940
00:59:02,135 --> 00:59:05,161
Basically, what this game requires
is complete candor...

941
00:59:05,271 --> 00:59:07,796
which means honesty, openness.

942
00:59:07,907 --> 00:59:10,034
I don't see how that can be bad.

943
00:59:10,143 --> 00:59:11,906
Well, it can.

944
00:59:12,011 --> 00:59:15,038
Well, then don't play,
but don't wreck it for everyone else.

945
00:59:15,149 --> 00:59:18,550
No, if we're going to play, we all should.
That's the whole point.

946
00:59:18,652 --> 00:59:22,679
I think if one of us isn't going to play,
then none of us should.

947
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:27,421
- I mean, maybe Audrey's right.
- Come on. Let's not disagree.

948
00:59:27,529 --> 00:59:29,997
You're really both saying
the same thing -

949
00:59:30,098 --> 00:59:32,157
Either we should all play
or none of us should.

950
00:59:32,267 --> 00:59:35,237
Well, it's really all up to Audrey then.

951
00:59:38,306 --> 00:59:42,174
- Well, this isn't fair. If Audrey doesn't -
- No. Go ahead. I'll play.

952
01:00:03,133 --> 01:00:06,934
- What now?
- You get to ask me the most embarrassing question you can think of.

953
01:00:07,038 --> 01:00:10,007
- I'm supposed to ask you the most
embarrassing question I can think of? - Uh-huh.

954
01:00:10,108 --> 01:00:12,634
What's the most embarrassing thing
that's ever happened to you?

955
01:00:12,745 --> 01:00:14,713
No, something specific.

956
01:00:16,147 --> 01:00:19,117
Like who was your most recent conquest?
Something like that.

957
01:00:19,218 --> 01:00:22,676
- Who was your most recent conquest?
- You mean, who did I sleep with last?

958
01:00:22,788 --> 01:00:25,256
- You don't have to answer that.
- No, it's okay. I'm not embarrassed.

959
01:00:25,357 --> 01:00:28,122
I have nothing to hide.
It was Nick.

960
01:00:29,628 --> 01:00:31,654
After all that
about what a slut she was.

961
01:00:31,765 --> 01:00:34,529
But a very attractive slut.

962
01:00:34,634 --> 01:00:38,092
So,you're just another hypocrite.

963
01:00:38,205 --> 01:00:41,300
That's not hypocrisy. It's sin.

964
01:00:41,409 --> 01:00:43,377
It was hardly that.

965
01:00:55,189 --> 01:00:57,090
Oh!

966
01:00:57,191 --> 01:00:59,092
I have a question.

967
01:00:59,194 --> 01:01:01,526
With absolute honesty and frankness...

968
01:01:01,629 --> 01:01:04,098
list all the girls you're
interested in romantically...

969
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:08,761
in descending order of interest, and why,
including significant detail.

970
01:01:10,073 --> 01:01:11,973
I thought that was pretty obvious.

971
01:01:12,075 --> 01:01:15,442
I've had a crush on Serena,
with some ups and downs, for over two years.

972
01:01:15,545 --> 01:01:18,947
Recently it seems to have developed
into something more serious.

973
01:01:19,049 --> 01:01:21,710
But who else do you like romantically?

974
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:24,988
I don't think it works that way.

975
01:01:25,089 --> 01:01:28,490
If you're really interested in one person,
you're not interested in anyone else.

976
01:01:28,592 --> 01:01:30,856
I suppose it's possible,
but what's the point?

977
01:01:30,961 --> 01:01:34,193
But if that doesn't work out,
there must be someone else.

978
01:01:35,766 --> 01:01:39,463
If it doesn't work out this time,
I'll be off romance for a long time.

979
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:43,268
I suppose this is embarrassing,
but it's hardly a revelation.

980
01:01:49,849 --> 01:01:53,080
I'm sorry I asked him that.
It was my fault.

981
01:01:55,488 --> 01:01:59,117
I always think other people are foolish.
I'm the big fool.

982
01:02:02,863 --> 01:02:07,266
It's better for her to know the truth. I don't see
how knowing the truth could do anyone any harm.

983
01:02:07,367 --> 01:02:09,892
It's not just the truth.
It's how and when you learn it.

984
01:02:10,003 --> 01:02:11,972
I don't accept that.

985
01:02:13,407 --> 01:02:16,036
I mean, you -
you were right about that game.

986
01:02:16,144 --> 01:02:18,408
It's terrible.

987
01:02:18,513 --> 01:02:22,711
You know, you may not realize it, Audrey,
but everyone li - likes you a lot.

988
01:02:22,817 --> 01:02:25,615
Thank you, but I find that
very hard to believe.

989
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:28,120
It's the truth.

990
01:02:28,222 --> 01:02:32,591
And it's not just because
you're smart and good-looking and -

991
01:02:32,695 --> 01:02:36,358
and charming and have principles.

992
01:02:36,464 --> 01:02:40,425
It's because they can see that-
that you're a good person.

993
01:02:40,537 --> 01:02:43,005
If you want to tease me,
this is not the best time.

994
01:02:43,105 --> 01:02:46,542
I mean, maybe this isn't the best time,
but for some time now, I-

995
01:02:48,678 --> 01:02:50,805
Well, I like you very much.

996
01:02:50,914 --> 01:02:53,543
I mean, I-I know that
you don't yet feel that way, but -

997
01:02:53,651 --> 01:02:55,619
No, please. Stop.

998
01:03:03,494 --> 01:03:07,453
Doesn't Serena look awful here?
She's not exactly photogenic.

999
01:03:07,565 --> 01:03:09,534
There's one of you and Tom.

1000
01:03:12,203 --> 01:03:14,194
There it is.

1001
01:03:22,115 --> 01:03:24,913
- Maybe Cynthia's right.
- That's impossible.

1002
01:03:25,017 --> 01:03:29,352
Her essential view is experience is good,
and she's set out to acquire it.

1003
01:03:29,454 --> 01:03:32,652
I've been just the opposite.
Everything's been in my imagination.

1004
01:03:32,759 --> 01:03:34,989
All the romance imaginary,
nothing real.

1005
01:03:35,094 --> 01:03:37,620
- She's a slut.
- That's what Nick says.

1006
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:40,063
- He proved it.
- That's unfair.

1007
01:03:40,167 --> 01:03:42,067
I don't think so.

1008
01:03:44,405 --> 01:03:47,568
I'm catching the dawn train upstate
to East Aurora.

1009
01:03:47,675 --> 01:03:49,643
My father's place.

1010
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:52,041
It's the first time
they've invited me in years.

1011
01:03:52,146 --> 01:03:56,277
I can't help wondering why my stepmother's
suddenly so willing to have me come.

1012
01:03:58,353 --> 01:04:02,756
If I should die while there, would you see
that there's a thorough investigation...

1013
01:04:02,857 --> 01:04:06,658
even if it looks like an accident
or natural causes?

1014
01:04:06,762 --> 01:04:09,560
- Would you promise me that?
- Yes.

1015
01:04:11,333 --> 01:04:15,793
Even if I do return alive, I don't think I'll be
attending any more dances after this one.

1016
01:04:15,905 --> 01:04:19,603
With everything that's going on, this is
probably the last deb season as we know it.

1017
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:22,178
I don't want to just hang around,
watching the decline.

1018
01:04:22,279 --> 01:04:24,975
- Everyone's going tonight?
- No. Just me.

1019
01:04:26,083 --> 01:04:29,951
The International
is an inorganic debutante ball.

1020
01:04:30,054 --> 01:04:32,955
The others were natural outgrowths
of local UHB formations.

1021
01:04:33,057 --> 01:04:35,684
This was assembled
like a tourist attraction.

1022
01:04:37,562 --> 01:04:40,190
Each girl has two escorts -

1023
01:04:40,298 --> 01:04:43,233
one, a cadet in uniform
from one of the service academies...

1024
01:04:43,335 --> 01:04:45,803
the other a civilian like myself.

1025
01:04:45,904 --> 01:04:48,236
And the whole thing's televised
on Channel 9.

1026
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:51,537
- You're kidding.
- No.

1027
01:04:51,643 --> 01:04:54,373
I guess you could say
it's extremely vulgar.

1028
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,109
I like it a lot.

1029
01:04:57,217 --> 01:05:00,880
And these Texas and Oklahoma debs
are really nice...

1030
01:05:00,987 --> 01:05:04,787
a real relief from
these hypercritical New York girls.

1031
01:05:04,891 --> 01:05:06,416
What's everyone else doing then?

1032
01:05:07,594 --> 01:05:10,291
I imagine they'll be glued
to the set.

1033
01:05:10,397 --> 01:05:13,798
From the state of Texas, Miss Sabina Johnston...

1034
01:05:13,901 --> 01:05:16,529
daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Roderick Johnston.

1035
01:05:16,637 --> 01:05:19,607
- She's cute.
- But what about the dress?

1036
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:22,835
Nick said he thought this would be
the last real deb season.

1037
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:26,401
- How come?
- Because of everything going on.

1038
01:05:26,514 --> 01:05:30,714
- Like what?
- Well, everything.

1039
01:05:32,487 --> 01:05:36,515
The stock market, the economy,
c- contemporary social attitudes.

1040
01:05:36,626 --> 01:05:39,356
Is Audrey coming tonight?

1041
01:05:39,462 --> 01:05:41,929
She said she felt tired
and thought she'd stay at home.

1042
01:05:42,031 --> 01:05:45,398
She can watch Channel 9
equally well from there.

1043
01:05:45,501 --> 01:05:48,027
From the state of
Kentucky- -

1044
01:05:48,138 --> 01:05:50,106
- I'll get it.
- Thanks.

1045
01:05:53,944 --> 01:05:56,913
Miss McLean, Mr. Von Sloneker coming up.

1046
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:02,987
Um, Cynthia's coming up
with-with Rick Von Sloneker.

1047
01:06:03,087 --> 01:06:05,817
- Oh, she mentioned they might come by.
- What would Nick say?

1048
01:06:05,924 --> 01:06:09,223
What Nick says or thinks
I couldn't care less.

1049
01:06:13,698 --> 01:06:15,791
I'll get it.

1050
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:20,235
See you. Hi! Hi!

1051
01:06:20,339 --> 01:06:23,934
This is Rick Von Sloneker
and Victor Lemley.

1052
01:06:24,043 --> 01:06:27,069
- Tom Townsend.
- I've heard a lot about you.

1053
01:06:27,179 --> 01:06:31,776
Of course you have.
So, who was talking about me?

1054
01:06:31,885 --> 01:06:35,480
- Nick Smith?
- Yes, actually.

1055
01:06:35,589 --> 01:06:37,784
That jerk. How could anyone
take him seriously?

1056
01:06:37,891 --> 01:06:41,827
- He's just a jerk.
- I think he feels incredibly threatened by you.

1057
01:06:41,928 --> 01:06:44,523
- What a clown.
- Is it true you're a baron?

1058
01:06:44,632 --> 01:06:46,998
As a matter of fact, it is.

1059
01:06:47,101 --> 01:06:49,763
I don't take that sort of thing
seriously though.

1060
01:06:49,871 --> 01:06:52,340
That was Audrey.
She is coming after all.

1061
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,341
- Oh, Audrey Rouget?
- Uh-huh.

1062
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:57,970
- She's getting pretty attractive.
- What are we watching?

1063
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,674
Oh, the International.

1064
01:07:00,782 --> 01:07:04,809
In a little bit more than an hour,
the, uh, season will be over.

1065
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:08,287
You really take that sort
of thing seriously? I can't.

1066
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:11,224
There are a lot of things
you don't take very seriously.

1067
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:13,818
One could get the impression
you're not a very serious person.

1068
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:18,800
Who is this guy, some Nick Smith impersonator?
I was already sick of the original.

1069
01:07:18,902 --> 01:07:21,462
Yeah, Tom, cut it out.
That's really gotten tiresome.

1070
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:24,541
The things that Nick said
were completely untrue.

1071
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:29,270
I'm sorry about last night.
I didn't mean what I said.

1072
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:34,977
No. I mean, it was idiotic of me
to... approach you that way.

1073
01:07:35,085 --> 01:07:38,544
- I hadn't intended to.
- No, it wasn't idiotic.

1074
01:07:45,764 --> 01:07:47,959
Miss Sabina Johnston
of Tyler, Texas...

1075
01:07:48,066 --> 01:07:51,195
and Cadet Lieutenant George Frawley
of our armed services.

1076
01:07:51,304 --> 01:07:53,204
- Hello.
- Hi.

1077
01:07:56,776 --> 01:07:59,142
- I still have a feeling.
- It's his age.

1078
01:07:59,245 --> 01:08:02,340
I go away for a couple of hours,
and you have Von Sloneker up here?

1079
01:08:02,449 --> 01:08:05,474
- I can invite anyone I want.
- So you invited him.

1080
01:08:05,584 --> 01:08:09,351
I didn't, but even if I did,
it's none of your business.

1081
01:08:09,456 --> 01:08:12,357
How can you say that?
I mean, you know what kind of guy he is.

1082
01:08:12,459 --> 01:08:16,361
I don't. It's just what you say,
and you're completely untrustworthy.

1083
01:08:16,463 --> 01:08:19,433
- Not about something serious.
- Hey, Smith!

1084
01:08:19,534 --> 01:08:23,231
You're a liar. I've heard the crap
you've been telling about me.

1085
01:08:23,338 --> 01:08:27,468
- Ah, you have?
- Yeah, about some girl I supposedly mistreated.

1086
01:08:27,575 --> 01:08:31,671
A Polly Perkins? There isn't any Polly Perkins.
You know that.

1087
01:08:31,779 --> 01:08:35,511
Such a girl never even existed.

1088
01:08:35,617 --> 01:08:38,143
Go on. Tell 'em. You made it up.

1089
01:08:39,822 --> 01:08:41,916
Is this true?

1090
01:08:42,025 --> 01:08:43,925
Yes and no.

1091
01:08:44,027 --> 01:08:46,154
- Oh, God, Nick!
- You did make it up.

1092
01:08:46,262 --> 01:08:50,323
There is no one Polly Perkins.
There are many of them.

1093
01:08:50,433 --> 01:08:52,731
So you admit you lied!

1094
01:08:52,836 --> 01:08:55,999
Polly Perkins is a composite,
like New York magazine does.

1095
01:08:58,109 --> 01:09:00,202
Name one girl.

1096
01:09:00,311 --> 01:09:02,779
Girls that have been degraded by you
don't need the further humiliation...

1097
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,840
of having their names bandied about
non-exclusive Park Avenue after-parties.

1098
01:09:06,951 --> 01:09:11,286
- You see? There isn't one.
- This looks really bad, Nick.

1099
01:09:15,527 --> 01:09:18,087
Cathy Livingstone. No more harm
can be done to her now.

1100
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:21,256
I had nothing to do with that,
and, anyway, she was completely unstable.

1101
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:25,736
Oh, that didn't stop you from boozing her up and then
talking her into pulling a train for you and Lemley.

1102
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:29,068
- That is not how it happened.
- Aw, what did happen, Ricky?

1103
01:09:29,175 --> 01:09:32,269
Anything that happened
between Cathy Livingstone and myself...

1104
01:09:32,378 --> 01:09:35,507
is entirely private
and entirely personal...

1105
01:09:35,616 --> 01:09:38,813
and had nothing to do with her suicide,
which was months afterwards.

1106
01:09:38,919 --> 01:09:42,116
She kept trying to call and talk to you,
but you wouldn't even see her.!

1107
01:09:42,222 --> 01:09:46,659
I liked Cathy, but sometimes these things don't
work out, and a clean break is usually the best.

1108
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:50,925
Oh, spare us this fake sensitivity.
Are her panties still in your collection?

1109
01:09:51,032 --> 01:09:53,295
Rick keeps a collection of panties
of the girls that he's seduced.

1110
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:57,428
Oh, when they later kill themselves, do you
do anything special to memorialize them?

1111
01:09:57,540 --> 01:10:01,499
I don't let anyone
say that kind of thing to my face.

1112
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:04,078
Before you complained
that I said it behind your back.

1113
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:07,240
Now it's that it's to your face.
Frankly, how can you tell which is which?

1114
01:10:12,321 --> 01:10:15,223
He had that coming for a long time.

1115
01:10:19,429 --> 01:10:21,897
How dare he hit me!

1116
01:10:21,997 --> 01:10:24,489
He's the scoundrel.
I should have thrashed him.

1117
01:10:24,601 --> 01:10:26,501
Well, you missed your chance.

1118
01:10:26,603 --> 01:10:31,735
I would have if I hadn't been doing my damnedest
not to splatter blood all over the apartment.

1119
01:10:31,843 --> 01:10:34,277
I got back, he was gone.
Nobody did anything to help me.

1120
01:10:34,378 --> 01:10:36,846
I'm facing one of the worst guys
of modern times...

1121
01:10:36,948 --> 01:10:39,315
and all I get's this whining criticism -

1122
01:10:39,418 --> 01:10:41,648
"Oh, this looks really bad, Nick. "

1123
01:10:41,753 --> 01:10:44,050
Why should we believe you over Rick?

1124
01:10:44,155 --> 01:10:48,183
We know you're a hypocrite. We know
your Polly Perkins story was a fabrication.

1125
01:10:48,293 --> 01:10:50,853
A composite!

1126
01:10:50,963 --> 01:10:53,955
That you're totally impossible and out of control
with some sort of drug problem...

1127
01:10:54,066 --> 01:10:56,900
and a fixation on what you consider
Rick Von Sloneker's wickedness.

1128
01:10:57,003 --> 01:11:00,905
You're a snob, a sexist,
totally obnoxious and tiresome...

1129
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:02,975
and, lately, you've gotten just weird.

1130
01:11:03,076 --> 01:11:07,673
- Why should we believe anything you say?
- I am not tiresome.

1131
01:11:07,781 --> 01:11:09,749
What's Rick to you anyway?

1132
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:11,875
Your shy friend hits me in the face...

1133
01:11:11,986 --> 01:11:15,945
I'm about to go upstate to the domain of
a stepmother of untrammeled malevolence...

1134
01:11:16,056 --> 01:11:18,024
very possibly to be killed...

1135
01:11:18,125 --> 01:11:20,355
and I get this.

1136
01:11:20,461 --> 01:11:23,260
Well, who could blame her?

1137
01:11:23,365 --> 01:11:27,802
If not spattering blood was your objective,
you weren't terribly successful.

1138
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:34,038
Well...

1139
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:36,236
I'm going to Grand Central.

1140
01:11:36,345 --> 01:11:38,279
The people are friendlier.

1141
01:11:38,381 --> 01:11:40,781
I'll help you with your stuff.

1142
01:11:41,817 --> 01:11:44,445
Why don't we all go see Nick off?

1143
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:58,189
Even within this group,
there are certain standards.

1144
01:11:58,302 --> 01:12:01,271
Apparently,
I failed to live up to them.

1145
01:12:04,709 --> 01:12:09,169
- Thanks for coming. Will you write?
- Yes.

1146
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,874
- Good-bye. Thanks for coming.
- Good-bye, sir.

1147
01:12:12,917 --> 01:12:14,851
- Good-bye, Tom.
- Good luck.

1148
01:12:14,953 --> 01:12:19,823
I leave, counting on you and Charlie to maintain
the standards and ideals of the U.H.B.

1149
01:12:19,925 --> 01:12:21,893
I've obviously failed to.

1150
01:12:21,994 --> 01:12:24,622
You and Charlie are the only ones
who understand this kind of thing.

1151
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:26,698
- What?
- Here.

1152
01:12:26,799 --> 01:12:28,960
Thank you.

1153
01:12:29,069 --> 01:12:31,537
- Oh. Also, you remember, in case I die -
- Yes.

1154
01:12:31,638 --> 01:12:34,072
- All right. Good-bye.
- Bye.

1155
01:12:34,174 --> 01:12:36,074
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

1156
01:13:03,872 --> 01:13:06,842
Is the 21 Club very expensive?

1157
01:13:06,943 --> 01:13:08,843
I believe so.

1158
01:13:11,014 --> 01:13:12,641
That's priceless.

1159
01:13:12,749 --> 01:13:16,048
And then she told Miss Radford,
"They look awfully big for mice. "

1160
01:13:16,152 --> 01:13:18,052
- She believed it?
- Oh, completely.

1161
01:13:18,154 --> 01:13:20,054
Oh, that's priceless.

1162
01:13:20,157 --> 01:13:23,023
You mentioned something about it
in one of your letters.

1163
01:13:23,126 --> 01:13:26,585
When I was going through some stuff over
Christmas, I found a packet of your old letters.

1164
01:13:26,697 --> 01:13:29,461
- You saved my letters?
- Of course.

1165
01:13:29,566 --> 01:13:33,093
I save all the personal letters I get.
Don't you?

1166
01:13:33,203 --> 01:13:35,900
No.

1167
01:13:36,007 --> 01:13:38,531
You mean, you threw away
all the letters I wrote you?

1168
01:13:38,642 --> 01:13:40,610
I throw away nearly everything.

1169
01:13:40,711 --> 01:13:44,375
I don't want to go through the rest of my life
with the mail I got when I was 16.

1170
01:13:44,482 --> 01:13:46,382
I'm surprised.

1171
01:13:46,484 --> 01:13:50,113
Someone goes through the trouble
of writing you a real letter, I save it.

1172
01:13:50,221 --> 01:13:52,349
People don't write
many personal letters anymore.

1173
01:13:52,458 --> 01:13:55,018
People in boarding school do.

1174
01:13:56,729 --> 01:13:58,924
And what if someone who wrote you
becomes famous?

1175
01:13:59,031 --> 01:14:03,161
Those letters could be the only record of what they were
thinking at that time. Crucial for their biographers.

1176
01:14:03,269 --> 01:14:06,762
Anybody who writes me who expects
to become famous should keep carbons.

1177
01:14:08,742 --> 01:14:11,371
It just seems to me
that it's a kind of trust.

1178
01:14:11,478 --> 01:14:16,381
If someone takes the trouble to write you
a substantial letter, you do not throw it out.

1179
01:14:17,752 --> 01:14:21,119
I didn't save your letters,
but I didn't throw them out.

1180
01:14:21,222 --> 01:14:24,556
I don't understand.
Is that a riddle?

1181
01:14:24,659 --> 01:14:28,186
There was a girl at school
who had some kind of a crush on you.

1182
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:32,358
She came into my room when I was throwing
things out, so I gave her your letters.

1183
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:34,368
Really?

1184
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:37,598
I know it sounds queer.

1185
01:14:37,707 --> 01:14:40,903
- She kept them?
- Mmm. I'm sure.

1186
01:14:41,009 --> 01:14:43,740
How strange.
She must be really odd.

1187
01:14:43,847 --> 01:14:46,645
No, she's very nice.

1188
01:14:46,749 --> 01:14:49,514
In fact, you know her.

1189
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:51,519
Audrey Rouget.

1190
01:14:58,061 --> 01:15:01,759
You mean, you think
you've gotten over Serena again.

1191
01:15:01,866 --> 01:15:03,834
Yes, but it's different this time.

1192
01:15:03,934 --> 01:15:08,031
Then I was still intensely involved with her,
though in a negative way. Full of bitterness.

1193
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:10,267
I don't feel that way now.

1194
01:15:10,375 --> 01:15:13,071
Charlie's on his way up.

1195
01:15:13,177 --> 01:15:15,373
Damn. There's something
I wanted to ask you.

1196
01:15:15,479 --> 01:15:18,005
Oh, yeah. What was that surprising thing
Serena told you?

1197
01:15:18,116 --> 01:15:21,985
Well, you probably already knew about it, but I was surprised
- about Audrey saving my letters.

1198
01:15:22,087 --> 01:15:25,546
- What letters?
- The ones I wrote Serena.

1199
01:15:25,658 --> 01:15:27,853
Audrey saved them?

1200
01:15:28,961 --> 01:15:30,861
God, how queer.

1201
01:15:30,963 --> 01:15:32,898
Well, it's not so queer really.

1202
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,865
Serena was about to throw them out...

1203
01:15:34,968 --> 01:15:37,765
and Audrey apparently didn't think
people's letters should be destroyed that way.

1204
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:42,570
The really odd thing was though, while I was with
Serena, who's really nice and who's so good-looking -

1205
01:15:42,676 --> 01:15:44,667
Yeah, Serena's basically a good person.

1206
01:15:44,778 --> 01:15:47,076
On the big night
I'd looked forward to for a week...

1207
01:15:47,181 --> 01:15:50,083
I started feeling this incredible loneliness
being with Serena...

1208
01:15:50,185 --> 01:15:53,312
and nostalgia for all those conversations
with Audrey before the big blowup.

1209
01:15:53,421 --> 01:15:55,651
That was before I knew anything
about the letters.

1210
01:15:55,757 --> 01:15:59,887
I think I preferred arguing with Audrey
than to agreeing with Serena or someone else.

1211
01:15:59,994 --> 01:16:04,658
I'd only had that calmly unemotional perspective
on my relationship with Serena for a little while...

1212
01:16:04,767 --> 01:16:09,170
when I started getting this warm glow at
the prospect of seeing Audrey here again tonight.

1213
01:16:09,271 --> 01:16:11,034
Uh-oh.

1214
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:15,770
It surprised me because I thought that if-
if it didn't work out with Serena this time...

1215
01:16:15,878 --> 01:16:18,780
I'd put that sort of thing
on hold for a long time.

1216
01:16:18,882 --> 01:16:21,908
People shouldn't get married till their late 20s,
and that's a long way off.

1217
01:16:22,018 --> 01:16:24,987
- Well, your timing is really awful.
- What do you mean?

1218
01:16:28,992 --> 01:16:32,292
Damn. I'll get it.
I want to continue this.

1219
01:16:38,002 --> 01:16:40,300
- Where's Jane?
- She's still in her room.

1220
01:16:40,404 --> 01:16:42,873
- What would you like to drink?
- So you're our host?

1221
01:16:42,975 --> 01:16:45,409
I don't know. What do people
who don't drink have?

1222
01:16:45,511 --> 01:16:50,312
Ginger ale? Ice water?
Ah, maybe a Coke with an aspirin.

1223
01:16:51,483 --> 01:16:54,112
You don't need to put on
pink eye shadow for us.

1224
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:56,848
It's not for you.
I've got a date.

1225
01:16:56,955 --> 01:17:00,585
A date? What's that?
It sounds like something from the 1950s.

1226
01:17:00,693 --> 01:17:02,593
Yeah. Who's the fella?

1227
01:17:02,695 --> 01:17:05,892
None of you know him,
and I'd like to keep it that way.

1228
01:17:10,270 --> 01:17:13,365
What did you mean when you said that
about my timing being off?

1229
01:17:13,474 --> 01:17:16,170
Audrey's gone to Cynthia's
in Connecticut for the weekend...

1230
01:17:16,277 --> 01:17:18,472
and then on Wednesday
she flies back to France.

1231
01:17:18,579 --> 01:17:20,571
And besides that,
she thinks you're a total jerk.

1232
01:17:20,682 --> 01:17:21,875
- She hates you.
- She hates me?

1233
01:17:21,982 --> 01:17:25,077
Well, she despises you.
Actually, it's a bit my fault.

1234
01:17:25,186 --> 01:17:27,746
I asked for that Truth question
with a specific idea in mind...

1235
01:17:27,855 --> 01:17:30,256
of showing her
you hadn't gotten over Serena yet.

1236
01:17:30,559 --> 01:17:34,586
- A Mr. Andrews is downstairs for you.
- Say I'll be right down.

1237
01:17:34,696 --> 01:17:36,926
- We'll go down with you.
- No, you won't.

1238
01:17:37,032 --> 01:17:39,433
- We can all go out together.
- No. This is a date.

1239
01:17:39,535 --> 01:17:42,003
Well, it seems rude
not to go down and check him out.

1240
01:17:42,104 --> 01:17:46,973
Please don't. Feel free to stay here.
There's plenty of food and stuff.

1241
01:17:47,077 --> 01:17:50,136
But it's all right if we stay here
and wait for everyone else?

1242
01:17:50,246 --> 01:17:52,476
Sure, but what "everyone else"?

1243
01:17:53,817 --> 01:17:56,251
Well, the rest of the S.F.R.P.

1244
01:17:56,353 --> 01:17:58,981
You are the S.F.R.P. tonight.

1245
01:17:59,089 --> 01:18:03,150
Oh, could you be out by midnight?
Feel free to stay until then though. Bye!

1246
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:05,161
- Bye.
- Bye.

1247
01:18:05,262 --> 01:18:09,324
Bye. Be out by midnight?
What's going on?

1248
01:18:09,434 --> 01:18:13,633
Jane brings this guy she hardly knows
back for some kind of assignation?

1249
01:18:13,739 --> 01:18:16,173
- We don't know that.
- Well -

1250
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:18,436
I'm really surprised at Jane.

1251
01:18:18,543 --> 01:18:21,308
Some guy asks her out,
and she abandons everything.

1252
01:18:21,413 --> 01:18:24,712
The rest of us can, well,
just go to heck.

1253
01:18:24,817 --> 01:18:27,843
The whole Rat Pack thing
seems to have disintegrated.

1254
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:30,889
The Rat Pack is down to the rats.

1255
01:18:30,991 --> 01:18:34,518
This is really depressing.
Let's get out of here.

1256
01:18:40,634 --> 01:18:43,660
I guess it's understandable that she
would prefer to go out on a date...

1257
01:18:43,771 --> 01:18:48,071
which offers some romantic promise,
even if very slight, than stay with us.

1258
01:18:48,175 --> 01:18:52,236
Still, it's a bit disappointing.
I thought we were better friends than that.

1259
01:18:52,346 --> 01:18:54,871
I wonder whether
we're really friends for them at all.

1260
01:18:54,982 --> 01:18:57,110
We're just way stations
between dates.

1261
01:18:57,219 --> 01:19:02,020
I mean, for them, men are either dates,
potential dates or date substitutes.

1262
01:19:02,124 --> 01:19:04,149
I find that dehumanizing.

1263
01:19:04,259 --> 01:19:07,490
That might be the case
with Cynthia or Sally...

1264
01:19:07,596 --> 01:19:09,791
but Audrey, for instance,
is completely different.

1265
01:19:09,898 --> 01:19:12,800
She's someone who would keep up
her friendships no matter what.

1266
01:19:12,902 --> 01:19:17,362
And Audrey has a rare largeness of mind.
She's not obsessed with her love life.

1267
01:19:17,473 --> 01:19:21,000
She's good-looking, smart...

1268
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:23,545
charming, principled.

1269
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:25,615
It's an unusual combination.

1270
01:19:31,021 --> 01:19:32,921
What do you mean?

1271
01:19:33,024 --> 01:19:36,220
You've given her nothing but grief all the past week.
- I think I'll be going now.

1272
01:19:36,326 --> 01:19:39,854
I have nothing to say,
and I'm completely boring without a drink.

1273
01:19:39,964 --> 01:19:42,431
It's only midnight.
You can't go.

1274
01:19:42,534 --> 01:19:47,028
I'm sorry, but without cocktails,
staying up all night loses its charm.

1275
01:19:47,138 --> 01:19:50,108
Besides, I haven't had anything amusing
to say since I stopped drinking.

1276
01:19:50,209 --> 01:19:53,201
Did you have anything amusing to say
before you stopped?

1277
01:19:53,312 --> 01:19:56,008
I know, but it seemed amusing.
Now it doesn't.

1278
01:19:56,115 --> 01:19:59,209
- Well, you were asleep.
- Was that it?

1279
01:19:59,318 --> 01:20:03,220
- Good night, Charlie. Ciao, Tommy.
- Ciao, Fred.

1280
01:20:04,857 --> 01:20:09,454
♪I won't be loved, baby♪

1281
01:20:09,563 --> 01:20:13,363
When I was in college, we'd go to dances
during Christmas vacations.

1282
01:20:13,467 --> 01:20:16,265
- Do they still go on?
- Yes.

1283
01:20:16,369 --> 01:20:19,134
- Pretty much reduced though.
- Yeah.

1284
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,504
Ah, well, I wouldn't put
much stock in them.

1285
01:20:21,609 --> 01:20:24,238
You go to a party, you meet a group
of people, you like them, you think...

1286
01:20:24,345 --> 01:20:27,712
"These people are going to be my friends
for the rest of my life. "

1287
01:20:27,815 --> 01:20:31,752
Then you never see them again.
I wonder where they go.

1288
01:20:31,854 --> 01:20:34,322
Do you think it's true, though,
that, generally speaking...

1289
01:20:34,423 --> 01:20:36,857
people from this sort of background
are doomed to failure?

1290
01:20:36,959 --> 01:20:39,588
Doomed?
That would, uh, be far easier.

1291
01:20:39,695 --> 01:20:43,257
No, we simply fail
without being doomed.

1292
01:20:43,366 --> 01:20:46,766
- But you feel that you have failed.
- Yeah.

1293
01:20:46,870 --> 01:20:48,929
You can still afford
to come to places like this though.

1294
01:20:49,038 --> 01:20:52,166
I'm not destitute.
I've got a good job that pays decently.

1295
01:20:52,275 --> 01:20:56,872
It's just that it's all so mediocre,
so unimpressive.

1296
01:20:56,981 --> 01:21:01,111
The acid test is whether you take any pleasure
in responding to the question...

1297
01:21:01,218 --> 01:21:03,686
"What do you do?"

1298
01:21:03,788 --> 01:21:06,484
I can't bear it.

1299
01:21:06,590 --> 01:21:11,494
You start out expecting something much more,
and some of your contemporaries achieve it.

1300
01:21:11,596 --> 01:21:14,963
You start reading about them in the papers
or seeing them on TV.

1301
01:21:15,065 --> 01:21:17,364
That's the danger
of midtown Manhattan -

1302
01:21:17,469 --> 01:21:20,700
running across
far more successful contemporaries.

1303
01:21:20,806 --> 01:21:23,900
I try to avoid them whenever I can.

1304
01:21:24,009 --> 01:21:27,707
But when I can't,
they're always very friendly...

1305
01:21:27,814 --> 01:21:31,511
but inevitably they ask,
what am I doing, or think it.

1306
01:21:31,617 --> 01:21:35,644
I - I find it hard to believe that many people
from our background are successful.

1307
01:21:35,755 --> 01:21:38,987
Aren't you confusing them with people
that you might have known from college...

1308
01:21:39,092 --> 01:21:41,322
who came from normal backgrounds?

1309
01:21:41,428 --> 01:21:46,229
It's not surprising that -
that an energetic, self-confident achiever...

1310
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:48,301
free of UHB illusions...

1311
01:21:48,402 --> 01:21:50,370
should be successful.

1312
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:52,405
- UHB? What's UHB?
- UHB.

1313
01:21:52,506 --> 01:21:56,773
U.H.B. It's an acronym
for Urban Haute Bourgeoisie.

1314
01:21:56,879 --> 01:21:59,972
It's a more sociologically precise
alternative...

1315
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:02,915
to "preppy" and other terms.

1316
01:22:03,018 --> 01:22:05,578
Well, you're partly right.

1317
01:22:05,688 --> 01:22:09,283
Some of the people whom I mentioned
were not from... UHB?

1318
01:22:09,391 --> 01:22:11,859
- That's right.
- UHB backgrounds, but some of them were.

1319
01:22:11,961 --> 01:22:15,089
You're going to have to accept
that people from our background...

1320
01:22:15,197 --> 01:22:17,928
are not doomed to failure.

1321
01:22:19,870 --> 01:22:22,998
I - I wonder if they were typical UHBs.

1322
01:22:23,106 --> 01:22:27,305
There was -There was probably
some factor which set them apart.

1323
01:22:27,411 --> 01:22:29,538
And, also, their-
their career is not over.

1324
01:22:29,647 --> 01:22:31,945
I mean, the failure
could still be to come.

1325
01:22:40,124 --> 01:22:44,083
- He seems less pessimistic than you.
- I know. It doesn't ring true.

1326
01:22:49,601 --> 01:22:51,501
Look, there's a light on.

1327
01:22:51,603 --> 01:22:53,970
We can't go up to her place
unannounced after midnight.

1328
01:22:54,073 --> 01:22:57,702
- It all depends who's on the elevator.
- It's not a question of who's on the elevator.

1329
01:22:57,810 --> 01:22:59,869
I mean, you've known Sally
for, what, 10 days?

1330
01:22:59,979 --> 01:23:02,447
And you're barging in on her uninvited
in the middle of the night?

1331
01:23:02,548 --> 01:23:06,450
She said we should come up anytime we saw the
living room lights on, which they clearly are.

1332
01:23:06,552 --> 01:23:09,078
- At least call first.
- What, and wake up her parents?

1333
01:23:09,189 --> 01:23:11,657
Well, you act as if her apartment
were our living room.

1334
01:23:11,759 --> 01:23:13,727
It is our living room.

1335
01:23:14,762 --> 01:23:16,662
Thanks, Ed.

1336
01:23:19,733 --> 01:23:23,032
- What are we doing here?
- It'll be all right.

1337
01:23:25,907 --> 01:23:29,866
- What are you doing here?
- You told us to come up if we saw the lights on.

1338
01:23:29,978 --> 01:23:33,345
- I'm sorry to bother you.
- I was just about to go out.

1339
01:23:33,449 --> 01:23:36,212
- Oh.
- Who is it?

1340
01:23:36,318 --> 01:23:39,117
Just some friends.

1341
01:23:39,221 --> 01:23:41,121
Well, come on in.

1342
01:23:45,428 --> 01:23:48,887
Allen, these are my friends,
Charlie and Tommy.

1343
01:23:48,999 --> 01:23:51,899
Allen is the record producer
who discovered The Hated Few.

1344
01:23:52,001 --> 01:23:54,562
- They're very good.
- Yes, they are.

1345
01:23:54,671 --> 01:23:58,073
And Sally will be very good.
She's got a wonderful voice.

1346
01:23:58,176 --> 01:24:01,611
I think we also have a friend in common-
Rick Von Sloneker.

1347
01:24:01,712 --> 01:24:04,238
Yeah. You're a friend of Rick's?

1348
01:24:04,349 --> 01:24:07,876
Oh, sure. Rick's a great guy. Our houses
are next to each other in Southampton.

1349
01:24:07,986 --> 01:24:10,454
Wow, it's late.
Uh, we'd better get going.

1350
01:24:10,555 --> 01:24:13,184
I don't think there's time for drinks
after all.

1351
01:24:18,596 --> 01:24:22,465
Do you have any idea when everyone's getting back?
It's as if the whole S.F.R.P. had disintegrated.

1352
01:24:22,567 --> 01:24:26,528
We can't just keep getting together with the same
people every night for the rest of our lives.

1353
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:28,539
I don't see why not.

1354
01:24:28,641 --> 01:24:31,109
It's inevitable that things
get more back to normal sometime.

1355
01:24:31,211 --> 01:24:33,406
- This wasn't normal?
- No.

1356
01:24:33,513 --> 01:24:35,640
I wish somebody
had told me that before.

1357
01:24:35,749 --> 01:24:38,217
Could you tell me, at least,
when Cynthia and Audrey are getting back?

1358
01:24:38,318 --> 01:24:40,548
I don't know. That's their affair.

1359
01:24:40,653 --> 01:24:43,053
- Your friend Cynthia's gone to that house party at Rick's.
- In Southampton?

1360
01:24:43,156 --> 01:24:45,283
- Uh-huh.
- I'm not sure if she was really going.

1361
01:24:45,393 --> 01:24:47,361
You guys are so tiresome.

1362
01:25:02,677 --> 01:25:05,407
That was really embarrassing.
Thank you for including me.

1363
01:25:05,514 --> 01:25:07,448
I can't believe it. God!

1364
01:25:07,549 --> 01:25:11,679
Maybe, underneath it all, he's a nice guy, but he
sure doesn't make a very good first impression.

1365
01:25:11,787 --> 01:25:14,450
- No, not about that. What he said about Cynthia.
- Oh.

1366
01:25:14,557 --> 01:25:17,082
Look, if Audrey's supposed to be
visiting Cynthia in Connecticut...

1367
01:25:17,193 --> 01:25:19,957
and Cynthia's in Southampton
with Von Sloneker, what does that mean?

1368
01:25:20,063 --> 01:25:22,361
That Audrey and Cynthia
are in different states.

1369
01:25:22,465 --> 01:25:24,365
No. There's only one explanation.

1370
01:25:24,467 --> 01:25:28,427
Audrey has gone with Cynthia
to Von Sloneker's house party in Southampton.

1371
01:25:28,539 --> 01:25:31,872
You know, you're always
selling Audrey awfully short, aren't you?

1372
01:25:31,975 --> 01:25:34,740
I mean, I find that - that
really despicable.

1373
01:25:34,846 --> 01:25:37,871
Could you stop calling me despicable?
I'm really worried about Audrey.

1374
01:25:37,981 --> 01:25:40,644
Jane says that since that Truth session,
she's been in a very strange mood...

1375
01:25:40,752 --> 01:25:42,720
and said some really odd things.

1376
01:25:42,821 --> 01:25:45,255
She told Jane she didn't feel
like a real woman.

1377
01:25:45,356 --> 01:25:47,756
- She said that?
- That's the way Cynthia talks.

1378
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:49,760
Yeah.

1379
01:25:49,862 --> 01:25:52,626
I can't - I can't really share
your concern.

1380
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:56,030
I mean, Audrey wouldn't put herself
in the situation you describe.

1381
01:25:56,135 --> 01:25:58,763
She's got very, very clear views
on these things.

1382
01:25:58,871 --> 01:26:01,602
I mean, you know that -
that she's a big admirer of Jane Austen.

1383
01:26:01,708 --> 01:26:05,075
- But she's turned her back on all that.
- Oh, I don't believe that.

1384
01:26:05,178 --> 01:26:07,146
She's probably at home,
asleep right now...

1385
01:26:07,247 --> 01:26:10,842
with her pink coverlet tucked up tight
and her stuffed animals looking down over her.

1386
01:26:10,951 --> 01:26:13,818
- Well, let's call her then.
- We can't.

1387
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:18,290
- It's only a local call.
- We can't call her up now. It's nearly 3:00 a. m.

1388
01:26:18,392 --> 01:26:20,519
We'd -We'd wake up her parents.

1389
01:26:20,628 --> 01:26:23,597
This is important to them too.
What if she's already at Von Sloneker's?

1390
01:26:23,698 --> 01:26:25,667
I'm sure he's not asleep.

1391
01:26:28,003 --> 01:26:31,028
Older people tend to get up really early.
I'll call the Rougets at 7:00.

1392
01:26:31,139 --> 01:26:35,577
If there's any risk of Audrey going out
to Von Sloneker's, I'll give you a call.

1393
01:26:35,677 --> 01:26:38,407
But - But I don't expect to have to.

1394
01:26:38,514 --> 01:26:40,414
Could you call me either way?

1395
01:26:40,516 --> 01:26:43,509
At 7:00? Okay.

1396
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:45,884
Thanks.
You're not such a bad fellow.

1397
01:26:45,988 --> 01:26:48,651
- I'll call you.
- Call me.

1398
01:27:00,871 --> 01:27:03,135
I hate him.

1399
01:27:05,477 --> 01:27:07,877
- Audrey Rouget?
- Uh-huh.

1400
01:27:07,979 --> 01:27:11,938
- She's getting very attractive.
- She was the first girl that ever made him feel that way.

1401
01:27:12,050 --> 01:27:14,416
She thinks you're a total jerk.
She hates you.

1402
01:27:14,519 --> 01:27:17,249
When you're an egoist,
none of the harm you do is intentional.

1403
01:27:17,355 --> 01:27:22,292
- Well, she despises you.
- Him. Victor Lemley, the other crew member.

1404
01:27:22,394 --> 01:27:26,354
- I want to be a real woman.
- You're the only girl who's ever made me feel this way.

1405
01:27:26,465 --> 01:27:29,229
I had nothing to do with that,
and, anyway, she was completely unstable.

1406
01:27:29,335 --> 01:27:31,303
I want to be a real woman.

1407
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:43,176
I called Audrey's parents
exactly at 7:00.

1408
01:27:43,284 --> 01:27:45,717
It turns out that they're
not - not such early risers.

1409
01:27:45,819 --> 01:27:49,847
But they- they thought that Audrey
was with Cynthia in Connecticut too.

1410
01:27:49,957 --> 01:27:52,825
So I called Cynthia's,
and her mother answered.

1411
01:27:52,927 --> 01:27:54,895
Apparently,
she was sleeping late also.

1412
01:27:54,996 --> 01:27:58,932
But she said that Cynthia
was visiting Audrey.

1413
01:27:59,033 --> 01:28:02,765
- Jesus!
- Well, Cynthia borrowed her mother's car.

1414
01:28:02,871 --> 01:28:05,305
And the last anyone has seen
of either of them...

1415
01:28:05,406 --> 01:28:07,375
was about 4:00 yesterday afternoon.

1416
01:28:07,476 --> 01:28:10,445
So they might have gotten
to Von Sloneker's already last night.

1417
01:28:10,546 --> 01:28:12,514
You were right.

1418
01:28:17,086 --> 01:28:19,385
But I am authorized
to use my mother's card.

1419
01:28:19,489 --> 01:28:21,923
I use it all the time.

1420
01:28:24,094 --> 01:28:26,528
- She wasn't very polite.
- No, she wasn't.

1421
01:28:28,565 --> 01:28:30,533
That should be plenty.

1422
01:28:36,173 --> 01:28:37,800
Yeah.

1423
01:28:43,849 --> 01:28:47,649
- I can't believe you don't have a license.
- Of course I don't. I live in Manhattan.

1424
01:28:47,753 --> 01:28:50,745
- I'm just really surprised, that's all.
- Oh, give me a break.

1425
01:28:50,856 --> 01:28:53,826
I don't go out to the Hamptons.
You could have gotten one easily.

1426
01:28:53,925 --> 01:28:57,053
- I'm no jock.
- God, what a disaster.

1427
01:28:57,163 --> 01:28:59,927
No, I'm -
I'm gonna get a license soon.

1428
01:29:01,301 --> 01:29:03,599
This must be how
the - the, um, failure starts -

1429
01:29:03,703 --> 01:29:07,503
an incompetence in mastering
the common tasks of everyday life.

1430
01:29:07,607 --> 01:29:10,702
- Doesn't Fred have a license?
- Yeah.

1431
01:29:10,811 --> 01:29:12,711
Okay.

1432
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:15,681
Bye.

1433
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:20,050
He says he can't.
He's about to get fired as it is.

1434
01:29:20,155 --> 01:29:22,180
He was always saying
what a lousy job it was.

1435
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:25,315
- Did you tell him how serious the situation is?
- Yes.

1436
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:30,162
He's always complaining
about what a lousy job it is.

1437
01:29:30,265 --> 01:29:33,701
You know, it's possible that, to other people,
the situation might not seem so ominous...

1438
01:29:33,802 --> 01:29:35,771
as it does to you and me.

1439
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:38,999
I- I mean, what can really happen?

1440
01:29:39,108 --> 01:29:42,077
Of course, you have been right up till now,
and Von Sloneker is a bad guy...

1441
01:29:42,178 --> 01:29:44,078
I mean, capable of anything.

1442
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:47,445
It might sound melodramatic
to say that he's ruined girls.

1443
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:50,520
I mean, what does that
really mean today?

1444
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:54,112
But it's true. I mean,
he's done some unspeakable things.

1445
01:29:54,224 --> 01:29:57,786
And if Audrey's as upset and bitter as it seems,
well, then anything could happen.

1446
01:29:58,962 --> 01:30:00,930
We gotta get out there
as fast as possible.

1447
01:30:01,031 --> 01:30:04,433
While we sit here, flailing around, anything
could be happening out at Von Sloneker's.

1448
01:30:04,534 --> 01:30:06,900
If only Nick were here.
He'd know what to do.

1449
01:30:07,003 --> 01:30:09,472
Yeah, he's got all sorts
of licenses and credit cards.

1450
01:30:09,574 --> 01:30:12,543
What would Nick do?
How would he get out of this?

1451
01:30:14,245 --> 01:30:16,976
You've got a lot of cash on you now.

1452
01:30:17,082 --> 01:30:19,243
Yes. Lots.

1453
01:30:53,554 --> 01:30:56,922
Whenever I think we might be overreacting,
I remember Polly Perkins.

1454
01:30:57,025 --> 01:31:00,825
- Or Cathy Livingstone.
- I think I knew her.

1455
01:31:02,798 --> 01:31:05,096
What are you gonna do
when we get there?

1456
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:08,227
I don't know.
It depends on what the situation is.

1457
01:31:11,373 --> 01:31:15,333
Yesterday I was thinking,
maybe Fourier was a crank...

1458
01:31:15,445 --> 01:31:17,879
his ideas completely unworkable.

1459
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:21,814
I wouldn't want to live on a farm
with a lot of other people.

1460
01:31:25,956 --> 01:31:29,392
You know, Rick's a strange guy.
He's pretty violent.

1461
01:31:31,094 --> 01:31:33,619
He might not be
too pleased to see us.

1462
01:31:33,730 --> 01:31:35,698
I've thought of that.

1463
01:32:14,342 --> 01:32:16,469
Thanks a lot.
We shouldn't be long.

1464
01:32:16,577 --> 01:32:19,774
Well, take as long as you want.
I'm leaving.

1465
01:32:19,881 --> 01:32:24,409
Oh, no. Um, we need you to take us back.
That -That was understood.

1466
01:32:24,519 --> 01:32:27,010
Think I'm gonna wait around
for you guys? You're crazy.

1467
01:32:34,129 --> 01:32:37,656
But I - I don't know how
we're going to get back.

1468
01:32:37,766 --> 01:32:39,961
What's this shit?

1469
01:32:40,068 --> 01:32:42,731
- Oh, a gratuity is included.
- What's this shit?

1470
01:32:50,613 --> 01:32:53,742
I was sure th-that we agreed
on 120 as the full price.

1471
01:33:01,057 --> 01:33:04,084
- Hey, look at this.
- What is it?

1472
01:33:04,194 --> 01:33:06,890
- Looks like some girl's panties.
- Jesus. That bastard.

1473
01:33:44,204 --> 01:33:47,435
What are you clowns doing here?

1474
01:33:47,541 --> 01:33:49,873
- What are you doing?
- This is my place.

1475
01:33:49,977 --> 01:33:52,708
- I can do whatever I want here.
- That's not true.

1476
01:33:52,814 --> 01:33:55,806
How dare you break in here?
Did they break that?

1477
01:33:55,917 --> 01:33:58,148
What are you doing here?
This is so embarrassing.

1478
01:33:58,253 --> 01:34:01,119
A little embarrassment
could do you some good.

1479
01:34:01,222 --> 01:34:03,520
And by the way, whose are these?

1480
01:34:03,625 --> 01:34:06,493
I haven't the slightest idea.
Just get out of here, you twerps!

1481
01:34:06,595 --> 01:34:11,123
- They buy them new and scatter them around. It's one of Rick's little delicacies.
- That's a lie.

1482
01:34:11,233 --> 01:34:14,066
Look, get out of here and take this flat-chested
goody-goody pain in the neck with you.

1483
01:34:14,169 --> 01:34:17,867
- Thank you.
- She is not a goody-goody.

1484
01:34:17,974 --> 01:34:20,533
Oh, oh, before you go-

1485
01:34:20,643 --> 01:34:22,839
Hey! Hey!

1486
01:34:22,946 --> 01:34:25,574
- Jesus! He's got a gun!
- What are you, crazy?

1487
01:34:25,682 --> 01:34:29,345
- I warn you, he's a Fourierist.
- It's only a joke, Rick.

1488
01:34:29,452 --> 01:34:32,650
It's a toy or an antique or something.

1489
01:34:32,757 --> 01:34:37,057
Well, then let the jerk
play his little game.

1490
01:34:49,374 --> 01:34:51,808
No, it's not that far.
It's, like, an hour.

1491
01:34:51,910 --> 01:34:54,037
Or- Or maybe two, probably.

1492
01:34:54,146 --> 01:34:56,546
Did anything happen?

1493
01:34:56,648 --> 01:34:58,548
Of course not.

1494
01:34:58,651 --> 01:35:01,745
Then you were never really interested
in Von Sloneker at all.

1495
01:35:03,856 --> 01:35:06,051
Well, then why did you
come out here?

1496
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:08,128
To get a suntan.

1497
01:35:09,228 --> 01:35:12,221
The whole thing with the Rat Pack
was getting claustrophobic.

1498
01:35:12,332 --> 01:35:15,893
And Cynthia insisted I come.
She's terribly impressed with Rick.

1499
01:35:16,003 --> 01:35:19,439
It's not something Jane Austen
would have done.

1500
01:35:19,541 --> 01:35:22,338
No.

1501
01:35:22,443 --> 01:35:25,140
I suppose Europe is over there.

1502
01:35:25,246 --> 01:35:28,010
No, that'd be more Brazil.
Europe would be more that way.

1503
01:35:29,050 --> 01:35:32,178
Are you really going back next week?

1504
01:35:32,287 --> 01:35:34,916
I guess so.

1505
01:35:35,024 --> 01:35:37,992
What can you study in France
that you can't study here?

1506
01:35:41,063 --> 01:35:43,190
French.

1507
01:35:43,299 --> 01:35:46,632
Actually, I was thinking of coming back
when the semester ends.

1508
01:35:46,736 --> 01:35:50,934
I was thinking of going over, though not
necessarily to Grenoble, but to France or Italy.

1509
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,941
Though my resources are limited.

1510
01:35:53,043 --> 01:35:56,672
There are some awfully cheap
airfares these days.

1511
01:35:56,780 --> 01:35:59,511
It would seem a shame
not to take advantage of them.

1512
01:35:59,617 --> 01:36:01,744
That's the way I feel.

1513
01:36:04,922 --> 01:36:07,550
Do you really think
I'm flat-chested?

1514
01:36:07,658 --> 01:36:10,354
Well, I never thought about it.
Well, I shouldn't say that.

1515
01:36:10,461 --> 01:36:14,192
The thing is, you look really great,
and that's what's important.

1516
01:36:14,298 --> 01:36:16,392
You don't wanna overdo it.
