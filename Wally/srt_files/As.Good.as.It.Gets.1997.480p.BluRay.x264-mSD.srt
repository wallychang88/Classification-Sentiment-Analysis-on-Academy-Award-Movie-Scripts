1
00:00:28,152 --> 00:00:32,156
I'm just going to get some flowers,
dear.

2
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:38,202
It's tulip season today and I'm so happy.

3
00:00:40,455 --> 00:00:44,542
Son of a bitch.
- Come on, sweetie.

4
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:47,587
Come on, sweetie.

5
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,595
Come on now, sweetheart.

6
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:03,727
Go for a little ride,
then you can whiz all over the city.

7
00:01:03,894 --> 00:01:07,981
Come on, go for a ride.

8
00:01:08,148 --> 00:01:10,192
No. Freeze.

9
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:13,987
Leg down. Leg down.

10
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,866
That's it. Come on.

11
00:01:21,202 --> 00:01:24,205
No. You monkey-eared son of a...

12
00:01:24,371 --> 00:01:29,126
You have pissed your last floor.

13
00:01:29,293 --> 00:01:33,964
I'll bet you wish you were a real...

14
00:01:34,131 --> 00:01:37,384
You dog-eared monkey.

15
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:44,870
This is New York. If you can make it
here you can make it anywhere.

16
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:55,443
Verdell?

17
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,570
Verdell?

18
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,450
Where's my good doggie? Verdell?

19
00:02:04,284 --> 00:02:07,246
Come here, sweetheart.

20
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:10,207
Mr. Udall?

21
00:02:12,668 --> 00:02:17,089
Have you seen Verdell?
- What does he look like?

22
00:02:19,257 --> 00:02:26,389
My dog. You know...
My dog with the adorable face.

23
00:02:26,556 --> 00:02:32,770
Don't you know what it looks like?
- You were talking about your dog.

24
00:02:32,937 --> 00:02:37,525
I thought it was that coloured man.

25
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,069
Which colour was that?

26
00:02:42,237 --> 00:02:46,491
Thick molasses with a broad nose.

27
00:02:46,658 --> 00:02:49,936
Perfect for smelling prison food.
- Frank.

28
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:54,796
You have got to get dressed.
- Frank Sachs. Melvin Udall.

29
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:59,795
Frank shows my work, Mr. Udall.
I think you know that.

30
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:04,366
As long as you keep your work
zipped up, around me, -...

31
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:07,411
I don't care where you shove your show.

32
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:12,349
Are we done being neighbours?

33
00:03:15,352 --> 00:03:20,314
Let me...
- No. Not worth it.

34
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:32,827
Hope you find him. Love that dog.
- You don't love anything.

35
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,852
One, two, three, four, five.

36
00:04:00,603 --> 00:04:03,731
One, two, three, four, five.

37
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,712
Hot. Hot, hot, hot.

38
00:04:45,312 --> 00:04:51,568
Where is he?
- He had a thing with the dog.

39
00:04:51,735 --> 00:04:54,780
Ugly dog.
- He's adorable.

40
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:02,286
My honey. Where have you been?

41
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:07,917
Look at my boy.

42
00:05:11,754 --> 00:05:15,883
I found him, Mr. Bishop.
- We know you did.

43
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,510
Where was my baby?

44
00:05:18,677 --> 00:05:26,101
ln the basement garbage bin
eating diaper shit.

45
00:05:27,018 --> 00:05:32,148
You earned your fun, John.
- It just struck me as funny.

46
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:39,321
How did he get down there?
Even if he got in the elevator...

47
00:05:39,488 --> 00:05:44,785
Maybe some nice neighbour
shoved him down the garbage chute.

48
00:05:47,287 --> 00:05:53,085
'ln the dark she had confessed
and he had forgiven.'

49
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:56,312
'This is what you live for,
he said.'

50
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,133
'Two heads on a pillow.
All is approval.'

51
00:06:00,299 --> 00:06:05,054
'There is only the safety
of being with each other.'

52
00:06:05,221 --> 00:06:10,977
'How could she find such hope
in the most shameful part of her?'

53
00:06:11,144 --> 00:06:16,733
Mr. Udall.
- 'She was able to define love.'

54
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:19,317
'Love was...'

55
00:06:19,484 --> 00:06:25,073
Mr. Udall, I'd like to speak to you.
Let me do this by myself.

56
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,703
'Love was...'
- Are you in there?

57
00:06:30,787 --> 00:06:32,998
Pansy-assed stool-pusher.

58
00:06:33,165 --> 00:06:36,084
Yes?

59
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:38,836
This can wait.

60
00:06:39,003 --> 00:06:42,965
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.

61
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,640
Well... That's a load off.

62
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:55,853
Did you... do something to him?

63
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:01,858
Do you realize that I work at home?

64
00:07:02,025 --> 00:07:07,465
Do you like being interrupted
when you're playing in your garden?

65
00:07:09,616 --> 00:07:14,037
No,
I turn the ringer off on my phone.

66
00:07:14,245 --> 00:07:18,232
And put a piece of cardboard...
- I work all the time.

67
00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:22,461
So never interrupt me.

68
00:07:22,628 --> 00:07:27,382
Not if you hear the sound of a thud
from my home, -...

69
00:07:27,549 --> 00:07:32,454
...and one week later there's a smell
from a decaying human body, -...

70
00:07:32,554 --> 00:07:38,000
...and you have to hold a hanky
to your face because of the stench.

71
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,646
Even then, don't come knocking.

72
00:07:41,854 --> 00:07:47,693
Or if it's election night
and you want to celebrate, -...

73
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,470
...because some fudge-packer was
elected the first queer president.

74
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:58,453
And he's going to have you
down to Camp David, -...

75
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,707
...and you want someone
to share the moment with.

76
00:08:02,874 --> 00:08:08,421
Even then, don't knock.
Not on this door.

77
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:12,008
Not for any reason.

78
00:08:12,175 --> 00:08:15,929
Do you get me, sweetheart?

79
00:08:17,054 --> 00:08:23,352
Yes. It's not a subtle point
that you are making.

80
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,564
Okay, then.

81
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:44,664
So, now he will think twice
before messing with me.

82
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:56,883
'Love was...'

83
00:08:58,718 --> 00:09:01,638
What was love?

84
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,851
'Love was...'

85
00:09:09,396 --> 00:09:12,649
Now I'm really pissed.

86
00:09:14,693 --> 00:09:17,278
Don't touch.

87
00:09:17,445 --> 00:09:22,241
Shut up. You don't intimidate me
with your attitude.

88
00:09:22,408 --> 00:09:26,354
I grew up in hell, homeboy.
My grandmother had more attitude.

89
00:09:26,454 --> 00:09:33,419
Police. Doughnut-munching morons.
Help me.

90
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:37,589
Assault. And you're black.

91
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:42,260
I like Simon enough
to batter you unrecognizable, -...

92
00:09:42,343 --> 00:09:47,098
...if you verbally abuse him
or touch that dog again.

93
00:09:50,018 --> 00:09:55,815
Meantime... I'll think of some way
that you can make it up to him.

94
00:09:55,982 --> 00:10:01,195
I hate doing this.
I'm an art dealer.

95
00:10:01,403 --> 00:10:03,488
Have a nice day.

96
00:10:03,655 --> 00:10:05,866
Party.

97
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:29,680
Don't touch.
- Get a life.

98
00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:34,183
Watch it.

99
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:44,970
Look at you. You're better.
- New medication.

100
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,515
You know all my son's stuff?
I've got a date tonight.

101
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:53,353
I'm walking out the door, he says,
'I promise not to get a cough.'

102
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:57,414
lsn't that sweet?
- A little blond angel.

103
00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:03,679
I said, 'You love me the way
you love your remote control.'

104
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,923
That's great.

105
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:11,136
People that talk in metaphors
ought to shampoo my crotch.

106
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:14,598
Eat up.
- I've got your money.

107
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:18,876
Pay me next week.
- I owe you and I told you today.

108
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:20,976
Excuse me, Melvin.

109
00:11:24,065 --> 00:11:26,776
There you go.

110
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:34,867
Pardon me.
Take the money.

111
00:11:35,034 --> 00:11:41,123
Take a cab home and get ready.
- Ready is not my problem.

112
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:46,461
I'm starving.
- You're not allowed back here.

113
00:11:46,628 --> 00:11:52,175
Spence is more excited about it than I am.

114
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:56,162
Sometimes, these kids,
you just want to...

115
00:11:56,262 --> 00:12:00,342
I've got jews at my table.
- It's not your table.

116
00:12:00,474 --> 00:12:03,704
You can sit at someone else's station.

117
00:12:05,354 --> 00:12:08,274
Or you can wait your turn.

118
00:12:16,698 --> 00:12:19,701
How much more have you got to eat?

119
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:27,125
Appetites aren't as big as your noses, huh?

120
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:30,086
That's it.

121
00:12:30,253 --> 00:12:32,547
Let's go.

122
00:12:32,714 --> 00:12:37,509
He's barred for life.

123
00:12:46,518 --> 00:12:51,064
They left.
- Yeah, what do you know?

124
00:12:52,816 --> 00:12:58,571
Bryan says, if you ever act like
this again you are barred for life.

125
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:01,741
I'm going to miss the excitement.

126
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:05,536
Three eggs, over easy.

127
00:13:05,745 --> 00:13:09,916
Sausage, bacon, fries.
- Fries today?

128
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:14,253
A short stack.
Coffee with cream and sweetener.

129
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,464
You'll die soon, with that diet.

130
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:23,411
We're all gonna die. You and I are,
and it sounds like your son will.

131
00:13:40,527 --> 00:13:43,781
If you ever mention my son again...

132
00:13:43,947 --> 00:13:49,217
...you will never be able to eat
here again. Do you understand?

133
00:13:54,667 --> 00:14:00,463
Give me some sign you understand,
or leave now.

134
00:14:01,464 --> 00:14:06,594
Do you understand me,
you crazy fuck?

135
00:14:11,057 --> 00:14:14,143
Do you?

136
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:22,734
Yes...

137
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:33,829
I'll get your order.

138
00:14:33,995 --> 00:14:37,123
Wear my earrings tonight.

139
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:44,679
It's just so interesting.
You said it like it was nothing.

140
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,141
Where's the bedroom?
- This is sort of it...

141
00:14:55,349 --> 00:14:58,810
I sort of sleep in here.

142
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:10,321
Don't worry about it.

143
00:15:34,386 --> 00:15:36,554
What?

144
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,433
I don't know.

145
00:15:47,523 --> 00:15:50,109
Grandma...

146
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:55,947
Maybe you better check.
- What did you think I was going to?

147
00:15:58,241 --> 00:16:03,622
I'm sorry.
I was hearing everything...

148
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:07,792
I put these on to give you privacy.

149
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:10,587
How was dinner?

150
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:17,343
How was your friend?
- Are you okay? Scootch over.

151
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:22,681
Where did he take you to eat?
- A nice place.

152
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:26,727
I have him...

153
00:16:26,894 --> 00:16:30,689
One more spit?
- He's waiting.

154
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,442
Go.

155
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:37,403
Give me a hug.
- Carol.

156
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:42,658
Carol, I have him.
- She has me. Go.

157
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,500
Close the curtains.

158
00:16:54,003 --> 00:16:57,672
No. He can't take smoke.

159
00:17:00,467 --> 00:17:02,467
Magic.

160
00:17:10,644 --> 00:17:15,940
God. That'll teach you.
I don't even notice it any more.

161
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:19,068
Come here.

162
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:34,333
It's a little bit of throw-up.
- 'Little bit of throw-up'?

163
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:39,838
What shall we do?

164
00:17:40,004 --> 00:17:43,783
Shall I write down which train
you take, or should we lay...

165
00:17:43,883 --> 00:17:46,886
No. I'll take a cab.

166
00:17:53,143 --> 00:17:58,021
It's just a little too much reality
for a Friday night.

167
00:18:02,025 --> 00:18:05,137
I promised Simon I'd find him a model.

168
00:18:05,237 --> 00:18:09,408
Take me offthe speaker.
These are house seats.

169
00:18:09,575 --> 00:18:16,581
Come on. You could use a break.
Hello? Carl? You there?

170
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:20,167
Okay. I just found a model.

171
00:18:22,211 --> 00:18:25,923
Hey, boys.
- I know this guy.

172
00:18:29,385 --> 00:18:32,388
What's going on?

173
00:18:33,806 --> 00:18:37,517
Hi. Remember?
- I only need one.

174
00:18:37,892 --> 00:18:40,937
You picked me up some time ago.

175
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:45,108
This is for a portrait.
- Portrait?

176
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:49,904
Come here.
I'll give you the address.

177
00:18:50,071 --> 00:18:54,409
Brad Pitt. It's the shit.
- Do you read?

178
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,291
Who is it, baby?

179
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,255
Who is it, Verdell?

180
00:19:10,257 --> 00:19:13,719
I'm sorry. I told you today.

181
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,846
I was out in the studio and I...

182
00:19:18,264 --> 00:19:20,041
It's out here.

183
00:19:20,141 --> 00:19:23,670
You have great things.
- Gershwin. Great, isn't he?

184
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:28,341
I make a big deal about picking
models, but Carl is so thorough.

185
00:19:28,441 --> 00:19:32,351
I bet he drove you nuts
checking your résumé.

186
00:19:35,447 --> 00:19:38,408
This is not a nude.

187
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:41,870
Just kidding around.

188
00:19:42,954 --> 00:19:44,954
So much for love.

189
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:48,792
And yet another pose.

190
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,382
What is your previous experience?
- I'm running out of ideas here.

191
00:19:57,927 --> 00:20:02,640
Give me some direction.
- I just watch.

192
00:20:02,807 --> 00:20:07,978
Until something strikes me.
Do anything you think of.

193
00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:13,692
Wait until I say to hold that pose,
then just try to hold it.

194
00:20:15,527 --> 00:20:17,527
No direction.

195
00:20:18,947 --> 00:20:23,827
What I do is, I watch.

196
00:20:25,245 --> 00:20:29,023
Ever watch somebody who doesn't
know you're watching them?

197
00:20:29,123 --> 00:20:33,795
An old woman sitting on a bus?
Or kids going to school?

198
00:20:33,962 --> 00:20:39,383
Somebody just waiting, and you see
this flash come over them.

199
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:45,055
And you know it has nothing to do
with anything external.

200
00:20:45,222 --> 00:20:50,102
They're just sort of realer and more alive.

201
00:20:51,186 --> 00:20:56,286
You look at someone long enough,
you discover their humanity.

202
00:20:58,901 --> 00:21:02,738
I know exactly what you mean.

203
00:21:08,077 --> 00:21:12,540
Oh, my God... Hold it.

204
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,958
Look out.

205
00:21:17,085 --> 00:21:19,085
Excuse me.

206
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,301
I got on the third line of dialogue.

207
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:27,429
And all of a sudden I blanked.

208
00:21:27,596 --> 00:21:29,806
Clippity-clop. lgnores me.

209
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:34,227
So he said to me, 'Last chance.'
- Last chance.

210
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:37,671
I came back in.
- Here she comes to ignore me again.

211
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:42,109
I messed up the same line.
But guess what?

212
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,110
He cast me.

213
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:50,200
Just what the world needs.
Another actress.

214
00:21:56,831 --> 00:21:59,667
Can't live without me?

215
00:22:02,003 --> 00:22:07,103
I'm finally going to ask.
What's with the plastic picnicware?

216
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,095
Are you afraid ours isn't clean?

217
00:22:11,262 --> 00:22:16,683
It's a judgment call.
- Give yourself a pep talk.

218
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:22,064
'Must try other people's
clean silverware when dining out.'

219
00:22:24,316 --> 00:22:29,154
What's wrong with your son?
- What do you care?

220
00:22:37,661 --> 00:22:41,774
He fights to breathe.
His asthma can shoot off the charts.

221
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:47,922
His immune system fails when there's
trouble, so an ear infection...

222
00:22:49,673 --> 00:22:53,344
...ls this bothering you?
- No.

223
00:22:55,136 --> 00:22:59,207
An ear infection, anything,
sends him to the emergency room, -...

224
00:22:59,307 --> 00:23:03,294
...where I get some nine-year-old
they just made a doctor.

225
00:23:03,394 --> 00:23:05,772
Nice chatting.

226
00:23:07,398 --> 00:23:10,652
His name?
- Spencer.

227
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,030
Spence.

228
00:23:23,622 --> 00:23:26,208
It's okay. Go on.

229
00:23:36,008 --> 00:23:38,302
Put on anything you want.

230
00:23:38,511 --> 00:23:43,696
I might be sort of done here.
- All we do is work. Let's play.

231
00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:04,744
So you're practically finished?
- Yeah. There is one more stage.

232
00:24:11,793 --> 00:24:16,298
Where are you going?
- No place. Just to sneak a peek.

233
00:24:27,391 --> 00:24:31,545
Verdell, you want some chocolate?
- He's not allowed.

234
00:24:31,645 --> 00:24:36,357
Wait. I got to take off.
Do you want to say goodbye?

235
00:24:36,524 --> 00:24:40,194
Yeah. He's just got to go.
- Wait.

236
00:24:40,361 --> 00:24:43,251
I'm going to look at the painting.

237
00:24:47,035 --> 00:24:49,078
Where are you going?

238
00:24:52,081 --> 00:24:55,375
Want some water?
What's the matter?

239
00:24:55,584 --> 00:24:57,669
You want some water?

240
00:25:01,173 --> 00:25:03,717
Simon, wait.

241
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,565
Why are you doing this?

242
00:25:21,108 --> 00:25:23,736
No, wait...

243
00:25:23,903 --> 00:25:27,983
That painting in there...
- Are you cruising him?

244
00:25:36,956 --> 00:25:38,233
Excuse me...

245
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:42,086
Help me.
- Come on.

246
00:25:43,838 --> 00:25:45,838
Come on.

247
00:25:57,601 --> 00:26:01,772
You call 911 and don't leave your name?

248
00:26:01,939 --> 00:26:06,760
Even a dumb geezer knows...
- Just move on. No one was killed.

249
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,987
Ask him.

250
00:26:09,863 --> 00:26:13,534
Don't bark at me.
I didn't name you.

251
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,770
We will. And if he can't,
we'll come back and ask you.

252
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:24,835
Hey. I come from hell. My grandma
has got more attitude than you.

253
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:28,657
Go shake down a 7-1 1 for a day-old wiener.

254
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:33,302
There's a painting of one of the guys.

255
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:41,643
I've been praying for him.
- I'm on my way to the hospital.

256
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:46,022
Just watch the dog for tonight.
- No, no.

257
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:49,067
I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

258
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:54,947
Old bitch. Damn dog.

259
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,953
You're taking him.

260
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,288
Get out of the way.

261
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,542
Even the books.

262
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,376
Wait.

263
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:13,632
Do you want to say no to me?

264
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,473
I don't want to say nothing to you.

265
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:29,439
Because I've never felt this crazy.
I almost want you to say no.

266
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,968
Thanks for looking after him.

267
00:27:35,068 --> 00:27:42,033
Hey. Where are you going?
- You don't want to mess with me.

268
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,205
I can't take a dog.
Nobody's been in here before.

269
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:53,420
Hey, Frank.

270
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,236
One, two, three, four...

271
00:28:40,047 --> 00:28:42,674
You're dead.

272
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:46,678
We don't have no dog food here.

273
00:28:46,845 --> 00:28:51,433
You'll eat what we got.
What we eat.

274
00:29:00,524 --> 00:29:02,985
Don't you do anything.

275
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:20,293
Where's the trust?

276
00:29:29,678 --> 00:29:33,139
Never a break.

277
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:06,919
God.

278
00:30:07,046 --> 00:30:11,951
We're halfway through the show
and we haven't sold a painting.

279
00:30:12,051 --> 00:30:15,345
No, we can't reduce the price.

280
00:30:15,512 --> 00:30:20,642
I'm in a free fall here.
- We can see him.

281
00:30:21,852 --> 00:30:25,188
I'll meet you in there, okay?

282
00:30:27,357 --> 00:30:29,357
Thank you.

283
00:30:31,987 --> 00:30:36,599
How are you doing, great one?
- I haven't looked at myself yet.

284
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:41,287
I figured I could tell from your reaction.

285
00:30:42,121 --> 00:30:46,083
That bad?
- I talked to the doctor and...

286
00:30:49,962 --> 00:30:56,009
It's not that bad. The doctors say
you'll be your old self again.

287
00:30:56,176 --> 00:31:00,722
The scars might... Oh, shit.

288
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:08,519
Jackie...

289
00:31:08,646 --> 00:31:11,774
Hand me a mirror, please.

290
00:31:19,364 --> 00:31:23,285
Wait. I have a smaller one.

291
00:31:33,294 --> 00:31:36,631
So how are things, anyway?

292
00:31:36,797 --> 00:31:42,428
How is Verdell?
- Mr. Udall... taking care of him.

293
00:31:42,637 --> 00:31:48,267
How could you? He'll hurt him.
- No, I promise.

294
00:31:48,434 --> 00:31:53,338
Not a chance. I own this guy.
Besides, there was nobody else.

295
00:31:53,438 --> 00:31:56,399
I'm always on the move and...

296
00:31:56,566 --> 00:31:59,402
Trust me.

297
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:04,324
You are certain my dog is okay?
- Yes, your dog is fine.

298
00:32:11,206 --> 00:32:14,625
Waiting gives the devil time.

299
00:32:31,141 --> 00:32:33,976
Oh, my.

300
00:32:43,778 --> 00:32:46,698
Where did I go?

301
00:32:47,824 --> 00:32:50,993
That's your dog?
- No.

302
00:32:51,953 --> 00:32:55,122
What are you doing with a dog?

303
00:32:55,455 --> 00:33:00,252
Suckered in, set up.
- You're not worried he'll be taken?

304
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:06,383
No, not until now.

305
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:10,470
Sorry.
- I'm going to sit here.

306
00:33:10,637 --> 00:33:13,097
Hey, puppy.

307
00:33:13,889 --> 00:33:17,351
It's so cute.

308
00:33:17,518 --> 00:33:20,521
I wonder what breed he is.

309
00:33:24,066 --> 00:33:29,166
He's a little dog. If Bryan's not
here, you can bring him in.

310
00:33:31,574 --> 00:33:34,242
How old are you?

311
00:33:34,409 --> 00:33:37,871
To guess by your eyes... 50.

312
00:33:38,413 --> 00:33:42,734
By your eyes, I'd say you were kind.
So much for eyes.

313
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:47,213
How old are you?
You brought it up. I'm curious.

314
00:33:47,422 --> 00:33:52,343
Not that you're ugly.
- I can take the compliment.

315
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:57,164
But my knees start knocking when
you turn on the charm full blast.

316
00:33:57,264 --> 00:34:00,893
What's with the dark?

317
00:34:03,312 --> 00:34:05,522
Dawn patrol.

318
00:34:05,689 --> 00:34:09,484
My son had a full-blown attack.

319
00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:14,989
And for extra fun
they gave us the wrong antibiotics.

320
00:34:15,156 --> 00:34:17,992
No.

321
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,288
It's bacon for the dog.

322
00:34:24,123 --> 00:34:28,444
Last week I was playing the piano
for him. And he likes it.

323
00:34:28,544 --> 00:34:35,008
So I decide I'm going to make a little joke.

324
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:48,188
It's a beautiful day for our walk.

325
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:03,786
Look at that dog.

326
00:35:03,952 --> 00:35:08,999
I've got to give you something real good.

327
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,252
I'm going to show it to you.

328
00:35:14,504 --> 00:35:17,465
Don't be like me.

329
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:23,388
Stay as you are. You're perfect.
I'll get you something to eat.

330
00:35:25,473 --> 00:35:28,643
I'd like to be treated like that.

331
00:35:29,977 --> 00:35:34,314
Let's go home and do some writing.

332
00:35:35,607 --> 00:35:40,278
'He had made the girl happy.
And what a girl.'

333
00:35:40,695 --> 00:35:44,157
'You've saved my life, she said.'

334
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:49,162
'You'd better make it up to me.'

335
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:58,003
Done.
Yes, I hate the doggie.

336
00:35:59,171 --> 00:36:02,466
62 books. Done.

337
00:36:03,217 --> 00:36:08,722
We have to cut back all expenses.
- He has no medical insurance?

338
00:36:08,889 --> 00:36:13,935
These are the food receipts,
the household expenses.

339
00:36:14,102 --> 00:36:17,856
Here's one for the dog again.
- I got it.

340
00:36:18,064 --> 00:36:21,109
And all the laundry.

341
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:30,118
Boy, look at that.
He likes it at Chez Melvin.

342
00:36:31,536 --> 00:36:36,064
What are you coming over here for?
I can't cook with a dog near me.

343
00:36:36,164 --> 00:36:42,588
Just sit. We don't want any company.
I'll read you Emerson.

344
00:36:54,223 --> 00:37:00,062
How's Verdell doing?
- He's a pain in the ass.

345
00:37:03,941 --> 00:37:10,531
Simon's home. Can you keep the dog
until he's had a chance to adjust?

346
00:37:10,698 --> 00:37:15,327
It's been weeks and weeks.
A few more won't matter.

347
00:37:15,493 --> 00:37:20,957
He wants him back right away.
He'll be by tomorrow.

348
00:37:22,792 --> 00:37:26,546
Okay.

349
00:37:32,134 --> 00:37:35,387
Hungry? Be right with you.

350
00:38:38,864 --> 00:38:40,864
Mr. Udall.

351
00:38:46,288 --> 00:38:50,709
Some face they left hanging on you.
You look like...

352
00:38:50,876 --> 00:38:54,671
Could you take it...

353
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:58,842
...just a little easy, Mr. Udall?

354
00:39:02,095 --> 00:39:04,095
Thank you.

355
00:39:06,766 --> 00:39:09,185
Verdell.

356
00:39:10,603 --> 00:39:14,773
Come here, my beautiful boy.
Come here.

357
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,360
Let's go home and get well.

358
00:39:19,486 --> 00:39:25,011
I can't blame him for being weird.
Look at yourself in the mirror.

359
00:39:28,954 --> 00:39:31,206
Thank you.

360
00:39:34,417 --> 00:39:37,378
Come on, sweetheart.

361
00:39:37,545 --> 00:39:40,923
Verdell, come here.

362
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:46,053
I know what you want.

363
00:39:49,724 --> 00:39:52,267
Where's my boy?

364
00:39:57,731 --> 00:40:01,484
No, don't force him.

365
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:37,643
Over a dog.

366
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:41,898
Over an ugly dog.

367
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:53,784
Worst sidewalk in New York.
Look where they put it.

368
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:05,253
Help.
- You'll make an appointment.

369
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:09,491
How can you diagnose someone as
an obsessive-compulsive disorder -...

370
00:41:09,591 --> 00:41:12,660
...and then act like I had a choice
about barging in?

371
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,288
You must leave.
- You said you could help me.

372
00:41:16,388 --> 00:41:21,811
What was that? A tease?
- If you take responsibility...

373
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:26,023
You changed the room around.
- Two years ago.

374
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:30,261
I also grew a beard, but you're
not interested in changes in me.

375
00:41:30,361 --> 00:41:34,431
I don't have a mountain of time.
I have to get to my restaurant.

376
00:41:34,531 --> 00:41:38,827
Do you know how hard it was for me
to come here?

377
00:41:40,203 --> 00:41:42,668
No, we're not doing this now.

378
00:41:42,747 --> 00:41:47,836
I changed just one pattern,
as you always said I should.

379
00:41:48,044 --> 00:41:50,463
No. Nope.

380
00:41:59,721 --> 00:42:04,518
What if this is as good as it gets?

381
00:42:16,279 --> 00:42:19,490
What the heck are those for?

382
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:24,537
No, no, no. Get Carol.

383
00:42:24,704 --> 00:42:30,543
I'm filling in. She might be getting
a job closer to home.

384
00:42:32,836 --> 00:42:37,215
Why plastic?
- What are you trying to do to me?

385
00:42:37,382 --> 00:42:41,469
What do you mean?
- Look, elephant girl.

386
00:42:41,636 --> 00:42:47,267
Go get Carol or something.
Just have her do my one meal here.

387
00:42:47,434 --> 00:42:50,520
I'll pay whatever you want.

388
00:42:52,855 --> 00:42:55,190
Do it.

389
00:42:57,776 --> 00:43:01,238
Bryan. Code blue.

390
00:43:06,618 --> 00:43:10,956
Out. Just shut up and get out.

391
00:43:11,706 --> 00:43:17,879
I'll be quiet.
Just let me stay here. No problem.

392
00:43:18,046 --> 00:43:22,341
Go get Carol.

393
00:43:22,884 --> 00:43:28,097
I'm not a prick.
You are. I'm not judging.

394
00:43:28,306 --> 00:43:33,393
This day has been a disaster.

395
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:37,939
I'm not sure if I can handle this.
- Get out.

396
00:43:38,982 --> 00:43:45,447
Get out immediately
or there's going to be trouble.

397
00:44:00,669 --> 00:44:02,755
See you.

398
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,217
It's about time.

399
00:44:08,052 --> 00:44:13,556
Carol's last name?
- Connelly.

400
00:44:21,272 --> 00:44:25,267
Does he visit often?
- Not really. Not any more.

401
00:45:15,573 --> 00:45:18,410
I'm hungry.

402
00:45:18,576 --> 00:45:21,897
You've ruined my whole day.
I haven't eaten.

403
00:45:21,997 --> 00:45:26,193
What are you doing here?
- This is not a sexist thing...

404
00:45:26,293 --> 00:45:29,713
Are you totally gone?
This is my home.

405
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:37,511
I'm trying to keep emotion aside,
even though it's important.

406
00:45:37,678 --> 00:45:42,641
I have strong feelings on this.
- What?

407
00:45:42,808 --> 00:45:48,772
That I wasn't there? Do you have
any control over how creepy you get?

408
00:45:54,569 --> 00:45:58,322
Yes, I do.

409
00:45:59,198 --> 00:46:04,954
And to prove it... I have not
gotten personal, and you have.

410
00:46:05,747 --> 00:46:10,084
Why aren't you at work?
Are you sick?

411
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:15,589
You don't look sick.

412
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:19,885
Just tired and bitter.

413
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:25,098
My son is sick.

414
00:46:27,601 --> 00:46:30,437
What about your mother?

415
00:46:30,978 --> 00:46:36,525
How do you know about her?
- I hear you talking while I wait.

416
00:46:36,692 --> 00:46:40,780
Mom, I finished my juice.
- One sec.

417
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:52,123
How are you doing?

418
00:46:57,837 --> 00:47:00,173
You should answer me.

419
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:05,185
Sorry, Melvin. I can't handle you
teaching my son manners.

420
00:47:08,056 --> 00:47:10,557
Back to life.

421
00:47:18,023 --> 00:47:20,817
What's wrong?

422
00:47:20,984 --> 00:47:27,282
Five one-thousand,
four one-thousand...

423
00:47:30,035 --> 00:47:34,080
...104.9.
- We're going on a cab ride.

424
00:47:36,165 --> 00:47:39,460
Look out, you guys.

425
00:47:40,586 --> 00:47:44,924
Look out.
We're okay. We're okay.

426
00:47:46,676 --> 00:47:49,220
Melvin. Wait.

427
00:47:50,221 --> 00:47:53,223
Melvin. Wait.

428
00:47:58,812 --> 00:48:02,148
Shut up, kids.

429
00:48:02,732 --> 00:48:05,860
Give us a lift, would you?

430
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:13,325
Cover your mouth when you cough.

431
00:48:15,077 --> 00:48:20,624
Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital.
- Hospital?

432
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:26,422
Any chance you'll be back today?
- No. Stay away from me.

433
00:48:30,967 --> 00:48:36,764
We can't put this off any longer.
I feel terrible that I have to...

434
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:41,561
Could you just leave the dog for a second?

435
00:48:43,354 --> 00:48:46,190
Sorry.

436
00:48:48,943 --> 00:48:54,072
What are those cards?
- Frank thought I should have notes.

437
00:48:55,073 --> 00:49:00,078
So I would maintain focus
and not terrify you.

438
00:49:00,245 --> 00:49:05,584
See? He's right.
I need the cards.

439
00:49:05,751 --> 00:49:07,751
SlMON, YOU'RE BROKE

440
00:49:14,216 --> 00:49:19,205
The medical bills are 61,000 now.
And the show didn't go well.

441
00:49:19,305 --> 00:49:24,268
I spoke to your parents.
They didn't hang up or anything.

442
00:49:24,477 --> 00:49:28,355
But they'd feel strange calling you.

443
00:49:28,522 --> 00:49:33,151
I can't call them. Come here, baby.

444
00:49:34,402 --> 00:49:36,402
Come here.

445
00:49:36,529 --> 00:49:40,450
Verdell? What's wrong?

446
00:49:40,617 --> 00:49:45,121
You miss the tough guy?
Well, here I am.

447
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:50,400
Happy to see me, you little mop?
How about a ride down the chute?

448
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,212
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

449
00:49:53,378 --> 00:49:56,131
I didn't mean that, sweetheart.

450
00:49:56,298 --> 00:49:58,298
Sorry...

451
00:49:59,468 --> 00:50:04,806
I'll be able to keep my apartment
and the studio, won't I?

452
00:50:07,476 --> 00:50:11,479
Oh, my God.

453
00:50:41,341 --> 00:50:45,787
Yes, you make us a lot of money.
But it's more appropriate...

454
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:52,768
I need this.
Just say, 'Melvin, I'll try.'

455
00:50:55,562 --> 00:50:59,483
Melvin, I'll try.
- Thank you.

456
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:06,031
My son just got accepted to Brown.
My husband was dying.

457
00:51:06,198 --> 00:51:12,078
Good, nice, thrilled, exciting.
You don't have to wait with me.

458
00:51:19,836 --> 00:51:27,385
I can't resist. I just have
so many questions I want to ask you.

459
00:51:27,552 --> 00:51:31,763
You have no idea
what your work means to me.

460
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:34,558
What does it mean to you?

461
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:39,780
That somebody out there knows
what it's like to be in here.

462
00:51:40,689 --> 00:51:43,239
God, this is like a nightmare.

463
00:51:43,817 --> 00:51:47,904
Come on.
Just a couple of questions.

464
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,578
How do you write women so well?
- I think of a man.

465
00:51:55,786 --> 00:52:00,332
And I take away reason and accountability.

466
00:52:31,778 --> 00:52:34,243
Mom.
- ln here, Mrs. Connelly.

467
00:52:34,323 --> 00:52:37,534
Please, what?
- I'm...

468
00:52:37,701 --> 00:52:40,370
Tell me.
- Dr. Bettes.

469
00:52:40,537 --> 00:52:45,459
Not your name. Where is he?
- He's in the bathroom.

470
00:52:46,001 --> 00:52:50,571
What's wrong? You know there are
doctors that come to your house?

471
00:52:50,671 --> 00:52:53,466
I'm home.

472
00:52:53,633 --> 00:52:58,223
I didn't know you had an admirer.
Oh, you met the gift.

473
00:52:59,096 --> 00:53:02,391
He's good. I'm an expert on doctors.

474
00:53:02,558 --> 00:53:05,561
Okay, doctor?

475
00:53:05,728 --> 00:53:09,439
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.

476
00:53:09,606 --> 00:53:15,053
I'm to take care of this little guy
because you are needed at work.

477
00:53:15,153 --> 00:53:19,491
What kind of work do you do?
- I'm a waitress.

478
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:23,662
ln Manhattan.
- Dr. Bettes?

479
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:26,331
Excuse me.

480
00:53:27,874 --> 00:53:32,194
I'm sorry it took so long.
- I couldn't find it, either.

481
00:53:32,294 --> 00:53:38,759
Could you get this to the lab?
I want it back today.

482
00:53:38,926 --> 00:53:45,140
Did you say 'today'?
- Yes. Let's sit down.

483
00:53:46,058 --> 00:53:51,562
These are the receipts from
all the prescriptions for the year.

484
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:57,402
The calendar.
- This is a calendar of days.

485
00:53:57,568 --> 00:54:00,697
And how he felt.
- Good.

486
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:05,602
How long has he had the problem?
- Since forever. Six months old.

487
00:54:05,702 --> 00:54:08,454
Have they done blood tests?

488
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:12,416
When he was well?
- No.

489
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,877
And how about skin testing?
- No.

490
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:19,047
No standard scratch test?
- No.

491
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:24,803
They said my plan didn't cover it.
Why? Should they have?

492
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:29,390
Fucking HMO bastard pieces of shit.

493
00:54:31,392 --> 00:54:35,062
I'm sorry.
- That's their technical name.

494
00:54:37,231 --> 00:54:43,529
Once the tests come back,
is there someone we should talk to?

495
00:54:43,696 --> 00:54:47,450
Me.
My home number is on the card.

496
00:54:48,617 --> 00:54:51,578
His home number.

497
00:54:56,666 --> 00:54:59,919
What?
- Your home...

498
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:09,261
Can we get you anything else?
- No, thank you.

499
00:55:09,428 --> 00:55:13,307
Couple of female slaves?

500
00:55:13,473 --> 00:55:18,228
There's still a lot of tests I need to do.

501
00:55:18,395 --> 00:55:22,191
Whatever I find out,
I promise you, -...

502
00:55:22,357 --> 00:55:27,457
...from now on your son is going
to feel a great deal better.

503
00:55:35,786 --> 00:55:37,997
Doc.

504
00:55:42,585 --> 00:55:46,631
That's good.

505
00:55:51,968 --> 00:55:56,164
Let me know about the costs.
One way or another we'll...

506
00:55:56,264 --> 00:56:00,226
The costs are going to be considerable.

507
00:56:00,393 --> 00:56:05,315
But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.

508
00:56:08,234 --> 00:56:10,903
That's wonderful.

509
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:17,785
Thank you for everything, Nora.

510
00:56:18,077 --> 00:56:23,347
Forgive my crankiness. I'll call
when things get back on track.

511
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:36,302
What's wrong?
- Who's going to walk Verdell?

512
00:56:38,346 --> 00:56:40,348
No.

513
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:59,199
ls he dead yet?
- No.

514
00:57:00,075 --> 00:57:06,206
Would there be any way you would
be willing to walk his dog for him?

515
00:57:06,581 --> 00:57:12,795
Absolutely.
- You're a wonderful man.

516
00:57:14,004 --> 00:57:20,261
Two o'clock would be a good time.
Here is the key in case he's asleep.

517
00:57:21,512 --> 00:57:26,809
Open his curtains for him
so he can see God's beautiful work.

518
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:32,005
And he'll know that even things
like this happen for the best.

519
00:57:32,105 --> 00:57:36,801
Did you learn to talk like this in
a 'Sailor, wanna hump-hump'-bar?

520
00:57:36,901 --> 00:57:40,301
Or is this your last shot at his whisky?

521
00:57:40,321 --> 00:57:44,741
Sell crazy someplace else.
We're all stocked up here.

522
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:58,755
No. A goofy man is behind this.
You can't block out that man.

523
00:57:58,922 --> 00:58:04,447
Do you really want to go back to
emergency, where they can't help?

524
00:58:04,636 --> 00:58:09,599
This lets a crazy man into our lives.

525
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:15,605
You know how this will turn out.

526
00:58:15,813 --> 00:58:21,338
This is not like a string of pearls.
You don't send this one back.

527
00:58:25,615 --> 00:58:27,950
Right?

528
00:58:32,996 --> 00:58:38,001
No. I do, I understand.
Listen. I have to go, okay?

529
00:58:38,918 --> 00:58:42,839
FRlENDS TO ASK FOR MONEY

530
00:58:43,506 --> 00:58:45,634
Bye.

531
00:58:46,259 --> 00:58:48,259
Bye-bye.

532
00:58:52,139 --> 00:58:54,391
What a day...

533
00:58:54,767 --> 00:58:57,853
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

534
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:00,773
Thank you for walking him.

535
00:59:02,691 --> 00:59:08,155
Excuse me, I'm not feeling well.
- This place smells like shit.

536
00:59:08,322 --> 00:59:10,490
Go away.

537
00:59:10,782 --> 00:59:16,120
This cleaning lady doesn't..?
- Please, just leave.

538
00:59:17,705 --> 00:59:22,668
What happened to your friends?
- Get out of here.

539
00:59:28,049 --> 00:59:32,828
There's nothing worse than having
to feel this way in front of you.

540
00:59:32,928 --> 00:59:37,682
Nellie.
Your a disgrace to depression.

541
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:44,689
Rot in hell, Melvin.
- No need to stop being a lady.

542
00:59:44,898 --> 00:59:48,298
You'll be back on your knees in no time.

543
00:59:56,784 --> 01:00:00,037
ls this fun for you?

544
01:00:00,538 --> 01:00:06,585
It keeps getting better and better.
I'm losing my apartment, Melvin.

545
01:00:06,752 --> 01:00:12,277
Frank wants me to beg my parents,
who haven't called me, for help.

546
01:00:12,549 --> 01:00:14,549
And I won't.

547
01:00:14,592 --> 01:00:17,887
I don't want to paint any more.

548
01:00:18,263 --> 01:00:21,558
The life I was trying for, is over.

549
01:00:21,766 --> 01:00:27,564
The life I had is gone
and I'm feeling sorry for myself.

550
01:00:28,106 --> 01:00:33,631
It's high times for you, isn't it?
The gay neighbour is terrified.

551
01:00:34,194 --> 01:00:36,613
Terrified.

552
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:52,295
I was trying to give you a boost.

553
01:00:52,461 --> 01:00:57,216
Lucky you.
You're here for rock bottom.

554
01:00:57,383 --> 01:01:01,762
You absolute horror of a human being.

555
01:01:14,441 --> 01:01:19,446
The one thing I'll do for you
might cheer you up.

556
01:01:19,654 --> 01:01:22,115
Get out.

557
01:01:22,449 --> 01:01:26,478
You want to know why the dog
prefers me? It's not affection.

558
01:01:26,578 --> 01:01:29,246
It's a trick.

559
01:01:31,248 --> 01:01:34,543
I keep bacon in my pocket.

560
01:01:35,085 --> 01:01:37,296
See?

561
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:48,931
We'll both call him. You'll see.
It's a trick.

562
01:01:57,273 --> 01:02:00,651
Come here, Verdell.

563
01:02:05,448 --> 01:02:07,991
Come on.

564
01:02:08,366 --> 01:02:10,368
Come here.

565
01:02:15,624 --> 01:02:19,544
Just a stupid dog.

566
01:02:22,756 --> 01:02:26,843
Could you leave now? Please?

567
01:02:28,928 --> 01:02:32,473
I don't get it.

568
01:04:08,856 --> 01:04:10,856
Mr. Udall.

569
01:04:12,651 --> 01:04:16,113
Carol the waitress?
- Yes.

570
01:04:25,914 --> 01:04:30,844
The doctors gave me your address.
I'm sorry about the hour.

571
01:04:36,174 --> 01:04:39,177
If you...

572
01:04:41,763 --> 01:04:48,810
If it's about thanking me...
- That's not why I'm here.

573
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:54,232
Though it's nice to talk to
a real doctor about Spencer.

574
01:04:56,860 --> 01:05:00,989
Note. Put it in a note.

575
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:15,002
I have a hairdryer.
- Why did you do this for me?

576
01:05:19,173 --> 01:05:24,428
So you'd come back to work.
- That sounds strange.

577
01:05:27,722 --> 01:05:31,309
I'm worried you did this...

578
01:05:46,449 --> 01:05:51,370
Are you waiting for me to say something?

579
01:05:53,747 --> 01:05:56,333
Look...

580
01:05:58,001 --> 01:06:03,549
I'll be there tomorrow.
- I need to clear this up now.

581
01:06:04,967 --> 01:06:07,760
Clear what up?

582
01:06:09,136 --> 01:06:14,392
I'm not going to sleep with you.
I will never sleep with you.

583
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,937
Not ever.

584
01:06:22,441 --> 01:06:26,779
I'm sorry, but...

585
01:06:28,655 --> 01:06:34,160
...we don't open
for the no-sex oaths until 9 a.m.

586
01:06:35,078 --> 01:06:41,167
I'm not kidding.
- Anything else?

587
01:06:42,794 --> 01:06:47,715
Just... thank you.

588
01:06:53,137 --> 01:06:56,265
So you will be at work tomorrow?

589
01:06:58,809 --> 01:07:01,270
Yes.

590
01:07:16,034 --> 01:07:19,454
'Never', she said.

591
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:41,641
I took a chance you were up.

592
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:45,312
I brought you some Chinese soup.

593
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:49,690
Thanks.

594
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:09,876
I've never been this tired in my life.

595
01:08:16,633 --> 01:08:20,178
I haven't been sleeping.

596
01:08:21,471 --> 01:08:26,810
I haven't been clear in my head
or felt like myself.

597
01:08:29,645 --> 01:08:32,272
I'm in trouble.

598
01:08:32,731 --> 01:08:35,526
It's not just the tiredness.

599
01:08:36,026 --> 01:08:41,281
Sick. Nauseous.
- Sleepy.

600
01:08:41,448 --> 01:08:47,703
Everything looks distorted
and everything inside aches.

601
01:08:47,912 --> 01:08:51,707
You can barely find the will to complain.

602
01:08:55,753 --> 01:08:59,340
I'm glad we did this.

603
01:09:00,091 --> 01:09:03,261
Good talking to you.

604
01:09:10,976 --> 01:09:17,315
Still writing that thank-you note?
- How do you spell 'conscience'?

605
01:09:17,482 --> 01:09:20,819
C-O-N-S-C-I-E-N-C-E.

606
01:09:20,986 --> 01:09:26,241
Look, I got Sean to babysit
so we could go out.

607
01:09:26,408 --> 01:09:30,318
I don't feel safe
leaving Spencer with someone.

608
01:09:30,411 --> 01:09:35,936
Spencer's okay. Start finding
something to do with your free time.

609
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:40,212
Sean, are you hungry?

610
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:47,427
We got pizza. Sausage, pepperoni.
You want to make this later?

611
01:09:49,178 --> 01:09:52,765
We are going out, like people do.

612
01:09:54,726 --> 01:10:01,107
If you can't feel good about
this break and step out a little, -...

613
01:10:01,274 --> 01:10:06,429
...then you ought to have Mr. Udall
send you over a psychiatrist.

614
01:10:06,529 --> 01:10:10,354
I don't need one.
I know what's going on here.

615
01:10:12,659 --> 01:10:18,707
I must finish this letter first.
This can't be right? Con-science?

616
01:10:19,332 --> 01:10:21,626
Carol.

617
01:10:25,881 --> 01:10:28,883
What?

618
01:10:43,856 --> 01:10:46,983
It's very weird not feeling that...

619
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:51,988
...stupid panic thing inside me.

620
01:10:52,697 --> 01:10:56,493
Without that,
I start thinking about myself.

621
01:10:56,701 --> 01:11:00,121
And what good
does that ever get anybody?

622
01:11:02,832 --> 01:11:06,443
Today on the bus
there was this adorable couple.

623
01:11:06,543 --> 01:11:09,338
And I felt myself...

624
01:11:10,672 --> 01:11:14,301
...giving them a dirty look.

625
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:20,849
I just had no idea.
Everything was...

626
01:11:27,772 --> 01:11:30,441
Go ahead.

627
01:11:31,609 --> 01:11:35,029
Moving in the wrong direction.

628
01:11:35,738 --> 01:11:42,161
Away from a time when I remembered
what it was like to have a man...

629
01:11:42,328 --> 01:11:44,705
...to hold fucking...

630
01:11:48,917 --> 01:11:52,754
...hands with.

631
01:11:54,506 --> 01:12:00,720
I felt almost really bad
that Dr. Bettes is married.

632
01:12:04,266 --> 01:12:09,706
Which is probably why I make Spence
hug me more than he wants to.

633
01:12:11,230 --> 01:12:16,235
He has to make up for
his Mom not getting any.

634
01:12:20,531 --> 01:12:26,327
Who needs these thoughts?
- So, are you frustrated?

635
01:12:26,494 --> 01:12:31,582
Leave me be.
What is it you want?

636
01:12:31,749 --> 01:12:38,089
Does getting me thinking about all
that's wrong have some purpose?

637
01:12:39,465 --> 01:12:43,219
Really, Mom, what is it you want?

638
01:12:43,594 --> 01:12:48,098
What?
- I want us to go out.

639
01:13:17,376 --> 01:13:22,339
Thank you.
- I'll send you a thank-you note.

640
01:13:29,012 --> 01:13:31,723
That's why you brought me here?

641
01:13:31,890 --> 01:13:37,520
Well, it's not even mine.
Simon has enough on his mind.

642
01:13:37,687 --> 01:13:41,691
But the dog did throw up twice last night.

643
01:13:41,858 --> 01:13:47,237
Take him to the vet.
- I did. His stomach's out of whack.

644
01:13:47,404 --> 01:13:51,399
They need him a couple of days.
- Well, do it...

645
01:13:51,867 --> 01:13:53,911
Sorry.

646
01:13:54,203 --> 01:13:59,082
This is for later.
- What's this?

647
01:14:00,167 --> 01:14:04,004
It's a note.
- A note?

648
01:14:04,213 --> 01:14:07,715
A thank-you note.
- No thank you.

649
01:14:07,882 --> 01:14:12,637
You can read it later.
- No thank-you note. No, no.

650
01:14:15,556 --> 01:14:18,684
Thank you.

651
01:14:24,232 --> 01:14:30,946
She's nice.
- Yeah, really nice.

652
01:14:33,323 --> 01:14:38,423
Shouldn't that be a good thing,
saying, 'No thanks required'?

653
01:14:39,996 --> 01:14:43,875
Sure looks like it went over, too.

654
01:14:45,001 --> 01:14:48,545
Look at you.

655
01:14:48,754 --> 01:14:54,051
You're making the rounds.
Simon says you brought him soup.

656
01:14:58,347 --> 01:15:01,892
What?
- You think I'm a mark...

657
01:15:02,101 --> 01:15:07,171
You helped with the dog. I'm as
concerned about Simon as you are.

658
01:15:07,271 --> 01:15:10,416
Concerned?
- He needs more than money.

659
01:15:10,441 --> 01:15:15,305
He must go to Baltimore to ask
his parents for money tomorrow.

660
01:15:15,405 --> 01:15:19,242
They have to help. It's the rules.

661
01:15:19,409 --> 01:15:23,121
That's great. Let them help him.

662
01:15:24,914 --> 01:15:26,998
Only...

663
01:15:27,165 --> 01:15:32,546
...I got a painter coming through,
so I'm out.

664
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:38,260
Can you drive him?
- Think white and get serious.

665
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:43,390
Take my car? A convertible.

666
01:15:44,808 --> 01:15:48,769
Do you drive?
- Yes. But I'm not doing it.

667
01:15:48,936 --> 01:15:51,772
Getting loud.

668
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:58,571
He wants me to take his car...
- I want your problems.

669
01:15:58,737 --> 01:16:04,177
Somebody offers me a convertible
so I can get out of this city...

670
01:16:09,706 --> 01:16:13,960
Go ahead, girl.
- Okay. I'll do it.

671
01:16:14,127 --> 01:16:19,674
I'll take him. Get him packed.
Tomorrow morning I'll take him.

672
01:16:24,512 --> 01:16:29,933
I'll see you tomorrow.
Let's not drag this out.

673
01:16:35,105 --> 01:16:40,715
If there's some health foundation
for people like you, let me know.

674
01:16:41,069 --> 01:16:45,656
Last-word freak.
- Good luck, lady.

675
01:16:46,866 --> 01:16:50,202
Anything else?
- Yeah.

676
01:16:52,371 --> 01:16:57,131
I'm going to give my queer neighbour
a lift to Baltimore.

677
01:17:00,671 --> 01:17:05,884
What I did for you...
It's working out?

678
01:17:08,303 --> 01:17:12,015
What you did changed my life.

679
01:17:12,891 --> 01:17:15,101
No.

680
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:18,188
No thank-you note.

681
01:17:18,396 --> 01:17:23,751
Well, part of what I said in this
entire history of my life -...

682
01:17:24,069 --> 01:17:29,365
...is that you have done more
for my mother, my son...

683
01:17:29,573 --> 01:17:33,202
...and me than anybody else ever has.

684
01:17:33,369 --> 01:17:37,194
I'm just going to read you this part of it...

685
01:17:37,873 --> 01:17:43,754
'That makes you the most generous
person I ever met in my life.'

686
01:17:43,921 --> 01:17:48,549
'And you're going to be
in our daily prayers, forever.'

687
01:17:49,967 --> 01:17:52,053
Lovely.

688
01:17:53,221 --> 01:17:57,600
I also wrote one part...
I wrote that I was sorry.

689
01:17:59,686 --> 01:18:04,173
I was talking about how I was sorry
when I got mad at you -...

690
01:18:04,273 --> 01:18:08,510
...when you told my son
that he ought to answer back.

691
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:15,158
I wrote that I was sorry about that.
I'm sorry for that night...

692
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:19,830
...when I said that I was never...

693
01:18:19,996 --> 01:18:25,584
I'm sorry for every time your food
was cold and you had to wait.

694
01:18:25,918 --> 01:18:32,716
And I'm sorry for never spotting the
human being that did this for us.

695
01:18:34,885 --> 01:18:38,097
I'll just start from the beginning.

696
01:18:38,305 --> 01:18:41,917
'I have not been able to express
my gratefulness to you.'

697
01:18:42,017 --> 01:18:47,605
'The word grateful doesn't begin
to tell you what I feel.'

698
01:18:51,317 --> 01:18:55,321
That's nice of you. Thank you.

699
01:18:58,241 --> 01:19:01,119
Thank you.

700
01:19:09,668 --> 01:19:13,380
Now I want you to do something for me.

701
01:19:20,345 --> 01:19:25,308
I'm sorry. Didn't I say 'what'?
I thought I did.

702
01:19:28,895 --> 01:19:33,232
What?
- I want you to go on this trip.

703
01:19:33,399 --> 01:19:36,986
No, sir.
- I can't do this without you.

704
01:19:37,194 --> 01:19:44,493
He might pull the stiff one-eye
on me. I need you to chaperone.

705
01:19:44,702 --> 01:19:51,166
You said you liked convertibles.
Now I'm on the hook. Two days.

706
01:19:51,333 --> 01:19:57,088
I can't. My son.
- Bettes said he's doing fine.

707
01:19:58,006 --> 01:20:05,262
Melvin, I'd rather not.
- Write a note. Ain't she sweet?

708
01:20:05,429 --> 01:20:11,518
I need a hand and where is she?
- Your help obligates me?

709
01:20:12,227 --> 01:20:16,440
ls there any other way to see it?

710
01:20:18,067 --> 01:20:20,361
No.

711
01:20:25,073 --> 01:20:30,536
Here's a little suitcase.
Shocked that it's being used.

712
01:20:39,462 --> 01:20:42,607
There's no way to pack for this trip.

713
01:21:06,112 --> 01:21:09,657
You're still coming, aren't you?
- Yes.

714
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:15,079
Melvin, exactly where are we going?

715
01:21:15,246 --> 01:21:19,734
Just south of Baltimore.
I know what you're going to say.

716
01:21:19,834 --> 01:21:23,087
I mean... I think I know.

717
01:21:23,921 --> 01:21:30,426
I'm not sure, but I think so.
- Should I bring something dressy?

718
01:21:32,887 --> 01:21:37,477
Will we be eating in restaurants
that have dress codes?

719
01:21:41,813 --> 01:21:43,815
Maybe...

720
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:49,111
Yes. Let's... Let's.
- Okay.

721
01:21:52,197 --> 01:21:56,226
What did you think I'd ask?
- Whether crabs were in season now.

722
01:21:56,326 --> 01:22:00,622
Okay, then. Goodnight.

723
01:22:05,835 --> 01:22:10,131
Anything unusual in his diet?
- No.

724
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:16,637
Everybody gets their own cage?
Put him in with that one.

725
01:22:18,222 --> 01:22:20,222
Lip kiss.

726
01:22:23,019 --> 01:22:28,523
I love you. I'll miss you...
Real sensitive.

727
01:22:29,482 --> 01:22:33,737
Bye.
- Call when you're settled.

728
01:22:41,411 --> 01:22:45,748
Have a good time.
- Don't run.

729
01:22:46,206 --> 01:22:50,961
Have fun, but don't run.

730
01:22:55,049 --> 01:22:58,619
I'm sorry I'm not taking you.
- So am I, Frank.

731
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:01,513
Give me a hug.

732
01:23:02,556 --> 01:23:05,183
Everything's going to be okay.

733
01:23:05,391 --> 01:23:11,064
Soak it up. It's your last chance
for a hug for a few days.

734
01:23:16,778 --> 01:23:19,280
Hello.

735
01:23:26,453 --> 01:23:29,915
Thank you for being on time.

736
01:23:31,792 --> 01:23:37,214
Carol the waitress. Simon the fag.

737
01:23:40,926 --> 01:23:44,595
Holy God. Who did that to you?

738
01:23:45,137 --> 01:23:50,267
I was attacked.
I walked in on some men robbing me.

739
01:23:50,434 --> 01:23:54,188
And I was hospitalized.

740
01:23:55,314 --> 01:24:00,277
I almost died.
- Let's do the small talk later.

741
01:24:04,156 --> 01:24:07,225
I was going to do that.
- Where should we sit?

742
01:24:07,325 --> 01:24:12,247
There's no place cards.
- You need room.

743
01:24:13,706 --> 01:24:16,417
So I'll sit in the back.

744
01:24:30,305 --> 01:24:33,267
Never a break. Never.

745
01:24:34,059 --> 01:24:36,979
Thank you. It was very thoughtful.

746
01:24:37,813 --> 01:24:41,859
You look like you're crowded.
- It's all right.

747
01:24:44,610 --> 01:24:46,610
Thanks.

748
01:24:54,662 --> 01:24:56,662
Thank you.

749
01:24:57,999 --> 01:25:00,001
You're welcome.

750
01:25:03,713 --> 01:25:07,382
I've got the whole trip programmed.

751
01:25:10,885 --> 01:25:15,473
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

752
01:25:16,683 --> 01:25:19,644
TO USE AS lCEBREAKER

753
01:25:19,853 --> 01:25:22,814
We've got good stuff here.

754
01:25:37,995 --> 01:25:40,664
I like this music.

755
01:25:42,624 --> 01:25:45,668
I like this music.

756
01:25:59,390 --> 01:26:03,227
I'm sure they did something really off.

757
01:26:03,394 --> 01:26:10,525
But something will always be off
for you, unless you set it straight.

758
01:26:11,401 --> 01:26:16,181
And maybe this thing happened to you
to give you a chance to do that.

759
01:26:16,281 --> 01:26:19,117
Nonsense. You want to know why?

760
01:26:19,284 --> 01:26:24,469
Anyone interested in what Melvin
has to say, raise their hand.

761
01:26:31,921 --> 01:26:36,258
Want to know
what happened with my parents?

762
01:26:37,593 --> 01:26:42,264
When I was...
- Wait. I'm going to pull over.

763
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:51,064
I always painted.
And my mom always encouraged me.

764
01:26:51,231 --> 01:26:55,235
She was sort of fabulous about it.

765
01:26:55,610 --> 01:27:01,574
She... I was too young to think
there was anything wrong with it.

766
01:27:01,741 --> 01:27:05,077
And she was very natural.

767
01:27:05,285 --> 01:27:08,789
So she used to pose nude for me.

768
01:27:08,956 --> 01:27:13,752
I always thought
that my father knew about it.

769
01:27:13,961 --> 01:27:17,673
This stuff is pointless.
- Let him finish.

770
01:27:17,839 --> 01:27:21,843
Do you want to hear my sad story?
- Stop.

771
01:27:23,761 --> 01:27:28,432
Go ahead. Don't let him stop you.

772
01:27:29,308 --> 01:27:34,564
One day he walked in and found us.
And he started screaming.

773
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:38,009
My father didn't come out for 1 1 years.

774
01:27:38,109 --> 01:27:43,804
He used to hit me with a yardstick
if I made a mistake on the piano.

775
01:27:47,659 --> 01:27:53,039
Go ahead, Simon.
So he came in and he was yelling?

776
01:27:53,206 --> 01:27:55,458
Please, come on.

777
01:27:56,793 --> 01:27:59,629
He was...

778
01:27:59,963 --> 01:28:04,717
I was defending my mother.

779
01:28:05,092 --> 01:28:11,432
I was trying to make peace
in the lamest way.

780
01:28:11,598 --> 01:28:16,520
I said,
'She's not naked. It's art.'

781
01:28:19,773 --> 01:28:22,943
And he started hitting me.

782
01:28:23,110 --> 01:28:26,612
He beat me unconscious.

783
01:28:27,155 --> 01:28:33,327
And he talked to me less and less.
He knew what I was before I did.

784
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:38,833
The morning I left for college
he walked into my room.

785
01:28:39,042 --> 01:28:45,088
He held out his hand.
And it was filled with money.

786
01:28:45,881 --> 01:28:51,720
A big sweaty wad of money.

787
01:28:52,596 --> 01:28:57,851
And he said, 'I don't want you
to ever come back.'

788
01:28:58,018 --> 01:29:02,022
I just grabbed him and I hugged him.

789
01:29:02,230 --> 01:29:05,983
And he turned and walked out.

790
01:29:15,910 --> 01:29:21,624
We all have these stories.
- It's not true.

791
01:29:21,916 --> 01:29:24,709
Some of us have great stories.

792
01:29:24,918 --> 01:29:30,840
That take place at lakes with boats
and friends and noodle salad.

793
01:29:31,007 --> 01:29:36,012
No one here. But a lot of people.
That's their story...

794
01:29:36,179 --> 01:29:41,810
Good times, noodle salad.
It's not that you had it bad, -...

795
01:29:41,976 --> 01:29:46,672
...but that you're that pissed
that so many others had it good.

796
01:29:46,772 --> 01:29:51,610
No. I don't think so.
- Not it at all, really.

797
01:29:52,444 --> 01:29:54,696
Not it at all?

798
01:29:55,280 --> 01:30:00,536
Let's go to the hotel.

799
01:30:00,702 --> 01:30:06,567
You'll see if you can get another
wad of sweaty money out of his hand.

800
01:30:15,758 --> 01:30:18,803
Can I ask you a personal question?

801
01:30:21,222 --> 01:30:24,349
Sure.

802
01:30:24,516 --> 01:30:28,687
You ever get an erection over a woman?

803
01:30:30,105 --> 01:30:36,319
Wouldn't your life be easier..?
- You consider your life easy?

804
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:42,158
I give you that one.

805
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:47,454
Nice packing.

806
01:30:55,504 --> 01:30:59,967
Hey, Spence.
- Hey, Mom. Wait till you hear...

807
01:31:00,175 --> 01:31:04,470
Why are you out of breath?
- Mom, lscored a goal.

808
01:31:04,637 --> 01:31:08,641
You did?
- Yep. He was big. Charlie.

809
01:31:08,850 --> 01:31:13,312
That's great.
Oh my God.

810
01:31:14,105 --> 01:31:17,900
We're playing again. Got to go.
- Wait...

811
01:31:20,528 --> 01:31:24,865
He scored a goal.
- I don't believe it.

812
01:31:25,073 --> 01:31:27,159
You would have died.

813
01:31:28,910 --> 01:31:33,039
My son was outside playing soccer.

814
01:31:33,206 --> 01:31:38,295
Take me out dancing.
- Dancing?

815
01:31:40,046 --> 01:31:45,009
I can't. I'm exhausted.
- Oh, come on.

816
01:31:45,217 --> 01:31:47,428
No.

817
01:31:47,595 --> 01:31:51,140
All right.

818
01:31:51,599 --> 01:31:56,353
Are you sad or something?
- No. I'm nervous.

819
01:31:56,562 --> 01:32:02,735
It would be very rough, Carol,
if you weren't along.

820
01:32:15,371 --> 01:32:20,168
I'm happy.
And you're my date.

821
01:32:22,337 --> 01:32:25,547
Let's get dressed.

822
01:32:32,804 --> 01:32:38,393
I'm going to jump in the shower.
I'll be right with you.

823
01:33:15,637 --> 01:33:18,265
All set?

824
01:33:22,810 --> 01:33:25,296
Do you sell hard-shell crabs?
- Yes.

825
01:33:25,396 --> 01:33:28,482
Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

826
01:33:36,323 --> 01:33:39,243
Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

827
01:33:44,038 --> 01:33:46,038
Good evening.

828
01:33:46,165 --> 01:33:49,193
You have hard-shells, right?
- Stop asking.

829
01:33:49,293 --> 01:33:53,089
You can answer.
- Yes, we do.

830
01:33:54,006 --> 01:33:57,321
I can give you a tie and jacket.
- What?

831
01:33:57,385 --> 01:34:00,680
They require a tie and jacket.

832
01:34:14,609 --> 01:34:21,491
No. I'm not putting that on. And I
won't let you inject me with plague.

833
01:34:21,658 --> 01:34:26,928
It's a nice place. You dry-clean
these all the time, don't you?

834
01:34:27,079 --> 01:34:30,082
I don't think so.

835
01:34:40,092 --> 01:34:43,344
You just wait here.

836
01:34:55,273 --> 01:34:57,273
Good evening.

837
01:34:58,902 --> 01:35:03,030
I need a coat and tie.
- Come on in.

838
01:35:05,490 --> 01:35:09,453
No?
- That one.

839
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:12,247
And this tie.

840
01:35:21,548 --> 01:35:23,548
Excuse me.

841
01:35:27,178 --> 01:35:31,891
She's here.
We saved a table for you.

842
01:35:32,642 --> 01:35:38,397
Should I get her for you?
- No. I'll just watch.

843
01:36:22,647 --> 01:36:24,857
Ma'am...

844
01:37:04,186 --> 01:37:06,605
You look so se...

845
01:37:09,108 --> 01:37:12,278
You look great.

846
01:37:13,529 --> 01:37:15,656
You look great.

847
01:37:25,999 --> 01:37:28,668
You want to dance?

848
01:37:28,835 --> 01:37:33,031
I've been thinking about that
since you brought it up before.

849
01:37:33,131 --> 01:37:35,175
No.

850
01:37:37,719 --> 01:37:40,096
I don't get this place.

851
01:37:40,263 --> 01:37:46,727
They make me buy a new outfit
and let you in in a housedress.

852
01:37:47,895 --> 01:37:53,233
What? Wait.
Where are you going? Why?

853
01:37:56,278 --> 01:38:00,157
I didn't mean it that way. Sit down.

854
01:38:00,324 --> 01:38:05,536
Give me the dirty look.
- Pay me a compliment, Melvin.

855
01:38:05,870 --> 01:38:08,706
I need one. Quick.

856
01:38:08,915 --> 01:38:12,877
What you just said hurt my feelings.

857
01:38:13,085 --> 01:38:17,949
The minute someone gets that they
need you they threaten to walk out.

858
01:38:18,049 --> 01:38:22,636
A compliment is
something nice about somebody else.

859
01:38:22,928 --> 01:38:25,430
Now or never.

860
01:38:35,815 --> 01:38:38,944
And mean it.

861
01:38:49,286 --> 01:38:52,331
Can we order first?

862
01:38:58,253 --> 01:39:02,590
Two hard-shell crab dinners...
Pitcher of cold beer.

863
01:39:02,757 --> 01:39:07,095
Baked or fries?
- Fries.

864
01:39:08,554 --> 01:39:12,100
Fries.
- One baked, one fried.

865
01:39:12,266 --> 01:39:16,562
I'll tell your waiter.

866
01:39:17,522 --> 01:39:24,361
I've got a great compliment for you.
And it's true.

867
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:31,868
I'm afraid it's something awful.
- Don't be pessimistic.

868
01:39:32,035 --> 01:39:38,500
Okay. Here I go.
Clearly a mistake.

869
01:39:40,043 --> 01:39:44,421
I've got this... ailment.

870
01:39:48,551 --> 01:39:52,304
My doctor,
a shrink I used to go to, -...

871
01:39:52,513 --> 01:39:58,310
...says that in 50 or 60 percent
of the cases a pill really helps.

872
01:39:58,978 --> 01:40:02,230
I hate pills. Very dangerous thing.

873
01:40:02,397 --> 01:40:07,235
I'm using the word 'hate' here about pills.

874
01:40:07,402 --> 01:40:13,437
My compliment is, the night you came
over and told me you would never...

875
01:40:15,368 --> 01:40:19,372
All right, you know what you said.

876
01:40:19,706 --> 01:40:22,875
My compliment to you is, -...

877
01:40:23,375 --> 01:40:28,213
...the next morning I started taking the pills.

878
01:40:31,717 --> 01:40:35,304
How is that a compliment for me?

879
01:40:40,058 --> 01:40:45,187
You make me want to be a better man.

880
01:40:55,489 --> 01:40:59,660
That's maybe
the best compliment of my life.

881
01:41:03,955 --> 01:41:09,878
Maybe I overshot a bit
to keep you from walking out.

882
01:41:21,555 --> 01:41:27,227
How's it going with those pills?
Good, I hope, I hope, I hope.

883
01:41:33,067 --> 01:41:36,403
It's little by little.

884
01:41:37,071 --> 01:41:42,241
It's exhausting talking like this.
Exhausting.

885
01:42:01,384 --> 01:42:06,373
Do you ever let a romantic moment
make you do something stupid?

886
01:42:06,473 --> 01:42:08,558
Never.

887
01:42:09,017 --> 01:42:12,270
Here's the trouble with never.

888
01:42:33,707 --> 01:42:38,963
You don't owe me that.
- That wasn't payment.

889
01:42:39,380 --> 01:42:44,926
When I first saw you
I thought you were handsome.

890
01:42:46,136 --> 01:42:49,347
Then, of course, you spoke.

891
01:42:51,099 --> 01:42:57,355
So now that your...
soft underbelly is all exposed...

892
01:42:58,273 --> 01:43:02,651
Tell me,
why did you bring me here?

893
01:43:05,028 --> 01:43:07,028
Well, I...

894
01:43:11,869 --> 01:43:17,207
That's a personal question.
- Tell me, even if you're scared.

895
01:43:17,374 --> 01:43:21,294
Scared?
- Tell me why you wanted me here.

896
01:43:21,627 --> 01:43:26,340
If you ask me, I'll say yes.

897
01:43:28,050 --> 01:43:30,050
I...

898
01:43:31,429 --> 01:43:36,100
There's a lot of reasons.

899
01:43:36,767 --> 01:43:42,939
If you had sex with Simon...
- What?

900
01:43:43,857 --> 01:43:49,529
That's just one idea.
- That's why you brought me?

901
01:43:49,696 --> 01:43:54,117
Like I'm a what..?
And I owe you what?

902
01:43:54,284 --> 01:43:59,039
I don't know why I brought you.
It was just one thought.

903
01:43:59,205 --> 01:44:02,750
It came out first.

904
01:44:02,916 --> 01:44:07,166
You kiss him... me...
You two seemed to hit it off.

905
01:44:07,254 --> 01:44:11,967
Wait. I didn't mean...
Forget what I said about Simon.

906
01:44:12,134 --> 01:44:15,888
I'll never forget it.
- A mistake.

907
01:44:16,096 --> 01:44:18,474
It was a mistake.

908
01:44:24,020 --> 01:44:28,716
Hello, this is Fred Bishop.
We're unable to take yourcall.

909
01:44:28,816 --> 01:44:34,405
Leave a message.
- Say goodbye... and thank you.

910
01:44:34,781 --> 01:44:37,742
It's Simon.

911
01:44:38,326 --> 01:44:41,286
I'm in town.

912
01:44:45,499 --> 01:44:51,421
You've never been out later than
ten o'clock. Pick up the phone.

913
01:44:53,590 --> 01:44:56,510
Really.

914
01:44:59,888 --> 01:45:04,478
I'm going to try you in the morning.
I need to see you.

915
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:08,000
Or at least get you to answer the phone.

916
01:45:16,695 --> 01:45:18,695
How are you?

917
01:45:19,281 --> 01:45:24,728
ls this going to be your room?
- Our room. I don't want to see him.

918
01:45:24,828 --> 01:45:28,998
What happened?
- Don't ask.

919
01:45:31,584 --> 01:45:35,880
Can you not be so violent?
- I don't think so.

920
01:45:39,133 --> 01:45:42,261
I'm taking a big bath.

921
01:45:42,427 --> 01:45:45,472
Are you okay?

922
01:45:45,848 --> 01:45:49,643
Don't ask.
I'm tired of my complaints.

923
01:45:49,852 --> 01:45:54,690
What are you thinking about?
- How to die, mostly.

924
01:45:56,149 --> 01:46:01,164
Can you believe, in our little mix
you're the good roommate?

925
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:15,376
Goodnight.

926
01:46:57,750 --> 01:47:01,544
Hold it.

927
01:47:20,437 --> 01:47:23,607
I have to draw you.

928
01:47:25,650 --> 01:47:28,904
I have to draw you.
- No.

929
01:47:29,071 --> 01:47:33,658
I'm more shy than people think.
- I have to.

930
01:47:33,825 --> 01:47:38,415
I haven't sketched in weeks.
- Stop staring. Do a vase.

931
01:47:39,748 --> 01:47:44,543
But you're beautiful, Carol.
Your skin, your long neck.

932
01:47:45,127 --> 01:47:48,506
The back. The line of you.

933
01:47:50,090 --> 01:47:54,553
You're why cavemen chiselled on walls.

934
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:59,767
Cut me a break.

935
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:25,780
The next thing I know
she's sitting next to me.

936
01:48:26,917 --> 01:48:32,297
It's not right to go into details.
I got nervous.

937
01:48:32,464 --> 01:48:35,884
I said the wrong thing.

938
01:48:38,846 --> 01:48:41,889
Where, if I hadn't, -...

939
01:48:42,056 --> 01:48:45,977
I could be in bed now with a woman who...

940
01:48:46,143 --> 01:48:50,314
If you make her laugh,
you got a life.

941
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:54,360
lnstead, I'm here with you.

942
01:48:54,527 --> 01:48:59,657
No offence, but a moron
pushing the last legal drug.

943
01:49:03,034 --> 01:49:06,162
Jameson, soda back.

944
01:49:07,747 --> 01:49:12,068
I don't care how you put this.
We're being naughty here, pal.

945
01:49:12,168 --> 01:49:17,132
No, this is...
This is great. This is so great.

946
01:49:17,299 --> 01:49:22,094
My hand won't even keep up.
Hold it.

947
01:49:22,261 --> 01:49:26,056
I'm just turning.
- But hold that.

948
01:49:26,890 --> 01:49:30,519
My hand's not even bothering me.

949
01:49:32,688 --> 01:49:36,567
I can't get the angle with this cast.

950
01:49:39,945 --> 01:49:42,196
Careful.

951
01:49:48,578 --> 01:49:50,578
PRlVACY

952
01:49:53,291 --> 01:49:57,045
I'm coming in. It's late.

953
01:50:02,549 --> 01:50:08,263
Did you have sex with her?
- Don't you want your shampoos?

954
01:50:12,142 --> 01:50:14,142
Sorry.

955
01:50:15,353 --> 01:50:19,757
I didn't know she was still here...
Did you have sex with her?

956
01:50:19,857 --> 01:50:24,957
To hell with sex. It was better
than sex. We held each other.

957
01:50:25,571 --> 01:50:31,494
What I need, he gave me great.
I'll get dressed in a hurry.

958
01:50:36,582 --> 01:50:39,585
I just love her.

959
01:50:44,672 --> 01:50:47,800
How are you doing?

960
01:51:02,397 --> 01:51:06,360
Mom, hi.
- Hello, Simon.

961
01:51:06,527 --> 01:51:10,180
You were right We were home.
- Do you have to whisper?

962
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:15,702
I'm nota screamer.
- It was lucky you didn't answer.

963
01:51:15,869 --> 01:51:19,814
Yourfatheris not feeling well.
- I can't hear you.

964
01:51:19,914 --> 01:51:23,125
Hold on.
- What are you going to do?

965
01:51:23,751 --> 01:51:28,072
I get why you're angry with me...
- He's talking to his parents.

966
01:51:28,172 --> 01:51:32,802
Listen to me. Truly no grudges.

967
01:51:33,010 --> 01:51:37,748
It was odd that you didn't come and
see me when you heard I was hurt.

968
01:51:37,848 --> 01:51:40,750
We almost did.
- I don't want to talk about it.

969
01:51:40,850 --> 01:51:45,355
The important thing is
that your son is happy.

970
01:51:45,522 --> 01:51:48,837
I'm working again.
- Good. Aboutmoney...

971
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:56,074
No. I'll drop you a line. It's up
to you to make the next move.

972
01:51:56,241 --> 01:52:01,596
He's going to want to stay.
And they'll take a ride to the lake.

973
01:52:02,371 --> 01:52:07,126
Bye-bye.
- Goodbye, dear.

974
01:52:08,293 --> 01:52:13,903
We'll probably have a five-hour
drive. It'll give us a chance to...

975
01:52:14,883 --> 01:52:18,345
I'm coming.
- What about your parents?

976
01:52:18,512 --> 01:52:22,373
No. I'll take care of myself.
- What are you talking about?

977
01:52:22,473 --> 01:52:27,687
You've got real problems.
- I know. I'm a little bit nervous.

978
01:52:27,854 --> 01:52:31,524
Suddenly everything seems so easy.

979
01:52:31,899 --> 01:52:35,486
Carol, a load has been lifted.

980
01:52:37,905 --> 01:52:41,645
One night wih me.
- You think you're kidding.

981
01:52:45,328 --> 01:52:50,625
No choice.
- I've got a gift for you.

982
01:52:50,792 --> 01:52:54,588
Let me see... Gorgeous.

983
01:52:55,505 --> 01:53:00,326
Do it. And get the dog picked up. I
can't believe he let it stay there.

984
01:53:00,426 --> 01:53:03,220
Goodbye.

985
01:53:03,429 --> 01:53:05,598
Your luck's running.

986
01:53:05,765 --> 01:53:10,895
They sub-let your place.
You're homeless.

987
01:53:11,061 --> 01:53:16,734
Frank's got a line on a new place.
- Where?

988
01:53:17,401 --> 01:53:20,945
Does it matter?

989
01:53:22,030 --> 01:53:25,033
No, it doesn't.

990
01:53:25,950 --> 01:53:29,037
I'm fine. Like the hat?

991
01:53:30,163 --> 01:53:32,163
I'm sorry.

992
01:53:47,054 --> 01:53:49,473
FOR EMERGENCY USE ONLY...

993
01:54:04,654 --> 01:54:09,909
I don't want to hear that music.
- You said you liked it.

994
01:54:12,370 --> 01:54:18,709
This one has a meaning.
- I don't want to hear it.

995
01:54:40,980 --> 01:54:45,192
Here's the keys to my apartment.

996
01:54:45,359 --> 01:54:49,613
Go up there and wait
and I'll take Carol home.

997
01:54:49,780 --> 01:54:54,326
I'll take a bus.
- No, I'll take you.

998
01:54:59,747 --> 01:55:02,667
Can you come here?

999
01:55:02,834 --> 01:55:06,696
I don't care what you did for me.
- What's wrong?

1000
01:55:06,796 --> 01:55:12,321
I don't want to know you any more.
All you do is make me feel bad.

1001
01:55:15,555 --> 01:55:18,516
You have my number.

1002
01:55:19,891 --> 01:55:24,062
Let him take you home.
- Don't want to.

1003
01:55:25,147 --> 01:55:28,275
I love you.
- I love you too.

1004
01:55:36,783 --> 01:55:39,535
Don't say anything.

1005
01:55:43,122 --> 01:55:48,562
I've got to get a hold of Frank
and see where I'm hanging my hat.

1006
01:55:49,545 --> 01:55:53,370
I think you're going to have to camp it here.

1007
01:55:53,424 --> 01:55:56,719
There's Verdell.

1008
01:56:04,934 --> 01:56:08,521
Mommy and Daddy are home.

1009
01:56:10,023 --> 01:56:14,277
Sorry. You're fun to mess with.

1010
01:56:15,445 --> 01:56:20,849
They rented your place furnished.
Jackie said she'd bring your things.

1011
01:56:20,949 --> 01:56:25,829
They were going to set you up
in here. It's an extra room.

1012
01:56:25,996 --> 01:56:31,001
It's got good light.
- I'm coming.

1013
01:56:35,964 --> 01:56:39,926
It's nice. Looks good.

1014
01:56:40,134 --> 01:56:47,725
They've even got your music,
paintings, paints.

1015
01:56:47,892 --> 01:56:50,782
I have to say they did a good job.

1016
01:56:53,147 --> 01:56:59,277
It's going to be okay.
Cosy, huh?

1017
01:57:04,074 --> 01:57:08,662
Thank you, Melvin.
You overwhelm me.

1018
01:57:15,961 --> 01:57:19,755
I love you.

1019
01:57:23,842 --> 01:57:30,516
I'd be the luckiest guy alive
if that did it for me.

1020
01:57:42,652 --> 01:57:46,280
Make yourself at home.

1021
01:57:47,615 --> 01:57:50,243
Anything else in the bag?

1022
01:57:50,410 --> 01:57:54,163
But I was playing soccer
while you were away.

1023
01:57:54,330 --> 01:57:57,834
I love my cookbook.

1024
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:03,004
It's got wonderful recipes.
It says something with a shark.

1025
01:58:03,171 --> 01:58:08,427
Shark with a bite.
Would you like that, Spencer?

1026
01:58:08,593 --> 01:58:12,078
And some cookies here
called Wasps' Nests.

1027
01:58:14,725 --> 01:58:18,186
Where is my big hairy boy?

1028
01:58:18,395 --> 01:58:23,190
Where is he?
Where is my beautiful boy?

1029
01:58:23,357 --> 01:58:25,526
Sweetheart.

1030
01:58:25,693 --> 01:58:29,155
Oh, you're in bed.
- No, no.

1031
01:58:32,533 --> 01:58:39,747
I just didn't think Verdell should
get too comfortable sleeping here.

1032
01:58:39,914 --> 01:58:43,585
The dog's already comfortable.

1033
01:58:47,589 --> 01:58:49,589
ls this okay?

1034
01:58:51,509 --> 01:58:55,054
Hello... Hi, it's me.

1035
01:58:55,513 --> 01:59:00,767
He took me in.
It's Carol for you.

1036
01:59:00,934 --> 01:59:05,772
Jackie brought it all over...
- Just take the dog.

1037
01:59:06,773 --> 01:59:08,773
Take the dog.

1038
01:59:12,112 --> 01:59:17,618
Come on. Move fast. Don't limp.
- Good luck.

1039
01:59:33,966 --> 01:59:37,094
Howare you doing?
- Not so hot.

1040
01:59:37,261 --> 01:59:43,016
Why? What's wrong?
- Was I sensible or hard on you?

1041
01:59:43,308 --> 01:59:49,606
Maybe both.
- Are you being cute or crazy now?

1042
01:59:49,773 --> 01:59:54,444
Cute.
- You don't have to answer.

1043
01:59:54,653 --> 01:59:57,072
Just listen to me.

1044
01:59:57,822 --> 02:00:02,184
It's really something
that you're looking after Simon.

1045
02:00:02,284 --> 02:00:07,956
And what I said on the street...
That was a bad thing to say.

1046
02:00:08,165 --> 02:00:14,296
It made me sick to my stomach.
It was a bad thing to say.

1047
02:00:14,672 --> 02:00:19,384
And I'd be lying if I didn't say
I enjoy your company.

1048
02:00:21,010 --> 02:00:27,141
But you do bother me.
And I know it's better for me...

1049
02:00:27,350 --> 02:00:32,005
...to not have contact with you
because you're not ready.

1050
02:00:32,105 --> 02:00:36,718
You're an old guy to not be ready.
And I'm too old to ignore that.

1051
02:00:36,818 --> 02:00:42,489
But there were extraordinary
kindnesses that did take place.

1052
02:00:49,162 --> 02:00:52,124
Anyway. Thanks for the trip.

1053
02:00:53,917 --> 02:00:56,253
Goodnight.

1054
02:00:56,420 --> 02:00:59,505
Okay if I say something now?

1055
02:01:03,551 --> 02:01:06,137
Go ahead.

1056
02:01:07,138 --> 02:01:11,308
I should have danced with you.

1057
02:01:14,395 --> 02:01:17,857
Goodnight.

1058
02:01:37,417 --> 02:01:42,004
Are you going to talk to me?
- I'm coming.

1059
02:01:52,431 --> 02:01:57,477
What did she say?
- That I'm a great guy.

1060
02:01:57,644 --> 02:02:01,898
And she doesn't want contact with me.

1061
02:02:03,024 --> 02:02:05,902
I'm dying here.

1062
02:02:07,194 --> 02:02:13,117
Because... you love her.
- No.

1063
02:02:13,284 --> 02:02:16,604
And you people
are supposed to be sensitive?

1064
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:21,191
Then you tell me why.
You're the one who's 'dying here'.

1065
02:02:21,291 --> 02:02:24,961
Let me sleep on it.
- Oh, come on.

1066
02:02:25,128 --> 02:02:28,923
I'll figure it out.
- Please...

1067
02:02:30,342 --> 02:02:36,723
I'm stuck.
I can't get back to my old life.

1068
02:02:38,849 --> 02:02:43,837
She's evicted me from my life.
- Did you really like it that much?

1069
02:02:43,937 --> 02:02:47,149
It's better than this.

1070
02:02:47,316 --> 02:02:51,845
If you're going to give me hope,
you've got to do better.

1071
02:02:51,945 --> 02:02:55,891
If you can't be mildly interesting,
then shut up.

1072
02:02:55,991 --> 02:03:00,061
I'm drowning here.
And you're describing the water.

1073
02:03:00,161 --> 02:03:03,247
Picking on me won't help.

1074
02:03:04,374 --> 02:03:08,252
If that's true,
I'm really in trouble.

1075
02:03:08,419 --> 02:03:12,465
Do you know where you're lucky?

1076
02:03:17,220 --> 02:03:20,889
You know who you want.

1077
02:03:21,056 --> 02:03:27,145
I would take your seat any day.
Do something. Go over there.

1078
02:03:27,312 --> 02:03:32,609
Tonight. It's not always good
to let things calm down.

1079
02:03:32,776 --> 02:03:36,780
You can do this, Melvin.

1080
02:03:36,947 --> 02:03:40,157
Tell her how you feel.

1081
02:03:40,366 --> 02:03:44,578
I'm charged.
- Yes, you are.

1082
02:03:44,745 --> 02:03:49,442
She might kill me if I go there.
- Then stay. I'll read you a story.

1083
02:03:49,542 --> 02:03:55,492
The best thing going for you is your
willingness to humiliate yourself.

1084
02:03:55,506 --> 02:03:59,259
Go over there.
Do this. Catch her off guard.

1085
02:04:09,060 --> 02:04:11,729
Thanks a lot.

1086
02:04:13,398 --> 02:04:16,192
Here I go.

1087
02:04:25,242 --> 02:04:28,036
What's wrong?

1088
02:04:29,621 --> 02:04:32,749
I forgot to lock the door.

1089
02:05:51,032 --> 02:05:54,687
What do you want?
- I'm sorry I woke you up.

1090
02:05:54,827 --> 02:05:58,121
I wasn't asleep.

1091
02:06:01,458 --> 02:06:04,461
What a break.

1092
02:06:05,420 --> 02:06:09,091
ls it a secret what you're doing here?

1093
02:06:11,343 --> 02:06:14,304
I had to see you.

1094
02:06:17,473 --> 02:06:19,767
Because?

1095
02:06:22,186 --> 02:06:26,232
It relaxes me.

1096
02:06:26,690 --> 02:06:30,928
I'd feel better sitting outside
your apartment on the curb -...

1097
02:06:31,028 --> 02:06:35,407
...than any other place
I can think of or imagine.

1098
02:06:35,574 --> 02:06:38,201
That's overstating.

1099
02:06:38,368 --> 02:06:44,249
I'd rather be sitting inside so I
don't get my feet in the gutter.

1100
02:06:44,415 --> 02:06:49,963
Stop. Why can't I just have
a normal boyfriend? Why?

1101
02:06:50,129 --> 02:06:53,954
A regular boyfriend
who doesn't go nuts on me.

1102
02:06:54,050 --> 02:06:57,427
Everybody wants that.
It doesn't exist.

1103
02:07:01,056 --> 02:07:06,186
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

1104
02:07:12,317 --> 02:07:15,529
Boyfriend...

1105
02:07:18,406 --> 02:07:23,703
Come on in and try
not to ruin everything by being you.

1106
02:07:23,911 --> 02:07:28,040
Maybe we could live
without the wisecracks?

1107
02:07:31,419 --> 02:07:35,172
Maybe we could.

1108
02:08:00,070 --> 02:08:05,075
It feels a little confined here.
Let's take a walk.

1109
02:08:07,995 --> 02:08:13,542
It's four in the morning.
A walk sounds a little screwy to me.

1110
02:08:14,418 --> 02:08:19,589
If you don't mind.
- Well, if you need an excuse...

1111
02:08:20,423 --> 02:08:24,758
There's a bakery on the corner
that'll be open soon.

1112
02:08:24,802 --> 02:08:30,558
That way we're not screwy,
but two people that like warm rolls.

1113
02:08:54,873 --> 02:09:01,295
What are you doing?
- I want you to hear that song.

1114
02:09:08,677 --> 02:09:13,516
And darling I'm neverlonely...

1115
02:09:13,682 --> 02:09:17,185
...wheneveryou're in sight...

1116
02:09:18,019 --> 02:09:20,019
Thank you.

1117
02:09:21,523 --> 02:09:24,818
I was...

1118
02:09:38,705 --> 02:09:43,961
I'm sorry.
Whatever this is won't work.

1119
02:09:52,386 --> 02:09:54,805
I'm...
- What?

1120
02:09:56,973 --> 02:09:59,767
I'm feeling better.

1121
02:09:59,934 --> 02:10:06,816
It may seem that way now,
but you don't know me all that well.

1122
02:10:07,692 --> 02:10:10,736
I'm not the answer for you.

1123
02:10:10,903 --> 02:10:14,991
I've got a compliment for you.
- You know what?

1124
02:10:15,157 --> 02:10:19,035
Let me talk.

1125
02:10:25,625 --> 02:10:29,379
I might be the only person on the earth -...

1126
02:10:29,587 --> 02:10:32,657
...that knows
you're the greatest woman on earth.

1127
02:10:32,757 --> 02:10:40,347
I might be the only one who knows
how amazing you are.

1128
02:10:40,723 --> 02:10:44,893
And how you are with Spencer.
Spence.

1129
02:10:46,103 --> 02:10:50,316
And in every single thought you have.

1130
02:10:50,482 --> 02:10:57,196
How you almost always mean something
that's about being straight or good.

1131
02:10:58,448 --> 02:11:02,285
Most people miss that about you.

1132
02:11:02,618 --> 02:11:07,857
I wonder how they can watch you
bring their food and clear tables -...

1133
02:11:07,957 --> 02:11:12,362
...and never get that they just met
the greatest woman alive.

1134
02:11:12,462 --> 02:11:17,591
And the fact that I get it
makes me feel good...

1135
02:11:18,508 --> 02:11:22,721
...about me.

1136
02:11:29,144 --> 02:11:35,609
ls that something
that it's bad for you to be around?

1137
02:11:44,784 --> 02:11:47,203
No.

1138
02:11:49,955 --> 02:11:53,209
I'm going to grab you?

1139
02:11:53,375 --> 02:11:58,645
I didn't mean for that to be
a question. I'm going to grab you.

1140
02:12:21,527 --> 02:12:24,404
I know I can do better than that.

1141
02:12:47,843 --> 02:12:51,722
Better. Definitely better.

1142
02:12:55,726 --> 02:12:58,728
See?

1143
02:13:12,742 --> 02:13:17,454
Want something?
- Warm rolls.

1144
02:13:26,005 --> 02:13:28,215
Excuse us.
