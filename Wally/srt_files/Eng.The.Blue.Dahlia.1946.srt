How about that good-bye drink, Johnny?

- Why not? One bar's just like another.
- So long as they got bourbon.

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,316
Or a reasonable facsimile.

- Bourbon straight with a bourbon chaser.

- The same.
- Two separate glasses. Get it?

Why wouldn't I get it?

Got to have that monkey music in here?

- Somebody call me a monkey?
- Give that thing a rest, will you?

Pipe down. It's his nickel.

Nobody called nobody nothing.
Just forget it, will you?

- Put that back, but quick.

- Steady, Corporal.
- Get out of my way!

I said steady. You didn't get those stripes
from blowing your top.

Maybe bigger.

I think you'd better leave.

He probably wants to beat me up.

- Perhaps you want me to apologise.
- Apologise, darling?

would have made a little more difference.

and I did the laundry.

I don't have a kid to look after anymore.

And the people I go with now don't use
a kiss as an excuse to sock each other.

00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,870
- I thought you were going to Malibu?
- I flipped a coin.

333
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,191
Heads, I go to Malibu. Tails, I go to Laguna.

334
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,271
What happens if the coin
rolls under the davenport?

335
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,918
We go to Long Beach.

336
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,358
Oh, you can smile.
I was beginning to wonder.

337
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,599
- Sure you won't have one?
- No, thanks.

338
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,796
- My bag in your way?
- No.

339
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,190
I was just wondering what the JM stood for.

340
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,431
- You don't have to wonder. I'll tell you.
- Well, that's no fun.

341
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,909
Let me see. How about Jack Mason?

342
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,078
That's fine for somebody named Jack Mason.

343
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,476
Well, then, how about Jeremiah McGonigle?

344
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,200
Nobody was ever named
Jeremiah McGonigle.

345
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,033
- Why?
- I think I like Jeremiah McGonigle.

346
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,155
Dull. No sense of humour.

347
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,549
Well, that's two strikes on me.

348
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,314
- How about Jimmy Moore?
- Jimmy Moore?

349
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,238
- Is that really your name?
- Don't you like it?

350
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,153
I once knew a boy by the name of Jimmy.
He had rabbit teeth.

351
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,313
I guess I'll learn to forget him, though.
I was only eight years old then.

352
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,075
Are you sure that coin you flipped
came up heads?

353
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,149
Yes. Why?

354
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,952
- That was Malibu we just passed.
- Was it?

355
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,588
GEORGE: Where have you been?

356
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,596
- Out.
- Out where?

357
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,238
- Guess I got lost.
- You guess? Don't you know?

358
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,992
Yeah, I got lost.

359
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,352
- Where's Johnny?
- Johnny hasn't been here.

360
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,754
Johnny?

361
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,437
Buzz, are you all right?

362
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,478
Certainly I'm all right.
Why wouldn't I be all right?

363
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,516
What's the idea of running out
without telling me?

364
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,875
You've been gone a couple of hours.

365
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,031
Well, for Pete's sake,
you might at least say something.

366
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,712
I'm sleepy, George.

367
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,953
I'd better telephone my friends
or they'll think something's happened.

368
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,598
I won't be long.

369
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,474
Jimmy!

370
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,918
What's the idea?

371
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,514
- It's the end of the line.
- Is it?

372
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,831
It has to be. It's a long way back to Malibu.

373
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,150
- What about you?
- I'll make out.

374
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,513
And if I knew how,
this is where I'd say thanks for everything.

375
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,716
I didn't do it for thanks.

376
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,959
I know that.

377
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,869
Well, don't you even say good night?

378
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,472
It's good-bye.
And it's tough to say good-bye.

379
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,717
Why is it?
You've never seen me before tonight.

380
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,192

- Looks like there was a brawl here.
- Yeah.

398
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,429
- Been dead for hours.
- Suicide?

399

- What's the number down there?
- Don't you think we ought to

404
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,554
- Iook around a bit before we call the police?
- Don't be a fool.

405
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,154
The sooner we get started,
the sooner we'll get her out of here.

- What happened to Malibu?
- I guess it's where we left it.

413
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,153
- I stayed here at the inn.
- Why?

- No.

Jimmy, why don't you go back and fix it up
before it's too late?

418
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,876
Maybe you'd like it better
if I'd mind my own business.

You think you could?

420
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,114
- I could try.
- It's my wife.

- And there's nothing to fix up.

422

And if there was,
I wouldn't want to fix it up anyway.

What about you?

424
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,395
You weren't going to Malibu last night.
You were trying to run out on yourself.

425
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,754
Like me.

426
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,951

Well, where do we go from here?

00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,829
We don't go anywhere.
We said good-bye last night.

429
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,874
You catch the bus for up north,
and I go back to Malibu.

430
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,993
That's right.

431
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,074

And look for moonstones? The tide's out.

We can even go wading, if you like.

will you be here when I get back?

00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,593
Fairly well.

498
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,190
How long have you known her?

499
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,269
- You've got all that.
- So I have.

500
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,909
Slightly less than a year.
Met her through mutual friends.

501
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,989
Correct.

502
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,236
She owned a business in Beverly Hills.
You have any interest in that?

503
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,039
I loaned her some money when she first
bought it. The money's been repaid.

504
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,634
I see. Purely a business transaction.

505
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,118
I'd regard a secured loan at 6%
as a business transaction.

506
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,998
I suppose you think I'm wasting your time?

507
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,993
You're married, aren't you, Mr Harwood?

508
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,911
My wife and I are separated.
You want to know why?

509
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,753
Not unless it has a bearing
on your relations with Mrs Morrison.

510
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,114
It hasn't.

511
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,748
- Where is Mrs Harwood at the moment?
- No idea.

512
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,916
Any idea where she was last night?

513
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,149
No.

514
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,074
Look here, Hendrickson, if you think
my wife had anything to do

515
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,310
with Helen Morrison's murder...

516
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,713
So you're taking it for granted
that Mrs Morrison was murdered, are you?

517
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,156
- Well, wasn't she?
- We haven't called it murder so far.

518
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,636
Yes, but the newspapers...

519
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,030
Well, then I just assumed it.

520
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,396
Sure, but you're quite right.
She was murdered.

521
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,834
We have the autopsy report now
and nitrate tests of her hands.

522
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,794
Well, thanks for coming in, Mr Harwood.
I guess that's all for now.

523
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,517
Am I under suspicion?

524
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,398
I don't know. How do you feel about it?

525
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,153
Hello, George?

526
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,033
Isn't George there?

527
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,315
George Copeland.

528
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,236
No, George isn't here right now.
Who's this calling? Who's calling, I said!

529
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,117
There's just one thing
I'd like you gentlemen to bear in mind.

530
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,839
Even if you are close friends of Morrison's,

531
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,639
you can't help him to hide out, so don't try.

532
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,712
I'm an attorney, Captain.
I understand perfectly.

533
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,472
I'm glad to hear it.

534
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,028
If he gets in touch with you,
make him come in.

535
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,476
- It's the only sensible thing for him to do.
- Baloney!

536
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,710
If you think we're gonna help you
tie a murder to a guy

537
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,917
who's flown us through 112 missions,
you're off your nut!

538
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,275
We haven't accused Morrison
of murder so far.

539
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,430
No, what's holding you up?

540
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,632
Have these men driven back
to their apartment. Bring in that Newell.

541
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,359
Any chance for a room here?

542
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,910
I'm sorry, sir, we haven't had a vacancy
in eight weeks.

543
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,194
Do you know where I can find one?

544
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,510
That's a pretty difficult thing to say
these days.

545
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,672
- I'm afraid I can't help you.
- All right, thanks.

546
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,513
You! Just a minute!

547
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,479
Got a match?

548
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,715
Okay. Use one of my own.

549
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,479
- Suitcase gets kind of heavy, don't it?
- Yeah, what's it to you?

550
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,271
Every hotel in town's loaded.
Thought I might be a little help.

551
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,397
Little place
down on Santa Monica boulevard.

552
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,109
- What's the racket?
- Lf you think it's a racket, call a cop.

553
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,791
- How far away is this place?
- About six blocks.

554
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,278
Transportation and everything. Okay?

555
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,589
Okay.

556
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,512
You saw Harwood go up to this dame's
apartment and knock on the door.

557
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,398
No answer. He went away. Went away where?

558
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,593
Well, you see Captain, there's a side gate
to the hotel grounds...

559
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,954
We've seen the joint.

560
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,395
Well, that's where he went out.
What time was this?

561
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,313
- I've told you gentlemen...
- Tell us again.

562
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,630
It was about 7:00. It was raining.

563
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,439
- You like standing in the rain?
- I got to make my rounds.

564
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,795
See if everything's okay.
Nobody cutting up too much.

565
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,394
You got a passkey to the bungalows?

566
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,916
- Surely you don't think I had...
- Why not?

567
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,515
Plenty of genial old parties like you
commit murders.

568
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,673
That isn't a very nice thing to say, Captain.
Mrs Morrison's lights were on.

569
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,716
The radio was going.
Why would I want to get in?

570
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,712
You tell us?
She didn't answer when Harwood knocked.

571
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,475
- Didn't that interest you?
- Would that be any of my business?

572
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,073
You boys got a nice technique.
Had me worried for a minute.

573
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,833
No hard feelings, of course.

574
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,911
That's all, Newell, for now.

575
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,596
- This is a terrible thing for the hotel.
- Kind of tough on the Morrison dame, too.

576
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,238
Go on, beat it!

577
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,592
JOHNNY: You call this dump a hotel?
MAN: That's what the sign said.

578
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,194
Clean sheets every day, they tell me.

579
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,316
- How often do they change the fleas?
- Hmm, very funny.

580
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,558
Customer, Corelli.

581
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,197
That'll be 10 bucks.

582
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,030
In advance, Mr Moore.

583
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,114
- That'll be 10 for us, too.
- What?

584
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,236
Our commission. Get it?

585
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,716
- Give me back that money.
- You ain't going to get difficult, are you, pal?

586
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,078
Okay, boys, you win.

587
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,789
(GRUNTS)

588
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,316
- Hot, ain't it?
- Yeah.

589
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,632
Hi, Corelli.

590
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,513
Anybody up here belong
to that Plymouth down front?

591
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,589
Why?

592
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,713
Some crazy woman driver
just tore a fender off it.

593
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,439
- I didn't hear nothing.
- No?

594
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,390
MAN: What's a fender? Forget it.

595
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,197
- Your car?
- Could be.

596
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,669
Come on down, then.
We got to make a report.

597
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,637
Let's skip it, huh?

598
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,872
You heard what I said, didn't you?
Come on down. That's a hot car!

599
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,552
(GUN FIRING)

600
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,108
Come on, get back here.
Come on get up, you.

601
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,070
Come on, quick. Turn around.

602
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,959
That's it. You want to play rough, huh?

603
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,275
You boys make it easy for us.

604
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,793
All right, get going.

605
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,553
Who are you?

606
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,231
- Jimmy Moore, San Francisco.
- That right, Corelli?

607
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,551
- Yeah, he just registered.
- Okay.

608
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,873
Get moving.

609
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,473
Thanks, pal.

610
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,113
- You still want that room?
- Lf you're sure nobody's dead in it.

611
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,192
Right back this way.

612
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,037
You live in San Francisco, Mr Moore?

613
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,594
- Yeah, when I'm there.
- Nice town.

614
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,157
I like it here better.

615
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,434
Anything you need, just ask for it.

616
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,593
- Where's your phone?
- Back down the hall.

617
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,754
WOMAN OVER PHONE: <i>Grenada Towers.</i>
<i>JOHNNY. Mr Harwood, please.</i>

618
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,114
(PHONE RINGING)

619
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,148
(KEY TURNING IN DOOR)

620
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,111
Good evening, Mr Harwood.

621
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,873
Who let you in?

622
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,553
Housemen don't have much trouble
getting into places.

623
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,676
I come up the fire stairs.

624
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,393
Thought it was a good idea not to be seen.

625
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,108
- Drink?
- I don't mind if I do.

626
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,952
Easy on the water.

627
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,117
I told the homicide boys
a good straight story.

628
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,632
They're satisfied. For today, anyway.

629
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,074
But you know how these dicks are.

630
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:30,553
Tomorrow they might get to figuring
I was holding something back.

631
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,589
Nice.

632
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,595
And were you holding something back?

633
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,433
Well, I hung around a while.

634
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,197
After you knocked on Mrs Morrison's door,
I mean.

635
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,032
- Pretty wet, wasn't it?
- Weather don't bother me.

636
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:53,237
Used to be a copper myself.
Fifteen years of it.

637
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,674
Sit down.

638
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:10,072
- How much do they pay you over there?
- Twenty-eight a week and found.

639
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:14,433
- Not very much, is it?
- No, it's not, for a fact. Well, thanks.

640
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,752
So you thought you'd like to make
a little more. That's why you're here, huh?

641
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,956
Oh, you got me all wrong, Mr Harwood.
I just thought...

642
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,871
Yeah, I know, I know.

643
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,037
- How old are you, Dad?
- Going on 57.

644
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,956
Well, you've got a lot of life left in you,
unless you get careless.

645
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,190
I don't aim to get careless.

646
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:42,038
The cops don't pay you any money, and I do.

647
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,275
Here.

648
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,477
Gee, this sure is white of you, Mr Harwood.

649
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,154
Yes, isn't it? Finished your drink?

650
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,954
No, I...

651
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:04,116
Well, I guess I better be
going now, Mr Harwood.

652
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,793
Wait a minute.

653
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,674
- You forgot your cigar.
- Oh, I...

654
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,237
I think it's out.

655
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,913
Cigars go out awful easy, don't they, Dad?

656
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,879
Good night.

657
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,633
Hello, Eddie.

658
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,029
Hello, baby. Long time no see.

659
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,318
Not so long, is it?

660
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,518
You even send these blue flowers
to yourself, don't you?

661
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,592
- I thought you went out of town.
- I came back.

662
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,150
You still have this around.
Sentimentalist, aren't you?

663
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,711
I only wish I had you with it.

664
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,279
Sure, I know I've got lots of faults,

665
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,477
but being in love with you
isn't one of them, is it?

666
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,479
Look, baby...

667
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,357
It's too late, Eddie.

668
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,668
Why? Why is it too late?

669
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,028
Just is.

670
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,914
Helen Morrison didn't mean
anything to me alive.

671
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,069
No?

672
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:28,949
(SIGHS)

673
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,318
And she doesn't mean anything to me dead.

674
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,550
She means something to the police, though.

675
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,155
The police have the whole story.
My part of it, in any case.

676
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,869
- How do they like it?
- As well as they ever like anything.

677
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,433
Well, I guess everything's lovely, then.

678
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,876
Who did kill her, Eddie?

679
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,473
Don't you read the papers?

680
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,028
I don't have to believe
everything I see in them.

681
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,953
Well, if Morrison didn't kill her,
he certainly set himself up pretty.

682
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,838
- The gun even had his initials on it.
- Careless of him.

683
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,992
I met him. He's the kind of guy
who wouldn't care much what he did.

684
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,550
- When he walked in on that party...
- He didn't like it.

685
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,998
How would you know?

686
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,674
I know the kind of party it would be.

687
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,598
Well, so long as I know
you're all right, Eddie?

688
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,750
So I do mean that much to you?

689
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,193
I guess so.

690
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,717
Take me to the mezzanine, please.

691
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,989
Yes, sir.

692
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,230
- Is Mr Harwood in?
- I'll see.

693
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,390
- What name, please?
- Moore.

694
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,673
Mr Harwood?

695
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,431
Give me the desk, please.

696
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,950
Mr Harwood's line is busy at the moment.

697
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,508
- What's his apartment number?
- I'm sorry. You'll have to be announced.

698
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,113
I'll try again in a moment.

699
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,713
(PHONE RINGING)

700
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,475
Desk.

701
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,475
Who? Just a minute.

702
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,279
For you, sir.

703
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,149
Me?

704
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,869
Hello.

705
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,833
Please don't ask any questions.
Get out of the hotel right away.

706
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,793
Yeah, but why does it take so long?

707
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,952
Because when a man's in the service,
they file his photo in Washington.

708
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,031
They have to get it from there.

709
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:49,590
What I'm wondering is, who glommed
the photo the maid said was in the bedroom?

710
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,240
- Lf my name was Morrison, it would be me.
- Yeah.

711
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,312
The description we got could fit 1,000 guys.

712
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,714
Mr Harwood, please.
Captain Hendrickson calling.

713
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,119
Yes, sir.

714
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,273
Mr Harwood.

715
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,317
Anybody following us?

716
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,472
I don't think so.

717
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,758
That's too bad.

718
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,876
Do you want to get caught?

719
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:46,038
When did you find out
that somebody was trying to catch me?

720
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:49,271
This morning when I saw you
get rid of your coat.

721
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,158
Are you angry at me
for trying to help you, Jimmy?

722
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,913
Maybe you'd better call me by my right name.

723
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,197
None of this would make any sense
if you didn't know it.

724
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,952
All right, Johnny.

725
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,709
Johnny's quite a nice name, too.

726
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,838
But Jimmy didn't have the police after him.

727
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,510
It takes a lot of lights to make a city,
doesn't it?

728
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,679
I know you didn't kill your wife, Johnny.

729
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,230
- You do? How?
- Just from knowing you.

730
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,833
- You don't know me that well.
- Well enough.

731
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:40,314
You think you have to find out
who did kill her, though, don't you?

732
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,197
Something like that.

733
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,678
I suppose you wonder why
I don't let the police do that job.

734
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,194
Have I acted as if I thought that?

735
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,191
They're looking for me.

736
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,791
And if they catch me,
they're not gonna worry

737
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,030
about trying to pin it on somebody else.

738
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,839
- I've thought of that, too.
- That isn't all.

739
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,878
Even if we weren't happy, Helen was my wife.

740
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,557
And the man who killed her isn't gonna
get away with it. He just thinks he is.

741
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:13,679
- You're talking about Eddie Harwood?
- I didn't mention any names.

742
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,957
Who else could it be?

743
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,590
I wouldn't know. Would you?

744
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,755
- It seems you know more about it than I do.
- Do I?

745
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,635
Things like picking me out of the air
at a hotel desk.

746
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,597
You get around, don't you?
And your timing's good.

747
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:39,270
It was good last night
when you picked me up in the rain.

748
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:40,679
Or was it?

749
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,879
I don't know.

750
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,191
I don't know anything.

751
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,710
I don't even know your name.

752
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,873
Johnny, you'll have to trust me.
I have something to settle, too.

753
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,674
- You'll have to trust me a lot.
- Why?

754
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,588
I haven't got time to play games.

755
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:06,030
Suppose you keep your secrets,
and I'll keep mine, huh?

756
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,237
Okay, Johnny,
if that's the way you feel about it.

757
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,309
Coming?

758
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,554
BUZZ: Turn that radio down.
Turn it down, I tell you!

759
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:24,629
(BUZZ BANGING ON WALL)

760
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,076
Hey, calm down, can't you?
Other people have to live.

761
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,120
This headache I got don't calm down.

762
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:35,950
- Why don't Johnny call up or something?
- Maybe he forgot the number.

763
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,349
Maybe he doesn't want to take the chance.
Maybe he's not even in L.A.

764
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,477
That's three maybes.
You're not stuck, are you?

765
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,998
You know, I used to think of Johnny
on the dodge like a cheap criminal.

766
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,594
He ought to go straight to Hendrickson
and tell him his story.

767
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,468
Sure, tell it to the cops. Maybe you like cops.

768
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,954
Well, I don't. I hate their guts.

769
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:01,509
And you better hope
you never tell it to the cops, either.

770
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,039
What you need's a drink.

771
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:05,348
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

772
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:12,076
Let me see. I seem to have
misplaced your name at the moment.

773
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,639
Where were you keeping it?

774
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,553
But you're a friend of John Morrison's,
aren't you?

775
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,358
Never heard of him.

776
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,833
Come on in.

777
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,999
Who are you?

778
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,592
I work over at the Cavendish Court.
Newell's the name. They call me Dad.

779
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,113
- You work at what?
- Well...

780
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,111
You're the house peeper, ain't you?

781
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,475
Yeah, some folks call me that.

782
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,593
I don't suppose you gentlemen know
where Mr Morrison is, do you?

783
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,955
Would we be likely to tell you?

784
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,272
No, I suppose not.

785
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,516
Would information about his movements
be worth anything to you?

786
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,875
Depends on what the information is.

787
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,032
Well, information ain't always so easy to get.

788
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:02,875
- Quit stalling. Where did you see Johnny?
- I haven't said I did see him so far.

789
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,832
- This guy's looking for a piece of change.
- You just think of that?

790
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,832
Well, as a matter of fact,
it was a long walk over here.

791
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,831
Why don't you call a couple of those cops
you're so fond of?

792
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,035
He's been cheating on their terms.

793
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,509
Oh, now wait a minute, gentlemen.
You've got me all wrong.

794
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:16,749
Would that be possible?

795
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,354
I happened to be going by
Mr Harwood's hotel this evening...

796
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,637
- Oh, you put the bite on Harwood, too, huh?
- I resent that.

797
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,995
I saw Morrison go into the hotel
and cross over to the desk.

798
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:27,674
- Then what?
- I didn't have time to wait for any more.

799
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,354
He was standing at the desk when I left.
I had to get to work.

800
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,954
- The guy really likes his work.
- And how.

801
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,918
- Where does Harwood live?
- Grenada Towers on Wilshire.

802
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,276
- You know everything, don't you?
- Oh, I get around.

803
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,711
- That all you've got to tell us?
- So far it is.

804
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,677
Well, thanks.

805
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:56,718
Nights, Mr Harwood usually goes to his club,
the Blue Dahlia,

806
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,114
if that's of any interest to you.

807
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,876
Haven't I seen you before?

808
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,991
- Before what?
- Seems to me last night in the rain.

809
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,514
Or, of course, I could be mistaken.

810
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,273
Good night.

811
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,718
Mr Harwood, please. Mrs Harwood calling.

812
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:31,869
Eddie?

813
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,759
Yes, it's me.

814
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,439
I've changed my mind about something.
Do you want to take me out tonight?

815
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,957
Find what you wanted?

816
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:00,233
You look good in a uniform.
Nice kid, too. Yours?

817
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,039
Why didn't you tell me you was hot?
I've taken care of lots of hot boys.

818
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,509
All it takes is a little of that.

819
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,430
What makes you think I'm hot?

820
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,795
You ain't talking
to one of them cheap heist guys,

821
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,394
like them mugs that brought you here.

822
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:24,353
I've been in this business a long time.

823
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,038
Jimmy Moore, huh?

824
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,239
Seems like I read somewhere,
could have been the paper,

825
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,754
about a guy named Johnny Morrison,

826
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:43,875
the cops wanted to talk to
on account his wife got croaked.

827
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,912
No comment, huh?

828
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,033
Suit yourself.

829
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:58,150
Maybe I better keep this

997
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:00,913
- Give me another drink, will you?
- Yeah.

998
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,157
How much dough was in the billfold?

999
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:11,674
- What billfold?
- Pretty good fountain pen, too, huh?

1000
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,955
- Huh?
- What else did you get?

1001
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:17,069
- Nothing.
- Come on, hand it over.

1002
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:20,755
Okay.

1003
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:39,556
There's ethics in this business
the same as any other.

1004
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:51,835
Excuse me.
I thought my husband was in here.

1005
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:56,436
Hmm, give a look. Harwood's babe.
I bet she cost plenty, huh, George?

1006
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:59,557
How much would it cost to get you
to button your lip just once?

1007
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,949
I'm sorry. Mr Harwood went out.

1008
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,831
You're George and Buzz, aren't you?

1009
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:11,832
- Female detective.
- Johnny told me about you.

1010
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:16,038
- Why would he tell you anything?
- It just so happens I'm a friend of his, too.

1011
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:18,588
Since when? We only hit town yesterday.

1012
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:21,148
How long does it take
to become a friend of Johnny Morrison's?

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

1014
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:26,956
Oh, excuse me. Captain Hendrickson's
on the phone asking for Mr Harwood.

1015
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,155
What shall I tell him?

1016
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:31,550
Tell him to soak his head.
Get out of here and close that door.

1017
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:35,394
If I got to listen to any more
of that monkey music, I'll...

1018
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:38,315
Mr Harwood's on his way
to the Captain's office.

1019
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,278
- Just tell him he's left, Paul.
- Yes, madam.

1020
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,953
It's a shell fragment right above the ear.

1021
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:51,272
It kept playing over and over and over again.

1022
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:56,036
Like it was the only record they had.
It was in one of those ritzy bungalows.

1023
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,149
Buzz, what are you talking about?

1024
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,313
I don't know.

What are you doing that for?

1027
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:15,993
- Doing what?
- Picking at that flower.

1028
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,598
I don't like it.

1029
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,758
Say, that's funny.

1030
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:32,076
That's the same monkey music
they kept playing in the apartment next door.

1031
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:34,629
All day long, beating in my head.

1032
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:40,512
You've got to pull yourself together, fellow.

1033
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:45,116
It wasn't next door, either.
It was someplace else.

1034
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:53,398
The music was right in the same room
with us, and she kept picking at that flower.

1035
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:59,354
Just like you were doing.
Only she wouldn't stop.

1036
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,158
She kept right on doing it.

1037
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:27,989

01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:04,995
What?

1042
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:08,271
Give me that again, slow.

1043
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,916
Okay, tell him to relax.

1044
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,558
I'll be right back.

1045
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,115
Still playing the hotshot, huh?

Mr Bauer.

1048
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:31,590
Would you mind telling me
how you found out?

1049
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:36,276
Recognise that photograph on the floor?
Well, read what's on the back of it.

1050
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,958
That would be Helen.

1051
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:45,359
She wasn't a girl to throw away
this kind of information.

1052
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,749
Why didn't you make sure of that
before you killed her?

1053
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,798
In a hotel bungalow? With a.45?

1054
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,672
I could've arranged things better than that.

1055
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:56,671
Like you arranged this?

1056
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:02,117
This could've stood a little more polish, too.

1057
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:03,958
Just a cigarette.

1058
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:12,990
Maybe you're right at that.

1059
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:17,280
I'm not much of a hotshot after all.

1060
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:23,234
Such a nice clean start I had, too.

1061
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:30,399
Helping another wild kid
shoot a bank messenger back in Passaic.

1062
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:33,518
And for free. Didn't have a dime on him.

1063
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:38,992
And I spent the next 15 years
trying to kid myself it never happened.

1064
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:43,353
I get to own a war plant, a night club.

1065

I even marry a girl.

1066
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:51,437
A girl who oughtn't to have given me
the time of the day.

This is how I end up.

1068

What makes it even worse is the cops
aren't interested in either of us anymore.

1069
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,669
They've already got their killer.

1070

When?

1071
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:11,191
They caught up with him at the Blue Dahlia
a little while ago.

1072
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,953
One of your buddies. He just confessed.

1073
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:21,310

What's so wrong with that?"

01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,633
- That's the last I got.
- Newell, come here.

1081
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:09,835
Are you positive this is the man you saw
go into the bungalow with Mrs Morrison?

1082
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,639
I told you I did, didn't I? Ain't that enough?

1083
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:16,190
- It's our business to know what's enough.
- Take it easy.

1084
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:18,077
Now, let's get back to this shot you heard.

1085
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:20,276
Seeing you finally made your mind up
to tell us about it.

01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:21,998
Oh, now, wait a minute,
Captain Hendrickson.

1087
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,752
I ain't trying to hold anything back.

1088
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,037
It might have been backfire.
It ain't always so easy to tell.

1089
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:31,238
- What time was it?
- Near as I can figure, about 7:50.

1090
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,597
And what time did you say
this man got home?

1091
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:36,194
I didn't say. I didn't even say he went out.

1092
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:38,510
Quit trying to cover up for me, George.
Give them what they want.

1093
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:41,194
What for? To back up the evidence
of a cheap blackmailer?

1094
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:44,113
- Hey, just a minute.
- Shut up and sit down.

1095
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:46,273
Over there!

1096
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:52,593
Come on, son.

1097
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,638
You just about told us you killed her.
Why not give us the rest of it?

1098
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:59,110
Why do you have to keep pounding at him?
What more do you want him to say?

1099
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:02,192
It's got to make sense to us, too,
Mrs Harwood.

1100
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:07,873
You didn't go there to kill her.
You'd never even seen her before.

1101
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:11,148
What did she do that got you going?

1102
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,951
The things she said. What she was.

1103
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:20,469
What she did to Johnny.
She didn't even care.

1104
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,514
All she did was pick at that flower.

1105
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:28,470
And the gun lying right there in the chair,
asking you to use it.

1106
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,039
My head hurts.

1107
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:33,272
- I don't remember so good.
- Sure you remember.

1108
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:38,790
It's Johnny's wife we're talking about.
You remember Johnny's wife, all right.

1109
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,194
Johnny.

1110
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:44,475
Johnny. George. George, where's Johnny?

1111
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:47,838
Why ain't Johnny here? He'd know
I wouldn't mean to do a thing like that.

1112
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,069
No? Why wouldn't you?

1113
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,639
All you had to do was grab hold of the gun,

1114
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,597
jab it against her heart
and squeeze the trigger.

1115
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:54,511
That's the way it was, wasn't it?

1116
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:57,319
Come on, give out!
Don't try to dummy up on us.

1117
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:59,197
That's the way it was, wasn't it?

1118
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,919
- Sounds like you said it all.
- Johnny!

1119
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:06,077
Hello, Mr Morrison.
About time we got together.

1120
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:15,034
Nobody's gonna get hurt with this,
except maybe me. Buzz.

1121
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,397
Okay, Buzz, light it.

1122
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:24,193
Johnny, you're crazy.

1123
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,794
- Let him alone, give him back that gun.
- He can't do it anymore.

1124
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:30,190
He can do it with his eyes shut.
On your feet, Buzz.

1125
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:33,232
On your feet, I said.

1126
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:37,756
Now give him back that gun.

1127
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,990
All right, fella, light it up.

1128
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:53,199
Okay, skipper.

1129
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:03,394
I did it!

1130
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:06,393
- I did it, didn't I, Johnny?
- Sure you did.

1131
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,951
Jab it against her heart, huh?
Still buying that?

1132
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,039
I have to. That's how she was killed.

1133
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:16,277
- What says he killed her?
- It was his own idea.

1134
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:19,870
- Who sold him the idea?
- I did.

1135
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:24,954
- It would be me, wouldn't it?
- Would you mind telling me how?

1136
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:33,952
He got terribly upset when I began
to pull the petals from this flower.

1137
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:39,031
This is beginning to make sense.
He must have seen Helen do that, too.

1138
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:43,910
It was my gun. Helen and I were quarrelling.

1139
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:46,833
We were loud.

1140
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,950
You knew that. You heard us.

1141
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,668
Or didn't you tell them
about coming through that door?

1142
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,991
Sure I did.
Kind of had to, didn't I, Mr Morrison?

1143
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:02,630
Well, you got a fall guy standing right
in front of you. What more do you want?

1144
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:05,757
I just happen to be dumb enough
to want to get the right fall guy.

1145
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:08,559
When your wife was killed,
you were 50 miles north of here.

1146
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:10,153
Lets you out, doesn't it?

1147
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:14,756
Lets Mrs Harwood out, too.
Makes things a little tough for us, doesn't it?

1148
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:18,873
Yeah, you're right out on a limb.
So all you've got left is to pick on him.

1149
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:21,793
- We've still got Harwood, if we can find him.
- Well, you can count Harwood out.

1150
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:23,199
That's interesting.

1151
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:25,555
If you know where Leo's ranch is,
maybe you better go take a look.

1152
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:27,710
Think you can arrange that?

1153
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,228
Any further details?

1154
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:31,356
Look, Captain,
I'm not trying to run your business.

1155
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,874
You're doing fine. I'm not proud.

1156
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,191
You were swell in there a minute ago, Buzz.

1157
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,999
Still got that old circus shot,
ain't I, Johnny, huh?

1158
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,957
Sure you have,
but you got to have a lot more.

1159
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:43,951
Come on, tell me the part that counts.

1160
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:47,589
- Counts? The part...
- Yeah, come on, come on.

1161
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:53,354
That's what they keep saying. I hit that match
just like I used to, didn't I, Johnny, huh?

1162
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,715
He can't remember, Johnny.
He just doesn't know.

1163
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:56,994
Well...

1164
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,035
What's the matter with me, Johnny?

1165
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,031
There's nothing wrong with you, Buzz.
You just got to think.

1166
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:03,953
You got to remember, that's all.
All right now, for me. For me.

1167
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:07,999
What happened in the bungalow?
Come on, come on. That's right.

1168
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:11,709
Yeah, it was a bungalow, Johnny.
Yeah, and she...

1169
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:13,348
Come on.

1170
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:16,838
She kept picking at that flower, Johnny.
Just...

1171
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:18,558
Just like that one over there.

1172
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:21,438
- Yeah.
- She... And it was raining, and I...

- Come on, what happened, Buzz?
- Come on.

1175
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,910
My head...
The music was beating, Johnny. Beating.

1176
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:33,434
Beating, beating, beating, beating, beating!
Music in my head, Johnny.

1177
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:34,509
Is there a radio here?

1178
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:35,919
Johnny, you don't think I did it,
do you, Johnny?

1179
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,399
Is there a radio here?

1180
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:40,790
- Just the speaker from the dance floor.
- Turn it on.

1183
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:52,230
That monkey music again.
That monkey music.

1184
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:59,839
Okay, she did buy me a drink.

1185
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:02,797
What's wrong with that?

1186
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:07,158
I didn't even know who she was
until she started talking about Johnny.

1187
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:08,514
Will you cut that music out?

1188
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:12,036
Go on with the rest of it, Buzz.
Why did you kill her?

1189
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:16,709
Who says I killed her?
You can't hand me that stuff.

1190
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:20,397
Not even you.
I wouldn't dirty my hands on her.

1191
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:25,716
All right, turn it off.

1192
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,910
I didn't mean that, Johnny.

1193
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:33,915
I just had to get out of there.
I couldn't take it anymore.

1194
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:38,516
She called me back,
but I just kept right on going.

1195
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:43,591
And I don't know where.
I guess I must have gone home.

1196
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:46,159
That's where I went, wasn't it, George?

1197
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:47,798
He was wet enough
to have walked all the way.

1198
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:51,270
He got home three minutes past eight.
Are you satisfied?

1199
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:52,839
You could have told us that a long time ago.

1200
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:56,037
I guess you know why I didn't. I wasn't
sure enough when that shot was fired.

1201
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:57,439
Are you sure now?

1202
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:58,953
You've got a witness, haven't you?

1203
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:02,157
A witness you yourself called
a cheap blackmailer.

1204
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:05,835
Now just a minute.
I could be called that once too often.

1205
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:08,395
You be sure to tell us when to duck.

What makes you so top-heavy
all of a sudden?

1207
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:13,434
For all anybody here knows,
you could have killed Mrs Morrison yourself.

1208
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,795
Except that you fixed the time.

1209
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:19,999
Well, maybe I kind of made a mistake there.
Five or 10 minutes either way.

1210
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:23,914
Be hard to tell. I was kind of busy
keeping the rain off my neck.

1211
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:27,069
I ain't the wristwatch type, you know.

1212
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:29,799
That umbrella of yours
must've got pretty wet last night.

1213
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:31,393
That's what I bought it for.

1214
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:32,708
You ought to have left it on the porch,

1215
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:35,314
instead of letting it drip
all over Mrs Morrison's carpet.

1216
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:38,870
- I did leave it on the porch. That is, I...
- All right.

1217
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:42,191
Might as well wrap it up for tonight.
We don't seem to be getting anyplace.

1218
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:47,035
We'll want signed statements from all of you,
but tomorrow will be time enough.

1219
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:49,953
Yeah, I got to get back to the job myself.

1220
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:53,757
Well, good night, all.
No hard feelings, I hope.

1221
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:58,676
Oh, Captain, I wish you'd put in a good word
for me with the hotel manager.

1222
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:00,716
He's kind of sore at me.

1223
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:03,999
Surely not for blackmailing the guests.

1224
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,274
All right.

1225
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:11,029
You don't really think
you're going out that door, do you?

1226
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:16,792
What're you getting at?

1227
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:20,589
How much did you up the ante on her
when her husband came home?

1228
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:23,319
What did she threaten to do? Get you fired?

1229
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:27,393
Or was she going to have Harwood's friends
give you the treatment?

1230
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:29,948
Maybe she was going
to blow a hole in you herself.

1231
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:32,838
Only she wouldn't know how to handle
that kind of a gun.

1232
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:35,912
All you had to do
was grab it out of her hand.

1233
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:39,430
I guess even a very cheap blackmailer
could do that.

1234
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:40,953
Cheap, huh?

1235
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:44,476
Sure, a cigar and a drink
and a couple of dirty bucks.

1236
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:48,310
That's all it cost to buy me.
That's what she thought.

1237
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,710
Found out a little different, didn't she?

1238
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:54,918
Maybe I could get tired of being
pushed around by cops and hotel managers

1239
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,195
and ritzy dames in bungalows.

1240
01:33:57,440 --> 01:34:00,318
Maybe I could cost a little something,
just for once.

1241
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,992
And if I do end up on a slab...

Boy, am I sunk.

1244
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:17,751
- And that was one of the easy ones.
- We must be getting old.

1245
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:20,877
I felt kind of sorry for the old gent at that.

1246
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:28,075
- Thanks, Bill.
- You're welcome, Mrs Harwood. Good night.

1247
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:31,754
We seem to be saying good-bye again.

1248
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:35,232
It won't be so difficult this time, I guess.

1249
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:39,949
Last night when I made myself
walk out on you, remember?

1250
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:43,357
I said every guy had seen you before.
Somewhere.

1251
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:46,832
- I remember.
- But the trick was to find you.

1252
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:51,715
I remember that, too.
Do you think I'd ever forget it?

1253
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,599
Let's go find someplace
where we can get a drink, huh?

1254
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:07,150
- We got to wait for Johnny.
- We got to wait for Johnny?
