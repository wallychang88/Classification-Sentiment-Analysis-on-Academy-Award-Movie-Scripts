1
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,670
That away, yes, sir. That's one.

2
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,630
Let's go, boy. Let's go, baby.

3
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,262
Come on then. Check to him.

4
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,683
Man: Go, go, go!

5
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:31,772
Safe!

6
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,691
That's it. Come on.

7
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,144
Pitch it in.

8
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,237
Man: Run, run, run!

9
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,321
Fair ball!

10
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:50,705
Fair ball? That ball was foul, you blind son of a bitch!

11
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,332
It was that side of the tree!

12
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,708
By 5 yards that ball was foul!

13
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,882
What the hell do we have a tree for?

14
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,583
Why do we have a tree

15
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,886
if the ball falls 5 yards that side,

16
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,884
and you still call it fair?

17
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,306
Give me my ball.

18
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,806
Give me my kid... huh?

19
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,761
If you've finished trampling on him, that is.

20
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:13,484
Oh, right.

21
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,527
Thank you.

22
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,400
Come on.

23
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,228
There you go, pal.

24
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,409
You all right?

25
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,983
Can I have my ball? What?

26
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,659
You're holding my ball.

27
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,237
Oh, your ball.

28
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,197
Thanks. Any time.

29
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,263
What about your ball?

30
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,932

Oh. Share it?

55
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,329
Why not?

56
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,792
Man: Where to?

57
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,297
Where to?

58
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,548
80 grovenor street, please.

59
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,379
Lady's going to 80 grovenor street.

60
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,714
I'll be going on.

61
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:53,391
That is exactly 60 pence with the tip.

62
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,513
Forget it.

63
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,541
It's the right amount. I take this trip every day.

64
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:57,805
Not necessary.

65
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,312
How kind. I'll buy a house in the country.

66
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
Terrible weather.

67
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,520
Oh, filthy.

68
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,606
If you live in London, you have to expect it.

69
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,441
Do you live in London?

70
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,901
- I do. - Me too.

71
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,076
Really? Five years.

72
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,199
Good lord. Practically a native.

73
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,283
Last habitable city in the world, London; Wouldn't you say?

74
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,460
Yes, I would.

75
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,398
You can do anything you like. Nobody bothers you.

76
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,537
No.

77
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,130
My name is Steven Blackburn.

78
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,173
Vickie Allessio.

79
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,261
Oh, sounds Italian.

80
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,801
It's my husband's name.

81
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,992
Were those your kids in the park?

82
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,131
Yes.

83
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,225
Nice-looking little boys.

84
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,801
Thank you, but one of those little boys is a little girl.

85
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,978
Oh, I see.

86
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,521
I suppose your husband likes to sleep late on Sundays.

87
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,065
Yes, he does.

88
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,144
I suppose you like to go home and cook him a nice breakfast.

89
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,523
No.

90
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,775
Don't you like to cook?

91
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,302
I love to cook. Doesn't he like to eat?

92
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,941
He loves to eat.

93
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,151
I-I don't understand.

94
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,952
We have different kitchens... His is in Milan.

95
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,114
That's a shame.

96
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,073
Please don't cry. He found another cook.

97
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,955
Oh.

98
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,794
Thank you very much.

99
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,296
Mrs. Allessio?

100
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,298
You have a very good memory.

101
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,254
What about tea? “When?

102
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,260
Tomorrow?

103
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,261
Fine.

104
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,352
The Churchill.

105
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,305
Oh, great. See you then.

106
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,306
What time?

107
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,397
Um, 4:00.

108
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,726
You sure it won't break up your day?

109
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,433
Don't cross-examine me in the rain.

110
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,861
I'll be there wet, but I'll be there.

111
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,004
Steven:

112
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,956
Just a second, Terry. Good afternoon.

113
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,654
How about lunch tomorrow? We haven't had tea yet.

114
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,543
If I can change one appointment,

115
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,753
I can be clear.

116
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:56,260
I know nothing about you, except you play baseball.

117
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,841
And from the way you played,

118
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,551
you obviously don't do that for a living.

119
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,604
I'm in insurance, I'm married,

120
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,898
I have two kids, and I'm a Leo.

121
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,270
What about lunch tomorrow???

122
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,192
I think we ought to see how tea goes.

123
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,645
See how tea goes.

124
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,189
I'll talk to you later, Derek.

125
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,202
Who's Derek?

126
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,197
Derek is my male secretary.

127
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,838
Tea for two, please.

128
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,840
And what do you do?

129
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,262
I'm in the rag trade.

130
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,509
Ah, buy or sell?

131
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,885
I steal.

132
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,634
Steal?

133
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,313
I steal designs from Dior, Cardin, Givenchy,

134
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,357
and I send them to my boss Mr. Sam Fingleman of New York,

135
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:50,857
who makes them up in very cheap materials.

136
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,357
Sounds like very creative work.

137
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,449
Thank you.

138
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,989
Where'd you learn that, Paris?

139
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,691
No, Italy. I took a course in Milan.

140
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,243
Enter Mr. Allessio, also in the rag trade.

141
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,414
No, he specialized in charm. It comes easy to Italians.

142
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,583
We were married for several years

143
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,080
and had two children and three cars,

144
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,958
and he kept the cars.

145
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,289
What about child support?

146
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,090
He won't send me anything for the kids

147
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,965
if I don't send him something for the cars.

148
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,387
What about your wife?

149
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,760
Good-looking, bright, articulate.

150
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,807
She can start a fire with two pieces of wood.

151
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,164
We've been married for 11 years,

152
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,473
and not once in all that time

153
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,522
have I ever been unfaithful to her in the same city.

154
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:28,689
Where is she now?

155
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,860
Out of town. What about lunch?

156
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,652
What do you have in mind? Just lunch.

157
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,525
Where?

158
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,052
I know a cute little continental restaurant.

159
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,076
Italian?

160
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,650
Yeah, continental.

161
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,701
It's discreet, out of the way.

162
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,745
It's sort of a hotel.

163
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,327
It's Avery nice hotel.

164
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,283
It's got good food, great wine...

165
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,164
It's... l mean... it's... it's...

166
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,291
Oh, what the hell? A girl has to eat.

167
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,726
It's difficult to steal in France

168
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:15,528
because they expect you to steal.

169
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,615
Waiter.

170
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,734
I'm boring you.

171
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,441
Not at all.

172
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,276
Why are you asking for the check?

173
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,531
I would've liked coffee.

174
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,828
Of course.

175
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,827
It's just that, um, I've got this friend,

176
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,658
and he's got this little, um...

177
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,584
Little place upstairs.

178
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,038
I thought we'd have some coffee

179
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,133
and a little, uh...

180
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,217
Cognac?

181
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,791
You've been there before.

182
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,797
I'm wildly guessing.

183
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,220
Well, shall we?

184
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,387
Why not?

185
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,763
Why pay for something when you can get it for free?

186
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:46,934
Hmm?

187
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,763
I didn't mean that to sound the way it sounded.

188
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,769
Please forget I ever said it.

189
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,100
Certainly.

190
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,434
Where do I go?

191
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,529
This way.

192
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,319
Thank you.

193
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,568
Thank you, sir.

194
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,178
Steven: How long have you been divorced?

195
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,906
About 6 months.

196
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,534
You had 2 kids in the first 3 years?

197
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,081
I had 2 kids in the first 2 years.

198
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,705
Was he Catholic?

199
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:14,458
No, he wasn't Catholic, and I wasn't careless.

200
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,790
I just wanted those kids, but I don't know,

201
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:20,218
it all suddenly became extremely finis.

202
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,966
Then why'd you keep his name?

203
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,762
It was the only thing he was giving away.

204
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,806
My God, you ask a lot of questions.

205
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,431
People either hate it or love it.

206
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,806
It's about 70/30.

207
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,434
Milk and sugar?

208
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,981
Sugar, please. Sugar.

209
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,399
You know, it's a funny thing...

210
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,226
I can always tell about people.

211
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,984
I know immediately when I'm relating to someone.

212
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,440
I felt it right away with you.

213
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,400
Do you feel it?

214
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,454
Well, I... l must be feeling something.

215
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,781
Otherwise, why am I sitting here

216
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:50,994
when I should be out stealing

217
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,625
"Saint Laurent's" new Autumn line?

218
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,872
Exactly.

219
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,171
Can I say something to you?

220
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,839
In the past two days,

221
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,154
you have picked me up in the rain,

222
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,043
given me tea, bought me lunch,

223
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,298
and lured me to this hideaway

224
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,051
with the intention of getting me into bed

225
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,599
for what you Americans so charmingly call a quickie.

226
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,017
Is that a fair resume so far?

227
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,227
Why do women always think the worst?

228
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,853
Why does sex always have to be the first thing... yes.

229
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,631
Well, I'll be honest with you...

230
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,192
I'm a divorced woman, I'm under a lot of strain,

231
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,738
I am not sleeping too well,

232
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,692
and I could do with some uninvolved sex

233
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,277
with someone who loves his wife

234
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,532
and isn't going to be a pain in the ass when it's over.

235
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,538
This must be your lucky day.

236
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:35,210
Not in this overworked little joy station

237
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,582
where the sheets haven't been changed in a week.

238
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,757
I have to be back in my office in half an hour.

239
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,710
If you would like to arrange a nice weekend somewhere,

240
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:47,047
away from London, preferably in the sun,

241
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,256
please do.

242
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,218
I would be very happy to go with you.

243
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,145
Say something. Is it adeal?

244
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,187
Probably do us both a world of good.

245
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,935
You rather more than me.

246
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,361
Terribly sorry. It's all right.

247
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,188
I have another one.

248
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,886
Anything special, Derek?

249
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,933
Uh, no, not really.

250
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,637
Just the weekly sarcastic note from New York.

251
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:36,792
Donnelly is still wondering

252
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,181
why Paris keeps running ahead of us

253
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,891
on sales and adjustments.

254
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,477
Also, Braithwaite took his usual upside-down look

255
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,572
at this lot,

256
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,147
and started measuring your chair size.

257
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,948
Anything else?

258
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,071
Isn't that enough?

259
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,162
Would you mind getting me

260
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,862
one of those continental weather reports?

261
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,618
Continental weather report.

262
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:55,709
Yeah.

263
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,039
Oh.

264
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,249
Excuse me.

265
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,955
Uh...

266
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,633
What?

267
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,060
Oh. Come in.

268
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,147
Good afternoon.

269
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,274
Got a surprise.

270
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,359
What?

271
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,525
I've arranged us a week in Spain.

272
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,104
Could you just move? Because I'm trying to sketch,

273
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,531
and I can't actually see through you.

274
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,654
A week? I said a weekend.

275
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,078
You can't just spend a weekend in Spain.

276
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,655
Who's going to look after my children?

277
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,661
Who's going to run this place?

278
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,289
You'll love it... Warm winds, great food,

279
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,291
buffet right by the swimming pool,

280
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,839
big soft towels...

281
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,041
You can see Gibraltar.

282
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,797
I would adore to see Gibraltar,

283
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,878
but I have a dog that needs exercise,

284
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,304
a cat that is losing its hair,

285
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,177
and a model who can't stand straight.

286
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,599
Maggie, please.

287
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,553
There are no problems that we cannot overcome.

288
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,146
Why aren't you at the airport?

289
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,564
Because, my dear Mrs. Allessio,

290
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,651
I am only mortal.

291
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:45,895
I'm not "Apollo".

292
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,353
God gave me hands, not wings.

293
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,448
What an oversight.

294
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,648
Just sign it. I've got a car waiting.

295
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,404
Hello, I'm Cecil Fleurmat. Steven Blackburn.

296
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,656
Buying or selling? Begging.

297
00:15:56,747 --> 00:16:00,239
A customs declaration should be typed.

298
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,790
It'd take forever, sweetie pie.

299
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,745
I only type with one finger, and I've hurt it.

300
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,750
Please don't tell me how.

301
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,707
Vickie, there's a long-distance call for you.

302
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,008
It's New York.

303
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,303
Here, get that to the airport.

304
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,550
Teatime, Maggie.

305
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,348
Sam, how are you?

306
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,846
No, I'm fine. Yes.

307
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,393
No. Let them run the ad.

308
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,938
They'll be there 11:00 your time.

309
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,357
Listen, Sam, are you standing up?

310
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,400
Well, then sit down because I know you very well,

311
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,688
and what I'm about to say will get you terribly excited.

312
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,651
Guess where I'm going tomorrow? Spain.

313
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,073
- Marbella. - Marbella.

314
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,366
It's near Malaga.

315
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,365
It's near Malaga.

316
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,992
No, no, I'm not going alone.

317
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,370
I'm going with a fella, a very classy fella.

318
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,043
That doesn't make you excited?

319
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,415
Oh, you're getting old

320
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,418
because it excites the hell out of me.

321
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,465
Yes, I will. I will do that.

322
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,383
Yes, goodbye.

323
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,383
I told him you're a classy fellow. Are you?

324
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,307
Got to be. I live around the corner from disraell.

325
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,939
There we are. Thank you.

326
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,189
Come on, Josie.

327
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,987
Well, here we are at last.

328
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,155
Gently does it, Gloria.

329
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,358
Thanks, daddy.

330
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,317
Don't you think we should've wired Steve

331
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,412
we were coming?

332
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:24,708
Why spoil his fun? This way, he'll have a lovely surprise.

333
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:41,800
Good afternoon.

334
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,431
I'm Miss Ramos. Can I help you, sir?

335
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,058
My name is Blackburn.

336
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,434
Reservations... 2 round trip tickets to Malaga,

337
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:49,811
night flight tonight.

338
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,939
Thank you, Mr. Blackburn. I'll just check.

339
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,866
The seats are available, sir.

340
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:01,319
Oh. Charge mine to my travel card.

341
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,950
I'll pay for the other one in cash.

342
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,702
Why not charge both tickets, Mr. Blackburn?

343
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,455
See, this is a business card.

344
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,628
I charge my ticket to the business.

345
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:11,715
They pay for it,

346
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,041
and the other is a surprise vacation trip for my mother.

347
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,218
What is your mother's name?

348
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:20,263
Vickie. Vickie Allessio.

349
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,634
Allessio?

350
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:24,263
She remarried. I'll get the tickets.

351
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,858
Here you are, sir...

352
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,901
One for Mr. Blackburn and one for Mrs. Allessio.

353
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,571
Oh, I'll take that. I'm Mrs. Allessio.

354
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:41,943
Happy mother's day.

355
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,496
Just tell me one thing.

356
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,297
Why do you have to leave tonight,

357
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:59,093
on the very day mommy and daddy arrive for a visit?

358
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,922
When the S.S. Saramigoso rammed into the S.S. Antonio,

359
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:05,508
ripping out its double-headed corkscrew turbine rotor shaft,

360
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,122
they didn't know about mommy and daddy's visit,

361
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,977
or I'm sure they would've avoided each other.

362
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,680
You could send braithwaite.

363
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:11,935
That's alli need now.

364
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:15,063
Why don't you both go down? We didn't come to see you.

365
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,145
We came to be with our babies.

366
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,481
I'd love that, grace, but Gloria hates the place.

367
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,637
She can't stand the wind, the food...

368
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,071
Isn't that right, dear?

369
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,778
We were there last September. It was miserable.

370
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,659
In July, it's gorgeous.

371
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,456
It really is. You'll enjoy it.

372
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,783
Ask her nice, Steve.

373
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,539
You might have yourself a pretty roommate.

374
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,461
Why not try it, dear?

375
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,834
Maybe in July it won't have the wind

376
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:40,009
and the lousy food and the heat and the flies.

377
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,552
Think I can still get a ticket?

378
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,595
And that's another thing... That's easy.

379
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,048
What are you flying? "Iberia".

380
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,142
Want me to call?

381
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,513
No, I'll get it.

382
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,687
- You know the number? - Yes. Yes, I do.

383
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,311
If you have any problems, I know Valdez very well.

384
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:56,939
He runs the outfit. He'd be glad to help you.

385
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,520
If I need him, I'll call him.

386
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,573
Hello, iberia, this is Mr. Blackburn.

387
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,151
I made a reservation...

388
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,736
Miss Ramos: Hello, this is Miss Ramos.

389
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:07,866
Oh, you're still on.

390
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,323
Yes, our night girl got sick.

391
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:13,581
I need one more ticket on your Malaga flight.

392
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:14,671
It's for Mrs. Blackburn.

393
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,962
Your grandmother? My wife.

394
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,833
We can confirm that reservation,

395
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:21,928
Mr. Blackburn.

396
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,469
The party will be you, your wife,

397
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,922
and your mother.

398
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,802
Thank you, Miss Ramos.

399
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,976
Well...

400
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,349
That's that.

401
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,931
Come on, dear,

402
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,141
we'd better pack.

403
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,319
Just close the door, please.

404
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,987
Come on, dog. Quick, quick.

405
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,781
"Si" a lovely ride in the car 

406
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,201
in you go. All right, cat.

407
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,279
Good.

408
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,426
Oh, dog, when are you going to learn to walk?

409
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,969
Oh...

410
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,638
God, you're heavy.

411
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:09,841
Oh...

412
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,516
Are you a mad thing? What are you doing?

413
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:15,472
My mother is allergic to cats, dogs, and birds.

414
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:16,566
See you next week.

415
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,062
But I've got a dog and a cat and a bird.

416
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,235
Then you'll have 2 dogs, 2 cats, and 2 birds.

417
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,062
You'll have 2 of everything, Cecil.

418
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:24,488
Are they housebroken?

419
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,154
I can only vouch for the bird.

420
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,577
Oh, my god.

421
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,826
Come along, shim.

422
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,676
- Gloria. - Mm-hm?

423
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:47,804
Have I ever criticized you

424
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,429
about the way you raise the children?

425
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,178
No. Never.

426
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,055
This time I think you're blowing it.

427
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,058
We're going to come back to two really screwed-up kids.

428
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,105
You know what your folks are like...

429
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:00,754
Bicycles for this, roller skates for that.

430
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,484
They bribe them for affection.

431
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,857
Remember when Billy came back from a month with them?

432
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,861
The kid wouldn't smile until I gave him $3.

433
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:10,489
There's a time when you think of yourself,

434
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,491
and there's a time when you think of the children.

435
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,290
What's iberia's number?

436
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:17,662
I'll do it, dear.

437
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,462
I suppose there is only one practical solution.

438
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,168
That's right.

439
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,637
Hello, "Iberia"? Miss Ramos?

440
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,134
We'll take the kids with us.

441
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:35,639
This is Mr. Blackburn, and we'll take the kids with us.

442
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,094
Take the kids with us?

443
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,268
You're right. They'll be better off with us.

444
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,815
Are you serious?

445
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,314
I'll make some excuse to mommy and daddy.

446
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,985
Well, make the reservation, darling.

447
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,037
Miss Ramos, I'd like to add two to that party...

448
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,955
My son and my daughter.

449
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,080
They're just little children, miss ramos.

450
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,035
Do you take little children that late at night?

451
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:03,586
Oh, you do.

452
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:07,292
Yes, Mr. Blackburn, and I can confirm that for you now.

453
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,546
Thank you.

454
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,174
Right.

455
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,092
We've just been confirmed.

456
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,551
Oh, good.

457
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,637
And please make sure they clean their teeth.

458
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,097
Bye.

459
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,524
It's the airport, please.

460
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:27,024
Maria, get the children up and packed.

461
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,650
We're taking them to marbella.

462
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,356
Maria, lay out their beach things.

463
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:34,694
I'll check it all out in a moment, okay?

464
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,280
I'll go help Maria. Just a second.

465
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,117
Hello, "Iberia"? Miss Ramos? This is Mr. Blackburn again.

466
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,826
I want 2 more seats...

467
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,755
For a Mr. and Mrs. Wendell Thompson.

468
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,332
Yes, my father-in-law and my mother-in-law.

469
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,338
What are you doing?

470
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,157
You don't think they came all the way to England

471
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,763
to give up a chance to spoil their grandchildren, do you?

472
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,557
They're going to be down on the next plane.

473
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,352
Oh, god, it's turning into a pilgrimage.

474
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:01,936
I know.

475
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,352
You better go down alone.

476
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,980
I think that makes sense, dear.

477
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,982
Miss Ramos, cancel my mother-in-law,

478
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,938
my father-in-law, my wife, and my children.

479
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,524
Just you and mother.

480
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,238
Roger.

481
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,791
You free?

482
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,793
Um, it's "Iberia". There's a lot.

483
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,170
If you went around, it might be easier.

484
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,876
- How much do I owe you? - 2 quids.

485
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,259
Goodbye. Bye.

486
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,931
Thanks very much. Cheers.

487
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:03,453
Hey, Steve! Steve!

488
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,876
Over here, it's Walter.

489
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,499
Steve: Hello, Walter.

490
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,750
How you doing?

491
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,207
Where you headed? Malaga?

492
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,541
Yeah. So am I.

493
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,251
Who you with?

494
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,882
Nobody.

495
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:18,134
Good. We'll sit together on the plane.

496
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,262
- Oh, swell. Walter: That's terrific.

497
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,560
I hate to sit with strangers on a plane.

498
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,558
They try to tell you the story of their life.

499
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,514
They really annoy you.

500
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,654
Gloria all right?

501
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,331
Fine, great. And the children?

502
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,704
Children are great, great, great.

503
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,410
Say, look, Steve, while I got you here,

504
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,316
there is something I wanted to talk to you about.

505
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,251
I got this screenplay ready to shoot.

506
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,957
It's a western with "weirdos".

507
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,714
Got these "Apaches", see,

508
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,385
and they start sucking this "peyote" root.

509
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,929
Drives them all out of their gourds,

510
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,052
everyone starts banging everyone else.

511
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,179
It's got everything... Pot, sex, massacres, orgies.

512
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,806
You can take the whole family.

513
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,058
It's going to cost about $600,000.

514
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,460
Think Gloria's old man would like to go in

515
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,645
for a couple hundred thou?

516
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,278
What?

517
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,818
The picture... I just told you.

518
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:17,569
Oh, sorry, Walter, that's my deaf side.

519
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,775
Do you think Gloria's father would like

520
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,347
to invest a quarter of a million dollars

521
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,952
in my new picture? No.

522
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,280
Are you sure?

523
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,706
I'm positive, Walter. He's been approached before.

524
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:28,538
You know something?

525
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,836
I liked you better before, when you couldn't hear me.

526
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:39,594
Hl. Good evening.

527
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,718
I ordered a car, a Fiat 124.

528
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,218
Oh, yes, senior Blackburn.

529
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,554
If you'll complete the papers, I'll get the keys.

530
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,435
A Fiat 124 is really a Fiat.

531
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:52,858
Yes.

532
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,560
It's not a bad car. It will hold

533
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,236
all the luggage that you put into it.

534
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,483
Don't talk to me. What?

535
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,235
Don't look at me.

536
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,845
- What's the matter? - Walter: Hey, Steve-boy!

537
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:01,949
That's what's the matter.

538
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,117
Hi, Walter.

539
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,445
Son of a bitch.

540
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,156
Boy, you'd think those customs guys would know me by now.

541
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:08,866
What a mess. Excuse me, miss.

542
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,041
I beg your pardon.

543
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,245
Stand by, pal. I may need you.

544
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,920
I'm Walter Menkes of "Menkes films".

545
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,918
I'd like a Fiat 124.

546
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,842
Woman: I am very sorry, senior. We have not one car left.

547
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,295
Oh. Oh, you got a car.

548
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,929
- Huh? - A car.

549
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,016
Oh, yeah.

550
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,469
Good, you can give me a lift.

551
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:28,264
Oh, you can find him a car. He's a friend of mine.

552
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,291
What's the sweat? You drop me off at "Los Monteros".

553
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,252
- They've got cars. - Listen, it's right on your way.

554
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:33,336
Patty and the kids are waiting.

555
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,975
What about those cars out there?

556
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,276
They are all reserved, senior.

557
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,465
But you must have something.

558
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:41,232
We do have a Fiat "600" that has just been returned,

559
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,442
but I'm a little bit nervous about the clutch.

560
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,948
He'll take it. What do you mean?

561
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,279
Do you know what a "600" is?

562
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,434
Yeah, I know... it's a kiddie car.

563
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,868
- It's this big. - Oh, Walter.

564
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,121
You got to step outside to shift gears.

565
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,668
You don't drive it. You mail it.

566
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,875
You put it in the water, it becomes an outboard motor.

567
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:58,833
All right, Walter. You take my car.

568
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,667
I'll take the "600".

569
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,115
This is stupid. ...It's not stupid.

570
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,846
It is stupid. I'll drop you off.

571
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,594
We'll have a nice ride, pleasant talk.

572
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,142
It's no good, Walter. “Why not"?

573
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:14,891
I've got a trick back. If someone else drives,

574
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:16,475
it could easily go right into spasm.

575
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,935
Spasm? Spasm.

576
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:19,674
You know, you're a very sick fellow

577
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,904
with the ear and the spasms.

578
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,697
Walter, it's 2:00 in the morning.

579
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:25,571
I gotta drive 2 hours. Please take the car.

580
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:26,848
Can I at least buy you a meal?

581
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:27,987
Sure. Tonight?

582
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,622
Great. Dinner?

583
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,166
Fine. Why should you be alone?

584
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,537
Just you, me, Patty, and the boys.

585
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,293
We'll have a fun evening.

586
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,169
After dinner, I will read you the screenplay.

587
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,093
Oh, I look forward to it, Walter.

588
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,512
Uh, miss, can I give you a lift?

589
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,884
Thank you. I'm being met.

590
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,091
Oh.

591
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,106
You should go. It sounds like a lot of fun.

592
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,401
What is this?

593
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,194
Where do I sign?

594
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,521
Here.

595
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,179
Ever been in one of these?

596
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,410
In Italy when I was younger...

597
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:10,112
And shorter.

598
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,822
Can you manage this?

599
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,327
Yeah, on my knee. Anything else?

600
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,158
Well, there's this.

601
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,795
Thank you.

602
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,122
Thank you.

603
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,750
Now, remember, sir, if the clutch

604
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,530
gives you any trouble, you change in "Mar Villa".

605
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:25,589
I'll keep it in mind.

606
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,091
Have a pleasant trip.

607
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,798
Bye-bye. "Adios". Thank you.

608
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,265
That's second. It's an Italian gearbox.

609
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,224
Oh. Oh, thanks.

610
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,230
No, no, that's third. First is up here.

611
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,436
See, you...

612
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:43,862
Oh, I see. That's it.

613
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,031
Good thing you're here.

614
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,324
Ready? Yes.

615
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,617
Nervous? No.

616
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,194
That's my girl.

617
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,716
It's a nice little car. It spins right along.

618
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,543
You're still in first.

619
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,753
Oh, I see.

620
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:11,434
Use the clutch.

621
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,976
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

622
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,974
There's a car coming.

623
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,098
Okay.

624
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:24,691
There's a truck. It's trying to pass you.

625
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,902
Go around!

626
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,452
You're still in third.

627
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,158
Would you like to drive? No.

628
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,288
You're sure? Positive.

629
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,209
Good.

630
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,504
Besides, I didn't bring my license.

631
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,225
For God's sake.

632
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,554
You'd think there'd be a "porter" or something.

633
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,309
Hey, listen,

634
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,812
leave this stuff here, and I'll come back for it.

635
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,940
It's all right. I've always wanted long arms.

636
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,789
Are you all right?

637
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,340
Steve: I'm all right.

638
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:48,823
Good morning, sir.

639
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:52,274
My name is Blackburn. This is Mrs. Allessio.

640
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,200
We wanted a suite.

641
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,278
Moment, sir.

642
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,665
I am sorry, Mr. Blackburn,

643
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,744
but there's no reservation for a suite.

644
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,455
It's a room, a double room.

645
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:10,511
Any objections?

646
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,177
Anything, as long as it has a view of Gibraltar.

647
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,051
We will see Gibraltar?

648
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,053
Yes sir.

649
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,176
This way, please.

650
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:51,584
Just one moment, please. What is that?

651
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,884
What is what?

652
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,804
Does Gibraltar have washing hanging all over it?

653
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,301
What are you talking about?

654
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,008
Because if it doesn't, we don't have a view of Gibraltar.

655
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,968
What do we have a view of?

656
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,725
Roughly, I'd say the laundry.

657
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,477
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

658
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:09,150
They don't even have big laundries down here.

659
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,477
What is that out there?

660
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:11,937
It's the laundry.

661
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,693
It's the laundry.

662
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,399
I told you we want to see Gibraltar.

663
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:19,828
We want a room with a view of Gibraltar, comprende?

664
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,910
Yes sir.

665
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,402
What we'd like, senor,

666
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,981
is a room with a view and a toilet with a seat.

667
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:57,486
That's not asking too much, is it?

668
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,194
Vickie.

669
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:43,404
Hmm?

670
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:45,872
Why don't we unpack in the morning?

671
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:48,329
Aren't you tired?

672
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,001
Only of unpacking.

673
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,499
I see.

674
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,630
Very well.

675
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,737
Would you like that light on or off?

676
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,913
Whichever you prefer.

677
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:15,336
How about on? Certainly.

678
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,339
Would you do me a very big favor?

679
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,390
I thought that's what I was doing.

680
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,684
Would you mind getting on the other side?

681
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,558
What's wrong with this side?

682
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:35,482
Nothing. It's more natural for me being on that side.

683
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,935
I don't want to make an international incident,

684
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,895
but it's more natural for me this side.

685
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,355
We always started this way.

686
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,236
- We? - Me and my Italian.

687
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,988
You see, he had this tennis elbow

688
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,035
and a bad shoulder, and, anyway,

689
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:49,488
I just got used to this side.

690
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,118
It doesn't work for me.

691
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:58,757
Why not?

692
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:00,882
I'm deaf in my left ear.

693
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,381
What's that got to do with it?

694
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,573
I won't be able to hear you.

695
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,178
I'm not going to say very much.

696
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:08,257
You're going to breathe, aren't you, sometimes?

697
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,591
That sounds pretty good.

698
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:11,597
Who knows? A word of encouragement may slip out

699
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,599
at the right moment. It could do wonders.

700
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:15,733
What?

701
00:37:17,725 --> 00:37:17,819
Shall I walk around?

702
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,151
Oh, well, why don't you just slip over,

703
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,238
and I'll slide under?

704
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,278
No, I think it's better if I slip under,

705
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,606
and you slide over.

706
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:26,612
Why don't we just roll toward each other?

707
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,534
It's getting awfully late.

708
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,488
Why don't you just get on top and hope for the best?

709
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,704
Well, I've heard it put more romantically.

710
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,786
Indeed.

711
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,715
Christ, you're beautiful.

712
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:56,141
My god, you can see Gibraltar.

713
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,232
Where?

714
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:01,195
What's the matter?

715
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,019
Spasm. I'm in spasm. What?

716
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,194
What do you mean?

717
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,676
Either you're in spasm, or you're not in spasm,

718
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,700
and I'm in spasm.

719
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:07,865
- Oh, my god. - Oh, boy.

720
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,488
What do I do? I don't know.

721
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:11,194
I think you better call the doctor.

722
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,450
Yeah, get the doctor. Oh, don't move.

723
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,451
Please don't move.

724
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,895
How do I get the doctor if I don't move?

725
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:18,285
Very slowly, that's all. Very slowly.

726
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,960
Please calm down.

727
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,210
Oh, god.

728
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,591
Man on radio: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

729
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,765
Another beautiful day on the costa del sol...

730
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,680
Oh, god...

731
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:40,394
Look, I can't reach the phone.

732
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,395
If you can just...

733
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,772
Steve: Please. Please get the phone. Please.

734
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,979
I've got the phone, I've got the phone.

735
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,564
Ow.

736
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,232
Help!

737
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,908
What's "doctor" in Spanish?

738
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,077
What is Spanish for "doctor"?

739
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,405
The Doctor.

740
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,500
Are you sure?

741
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,949
I think so. It sounds Italian.

742
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,080
Well, maybe it's Italian. It's foreign.

743
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:01,713
You tell them.

744
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,914
Please, please, I'm in spasm.

745
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,340
Could you... Could you send a doctor?

746
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:09,215
Man: Easy, easy.

747
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,011
Gently, gently.

748
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,307
Now, what precisely were you doing

749
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:16,510
when this thing happened?

750
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,896
Well, I..l was just sort of...

751
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,648
We were making love.

752
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,022
We were making love.

753
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:29,447
So in the middle of making love with this woman,

754
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:32,822
you turned to see Gibraltar, "si"?

755
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,118
"Si".

756
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,570
I see.

757
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:41,668
Now I am going to turn you over, so relax.

758
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:45,121
Very gently, gently.

759
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,128
It's coming, it's coming.

760
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,427
Relax. That's it. Would you give me a hand with the foot?

761
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,799
A hand with the foot?

762
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,802
Yes, give him a hand with the foot.

763
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:55,893
Thank you.

764
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,183
Now very gently.

765
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,477
Relax, relax.

766
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:07,894
How do you feel?

767
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,730
Better.

768
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,899
Better.

769
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:13,994
Good.

770
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,490
Now you can put him back in the bed.

771
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,489
Thank you.

772
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,120
All right.

773
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,211
Okay, easy.

774
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,037
Oh.

775
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:27,914
Vickie: How's that?

776
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,421
Give him this.

777
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,511
This?

778
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:32,756
To sleep.

779
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,337
To sleep.

780
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,592
Rest good,

781
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,265
and do not try to make love again

782
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:39,638
until you can touch your toes.

783
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,602
Touch my toes?

784
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,270
Like this.

785
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,399
Then everything will be all right.

786
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,946
Bye.

787
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,443
Bye. Bye.

788
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,525
Bye. Vickie: Thanks.

789
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,485
Doctor: Bye. Steve: Bye.

790
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,695
Vickie: Thanks.

791
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,030
Thank you.

792
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,457
Can I have the pills, please?

793
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,578
How are you enjoying the trip so far?

794
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:09,085
Nice, nice.

795
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,708
That's what I thought.

796
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:16,262
Mmm. Oh.

797
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,757
Aren't you going to get under the covers?

798
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,310
No.

799
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:27,061
Nice, nice.

800
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,870
Boy: Mom, come on, get me one of these.

801
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:43,414
All the guys have one.

802
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,163
Woman: No, no, no, no, no.

803
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,119
Boy: Why not, mom?

804
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,459
Excuse me. Do you speak english?

805
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,966
I try, but I'm an American.

806
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,967
Well, I have a son about the same size as yours.

807
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,119
Could I borrow him for a minute?

808
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:01,929
Oh, you can have him all day if you want to.

809
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,387
Thanks very much. Do you mind? Thank you.

810
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,142
Are you British? Yes.

811
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,313
From London?

812
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,266
Me, too. We've been living there for years.

813
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,817
What did you say your name was?

814
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:15,772
Well, I didn't, but it's Allessio, Vickie Allessio. Thanks.

815
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,074
Where are you staying? ..."Guadalmina".

816
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:19,822
Maybe you and Mr. Allessio

817
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,868
would have dinner with my husband and me.

818
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,142
Well, that's very kind of you,

819
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:26,033
but I'm afraid I'm right out of Mr. Allessios.

820
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:28,789
Oh, well, hey, are you here alone?

821
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,495
Um, yes, yes.

822
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,796
That makes it easier.

823
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,716
Well, it doesn't actually, you see, because...

824
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:35,802
Thank you...

825
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,377
I'm here for sort of a rest.

826
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:40,384
And I'm on a diet, and, well, you know how it is.

827
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:42,466
Thanks for the use of the chest. Bye-bye.

828
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,016
Oh, Mrs. Allessio.

829
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,218
How do you spell that?

830
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,679
2 I's, 2 s's, and I'm out a lot.

831
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:52,059
Nerd!

832
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:41,236
Hello.

833
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:45,862
How are you feeling?

834
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,871
I can touch my toes.

835
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,574
Can you?

836
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,414
Oh.

837
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,463
Oh.

838
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,636
You do realize I have just greased myself

839
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,931
with two tubes of very expensive suntan oil?

840
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,633
I couldn't help noticing.

841
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,264
Mmm.

842
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:14,895
Pardon me for asking, but did you always

843
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,692
get what you want when you wanted it?

844
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:19,020
Even before I knew what to do with it.

845
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:31,203
Listen, if we're going to eat, and I really think we...

846
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:33,831
Are you still asleep?

847
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,913
I feel marvelous.

848
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,794
I fell asleep before I could say thanks.

849
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:40,091
Oh.

850
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,168
How do you feel?

851
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:45,888
Fine, but they do stop serving lunch in 10 minutes.

852
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,431
- Everything okay? - Mmm-hmm.

853
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,438
I booked a table, but you know what they're like.

854
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:52,519
You know what I mean. How was it for you?

855
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,024
Very nice.

856
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,065
Very nice? Yes.

857
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,360
Just very nice?

858
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,688
Well, what's wrong with very nice?

859
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,743
Well, "very nice" is hardly the phrase

860
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,867
to describe two bodies locked in heavenly transport.

861
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,561
You wouldn't chisel "very nice" in granite

862
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:14,075
under rodin's "the kiss."

863
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,252
"Very nice" is when you receive a get-well card

864
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:18,170
from your butcher or the television repairman.

865
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,623
That's very nice, but for what we just did,

866
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,960
the operational comments range from "lousy" to "sensational,"

867
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,657
"the rockets went off," or "the earth moved."

868
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:29,390
Oh, for god's sake. These things take time.

869
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:30,967
This is a body, not a machine.

870
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:32,472
You don't just press a button,

871
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,930
and pow! The earth moves. =it moved for me.

872
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:37,981
Well, lucky you.

873
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,651
My god, you're all the same...

874
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,775
This obsession with male sexual prowess.

875
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,356
It's so typically American.

876
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,691
Oh, is it?

877
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:48,822
It is, if you don't mind me telling you.

878
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:51,029
I don't mind you telling me, not a bit.

879
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,988
It's just that phrase I can't stand,

880
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,290
"typically American." Why not?

881
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:56,538
There's no such thing as typically American.

882
00:45:57,797 --> 00:45:59,082
It's a big place, America.

883
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,013
Which typically American Americans do you mean,

884
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,457
the cab drivers in New York?

885
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,291
The coal miners in Pennsylvania?

886
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:05,547
The students at Berkeley?

887
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:08,254
The mormons in Utah, the Harlem globetrotters?

888
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,118
How about the daughters of the American revolution?

889
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,222
Are those the ones you mean? I'll tell you something.

890
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,870
They're all throwing rocks at each other.

891
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,290
The only thing that's typically American

892
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,646
about the 200 million Americans is that they never

893
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,475
do anything typically alike, and that goes for humping, too.

894
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:21,649
You ought to know that.

895
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:22,977
Well, of course.

896
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:25,609
I've had it off with all 200 million of them!

897
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,156
Don't be an idiot.

898
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:30,534
Why are you so angry? The earth moved for you.

899
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:33,158
I've never seen anyone change so fast in my whole life.

900
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:34,409
I haven't changed.

901
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,333
I'm the same sweet sex-crazed typical American

902
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,002
I was 20 minutes ago.

903
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:42,375
And just remember this...

904
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,424
There is no better way for amanto start the day

905
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:48,503
than with that bracing, glowing, ego-building feeling

906
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:51,760
of knowing that he has just struck out in the sack.

907
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:54,684
"Struck out in the sack," is, I assume,

908
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:59,013
a mixed metaphor, undoubtedly American, and probably nasty.

909
00:46:59,108 --> 00:46:59,938
It'll do.

910
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:02,358
And may I point out, as you have never noticed

911
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:04,310
women are different from men?

912
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:06,316
They require time, a little sensitivity.

913
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:07,567
English women.

914
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,023
All women!

915
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:13,487
Anybody but a superannuated boy scout would know that.

916
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:14,912
End of conversation!

917
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:16,990
- Ha! - Oh, boy.

918
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,824
"Oh, boy," what?

919
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:19,999
Nothing.

920
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,957
It just takes time to know a person.

921
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:27,542
It certainly does.

922
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,627
Time and trouble.

923
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:32,008
Lots of time and lots of trouble.

924
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,885
Right. Do you want lunch?

925
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,807
Just a sandwich. I'm going to play golf.

926
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:37,226
Good. I'll trail along.

927
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:38,393
You don't have to.

928
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:41,223
No, but I can use the exercise.

929
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:44,150
I'll say. God knows you didn't get any this morning.

930
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,694
Okay, Enrique, $100 for the first nine,

931
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:35,071
$100 for the second, and $100 for the 18.

932
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,368
- Understands? - Yes sir.

933
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,741
- "Mucho bene". - I shall win, though.

934
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:46,086
Are you gambling with this child?

935
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,173
It's not gambling.

936
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:48,794
These kids have a lot of Spanish pride.

937
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,612
So instead of tipping him, ilet him win a little.

938
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,172
Oh, so he wins, does he?

939
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:53,753
Yeah, if he can.

940
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:55,088
I see.

941
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:58,974
What is that supposed to mean?

942
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,767
What is what supposed to mean?

943
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:03,562
"I see." That supercilious cold-assed english way

944
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:04,934
of saying "I see."

945
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,061
It means I'm delighted the boy has a chance to win.

946
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:08,513
I would hate to witness a spectacle

947
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:11,233
of a grown man who has to beat an 8-year-old.

948
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:14,360
He's 13, he smokes, goes with a flamenco dancer,

949
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:15,817
and he gives me 2 shots aside.

950
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,026
Be.

951
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,603
You going to count that? You play 4.

952
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,629
She was talking.

953
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:29,080
You lie 3. You play 4.

954
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,427
You know, winning is not that important, Enrique.

955
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,220
You learn that as you go through life.

956
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:42,389
That's right, Enrique. It's how you play the game.

957
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:55,818
Nice shot.

958
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,410
Nice shot.

959
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:05,867
Vickie: Alright.

960
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,576
Try and stay off the green, will you?

961
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:17,845
What is it?

962
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:19,422
My cousins would like to bet on me.

963
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:22,384
- Your cousins? - "Si"

964
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:23,684
- starting from here? - "Si".

965
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,636
- $100, $100, $1007? - "Si".

966
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,209
And they're going to give me two shots aside?

967
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:29,519
- "Si". - Okay, it's their money.

968
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:46,040
Enrique: Senior, my cousins' friends would like to bet on me.

969
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,063
Steve: Your cousins' friends would like to bet on you?

970
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:49,814
- Enrique: "Si". - Steve: Same action as before?

971
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,625
- Enrique: "Si". - Steve: Okay, kid.

972
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:58,805
Enrique: Hey, senior.

973
00:50:58,889 --> 00:50:59,889
Steve: What is it?

974
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:02,636
Enrique: My cousins' friends' cousins would like to bet on me.

975
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,637
Steve: Your cousins' friends' cousins?

976
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,331
- Enrique: "Si". Steve: Same action as before?

977
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:07,355
Enrique: Yes.

978
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:09,680
Steve: Okay, kid. Get out the way you got in.

979
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:31,929
Vale.

980
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:45,370
Yeah!

981
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:50,458
Excuse me.

982
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,503
Steve: Hey, fellows, what are you doing?

983
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:01,594
What's all this?

984
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,135
Here is your money.

985
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,717
Ah, forget it. I just got lucky.

986
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:09,300
You win a few, you lose a few. Here.

987
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:13,099
Buy the boys a drink.

988
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,680
See you later.

989
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:26,950
What's bugging you now?

990
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,278
Apart from the fact that you're still in second?

991
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:30,658
Yeah.

992
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:31,749
All right, I'll tell you.

993
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:33,853
This isn't a romantic holiday. It's approving ground.

994
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,717
I think you brought me here for the same reason

995
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:37,752
you had to beat that little child.

996
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,080
- You do, huh? - I do, "huh".

997
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,174
I also have a feeling

998
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:41,653
that your wife gives you two shots aside,

999
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:43,759
and she doesn't walk off feeling too happy, either.

1000
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:46,588
Yeah? Since I came here with you

1001
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:48,642
and not "Sigmund Freud", which was my 1st mistake,

1002
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:49,994
I've had all the amateur analysis

1003
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,634
I intend to take. Is that clear?

1004
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,766
Perfectly, and you're still in second.

1005
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:08,430
Look, I'm going down to malaga

1006
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:09,514
to take care of my business.

1007
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:12,154
I figure I'll eat out... alone.

1008
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,077
You'll enjoy the company.

1009
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:23,882
Walter: Hey, Steve.

1010
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,209
I just called your room.

1011
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:27,920
I wanted to find out if you're still free tonight.

1012
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:29,015
I sure am.

1013
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,306
Good. Antonio's at the port, at 8:30.

1014
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,599
Good. See you then.

1015
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:33,971
Okay. Where are you going?

1016
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,062
Business.

1017
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:36,666
Oh. How's the clutch?

1018
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,100
- What? - The clutch!

1019
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:39,773
Fine. Okay.

1020
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:47,450
Hello.

1021
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:48,990
Woman: Miss Allessio? Yes.

1022
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:51,318
This is the lady you met this morning, remember?

1023
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,349
The one with the little boy. You borrowed his chest.

1024
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,613
Yes. How are you?

1025
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,824
I was wondering if you'd go to dinner

1026
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:58,159
with my husband and me tonight.

1027
00:54:58,212 --> 00:55:00,043
That would be very nice.

1028
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,291
Great. We'll pick you up about 8:15.

1029
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,418
I look forward to it.

1030
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,317
Good evening, sir. Mr. Menkes' table.

1031
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:36,162
Hey, Steve. Steve, over here.

1032
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:37,583
Hello, Walter.

1033
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:43,798
Sorry I'm late.

1034
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:44,882
It's all right.

1035
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:46,707
- Hello, Patty. - Hiya, Steve.

1036
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:48,008
How are you?

1037
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:50,256
Walter: Steve, this is Vickie Allessio.

1038
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,838
You two are in the same hotel.

1039
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:54,298
Vickie, this is Steve Blackburn.

1040
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:55,678
Mr. Blackburn.

1041
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:57,718
Mrs. Allessio.

1042
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,653
Well, we're off and running,

1043
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,321
but you got to be careful.

1044
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:12,070
He's a slow starter, but he finishes fast,

1045
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,900
so watch yourself. “Wally.

1046
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:16,408
Huh? What's wrong?

1047
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:17,818
They're two healthy, normal people

1048
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:18,875
down here on their own.

1049
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:21,200
No ties, no responsibilities.

1050
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:22,956
It makes your mouth water.

1051
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,411
Wally.

1052
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:27,323
What would you like to have to drink?

1053
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:31,385
Whatever Mr. Blackburn would like. Whatever Miss Allessio would like.

1054
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,881
Well, what about sangria?

1055
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:34,493
Walter: Yeah, they say sangria's great.

1056
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:36,674
Lovely. Fine.

1057
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,679
"Camariery"?

1058
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:42,054
It's very Spanish and we're here.

1059
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:52,064
Could I have some water, please?

1060
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:55,447
Oh waiter? "Camariery"?

1061
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:07,041
I was just telling Wally this afternoon,

1062
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,794
it's such a shame that Steve's wife couldn't come.

1063
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:11,625
You'd just love her. Wouldn't she, Steve?

1064
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:12,780
They'd be crazy about each other.

1065
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:13,839
Really.

1066
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,158
Oh, she's such an amazing girl.

1067
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:17,673
She's had every advantage, and you'd never know it.

1068
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:20,100
No pretenses, no airs.

1069
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:21,393
She sounds wonderful.

1070
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,624
Why didn't you bring her with you?

1071
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:24,354
I wish I had.

1072
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:27,228
Well, you'd never get Gloria to leave those kids.

1073
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:30,026
She devotes herself to them night and day,

1074
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,193
especially the little one.

1075
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:32,938
How old is Josie now?

1076
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:34,033
Seven.

1077
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,608
Walter: Cute as a button, but she's got a bit of a...

1078
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,694
What is it, Steve, a metabolism problem?

1079
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,450
- Metabolism. - Oh, dear.

1080
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,246
So she's a little on the heavy side.

1081
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:43,665
Of course.

1082
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:45,583
Could I have some more wine, please?

1083
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:46,671
Waiter?

1084
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:48,791
But Josie's really a lovely girl,

1085
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,838
and once she gets finished at the orthodontist's,

1086
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:52,462
she's going to be gorgeous.

1087
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,213
She has crooked teeth?

1088
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,760
I think we can find something

1089
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,303
more interesting to talk about

1090
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:59,052
than my daughter's metabolism rate

1091
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,302
or fixing her teeth.

1092
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,635
We could talk about my kids' teeth,

1093
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:05,089
but they never stopped eating long enough to get them fixed.

1094
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:12,018
Did I say something wrong?

1095
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,652
Oh, boy.

1096
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,203
"Oh, boy" -ing again.

1097
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,155
What's bothering Mr. "Sensitive" now?

1098
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:25,787
How would you know about sensitivity,

1099
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,162
picking on an innocent child?

1100
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:29,357
I did not pick on her. I'm sure she's a lovely girl...

1101
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:31,292
A lovely fat girl with crooked teeth.

1102
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:32,860
They're not crooked. They just overlap.

1103
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:34,294
That's crooked.

1104
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:36,126
Oh, boy.

1105
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,672
Let's call a truce, okay?

1106
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:40,881
That's fine by me.

1107
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:44,309
Good. You really are extraordinary.

1108
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:45,516
I've never known a grown man

1109
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:47,000
whose feelings could be hurt so easily.

1110
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:48,889
Do you come from a large family?

1111
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:49,984
Yes.

1112
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,308
Lots of brothers and sisters?

1113
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:53,018
Mm-hmm. ...There you are then.

1114
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:54,398
Your mother spent too much time

1115
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,729
with those other children.

1116
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,610
What is this, a seminar on family relations?

1117
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:59,554
You finish chopping up my daughter, you start in on my mother?

1118
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:01,058
- There you go again. - Well, why not?

1119
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:02,121
It's a strange time

1120
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,891
for someone to start attacking someone's mother.

1121
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,451
I was just talking.

1122
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:06,952
I don't call that just talking,

1123
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:08,229
tearing apart a little old lady

1124
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:09,163
who never did you any harm.

1125
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:10,869
I don't believe this.

1126
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,626
She was a marvelous woman, and I'll tell you this.

1127
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:15,445
We may not have been the richest kids in the neighborhood,

1128
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:17,425
but I never went to school with a dirty shirt.

1129
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,127
Dear God!

1130
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,587
"Polio" shots,

1131
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,422
first electric blanket on the block,

1132
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,428
great food in the winter.

1133
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,760
You lie there and hack away at a woman like that.

1134
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:30,063
Dear God, suddenly I'm in bed with your mother.

1135
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,648
"In bed with my mother"?

1136
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:34,567
That has got to be the most disgusting thing

1137
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,360
I've ever heard in my life.

1138
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:37,448
What are you doing now?

1139
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:39,614
I am leaving the "sanatorium".

1140
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,066
I've had enough therapy.

1141
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:43,117
I'm going back to London tonight.

1142
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:45,161
It'll do us both a world of good.

1143
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,034
You bet your ass.

1144
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,411
What a washout this has been.

1145
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:51,710
I'm going to press it in my book of memories.

1146
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:53,149
You know what you should have been?

1147
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:56,256
A cestode worm, and do you know why?

1148
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,334
A cestode worm has a complete set

1149
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,214
of male and female sexual organs

1150
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,966
in each of its 100 sections

1151
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:05,220
and spends its whole life copulating with itself.

1152
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,846
Wouldn't that be lovely?

1153
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:08,664
You could have taken you away for the weekend.

1154
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:10,474
You would've had you all to yourself!

1155
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:11,805
And all those questions...

1156
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,561
"Was I good?" You were wonderful.

1157
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:15,517
"Did the earth move?" The house fell down.

1158
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:16,612
"Am I manly?"

1159
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,732
No, but you're a great worm.

1160
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:20,155
You missed your profession...

1161
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:24,485
A worm, humping its way through life, and badly.

1162
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,911
Thank you.

1163
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:28,059
Where do you think you're going?

1164
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:29,619
London... it's where I live.

1165
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,040
You can leave tomorrow.

1166
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:33,210
Oh, no. I've had this place with you or without you.

1167
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,899
Though it means sitting on the same plane,

1168
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:36,538
I am going home to my thin children

1169
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,123
with their straight teeth.

1170
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:39,253
Go tomorrow.

1171
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:41,300
I am going now!

1172
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:42,388
All right.

1173
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,009
Okay, but I don't want to hear

1174
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,931
one more word out of you ever.

1175
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,018
Understood?

1176
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:49,809
Perfectly, so listen very clearly,

1177
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,102
because this is the last thing

1178
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:54,352
I will ever say to you: Make a reservation.

1179
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:57,980
Not necessary, and if you're not downstairs in that car

1180
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:00,027
in 10 minutes, I am leaving without you.

1181
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:02,731
You can stay here and find another worm

1182
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:05,033
and hold another seminar.

1183
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,751
Can I help you, sir? Flight 826 to London.

1184
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,006
Two tickets, please.

1185
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:26,008
Flight 826 to London is full.

1186
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,010
Flight 826 to London is never full.

1187
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,136
It is tonight, sir.

1188
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:30,808
When did the last two tickets go?

1189
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:33,603
Just a few moments ago.

1190
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,477
Press that in your book of memories.

1191
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:38,524
When is the next plane to London?

1192
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:41,024
11:30 tomorrow morning.

1193
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,105
11:30 tomorrow morning?

1194
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,405
Can I help you, miss?

1195
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:51,078
Thank you. I'm getting very good at this.

1196
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,208
Good night. Good night.

1197
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:18,557
Welcome to the house of mirth.

1198
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:22,486
One phone call. One stupid phone call.

1199
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:23,799
It would have cost you 7 "pesetas".

1200
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:25,438
You could have won that from your "caddie".

1201
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:26,648
Steve: Oh, yeah?

1202
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,074
Boy, I've had a bellyful

1203
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:29,361
of your chickenshit "innuendos",

1204
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:32,119
your snotty insults, your "smartass" needling.

1205
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:35,040
Oh, get stuffed, you big schmuck.

1206
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:37,287
Listen to "Princess Grace" here.

1207
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:38,585
Bertha ballbuster,

1208
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:39,899
you're as tender, sweet, and feminine

1209
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:40,923
as "Attila the Hun".

1210
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,668
You should know.

1211
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,249
You should have a uniform and whistle.

1212
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:46,300
You direct traffic in bed, out of bed,

1213
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:48,299
on the phone, in the car.

1214
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:50,255
Talk about penis envy. You invented it.

1215
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:51,886
Oh!

1216
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:54,054
Now.

1217
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,510
Now.

1218
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:58,688
Man: Don't... don't break the lamps!

1219
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:00,807
Bozo!

1220
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:03,810
Excuse me.

1221
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:05,732
Mind your back!

1222
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:08,740
All right...

1223
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:11,819
You typical... typical American!

1224
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:15,868
Is this a way to treat a hotel?

1225
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:17,950
Okay. Okay.

1226
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:21,081
Don't do it!

1227
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:22,207
Ow!

1228
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:23,505
I'm sorry.

1229
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:25,169
Easy!

1230
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:27,755
Bloody American... typical!

1231
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,882
Thank you very much. Good night.

1232
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:37,101
Now, Mr. "Know-all".

1233
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,685
Ooh!

1234
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:50,815
Oh!

1235
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,571
Damn you!

1236
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:28,604
For God's sake,

1237
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:29,738
my one chance to be raped,

1238
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:31,489
you can't get your bloody trousers off.

1239
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:48,354
Isn't that Vickie and Steve?

1240
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:54,197
Oh. I guess they're getting together.

1241
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:56,070
I hope we haven't started something.

1242
01:05:56,161 --> 01:05:58,072
With Steve? Not a chance.

1243
01:05:58,163 --> 01:05:59,744
He's probably selling her a policy.

1244
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:13,962
She just grabbed his arm.

1245
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,573
What should she grab? She just met him.

1246
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:16,928
Keep your eye on the bull.

1247
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:20,173
Crowd: "Ole"!

1248
01:06:20,268 --> 01:06:21,724
Be!

1249
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:24,348
Be!

1250
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:36,068
Be!

1251
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:38,467
You can't tell me they weren't holding hands.

1252
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:40,637
Oh, you're fantastic.

1253
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:42,588
Two people reach for a peanut at the same time,

1254
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:44,036
and right away they're holding hands.

1255
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,721
You got a mind like a house detective.

1256
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:47,302
You should know.

1257
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,058
Just pass me the potato chips...

1258
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,354
After you've checked them out

1259
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:51,681
for fingerprints.

1260
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:54,108
Oh, boy.

1261
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:59,322

that's awful. ...I thought it was beautiful.

1273
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:31,520
Were you in love when you wrote it?

1274
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:34,065
Of course. I was 18, in college, and in love. Weren't you?

1275
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:35,152
No.

1276
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:36,351
At 187?

1277
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:37,446
No.

1278
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:39,091
When was the first time you fell in love?

1279
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,776
I didn't. “What"?

1280
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:43,779
Well, that blind passionate selfless all-out whatever

1281
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,360
I have never felt.

1282
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:47,116
Maybe I'm not capable of feeling it.

1283
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:48,787
I don't believe that.

1284
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:52,493
Why not? I'm your everyday cold-assed supercilious

1285
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:53,997
englishwoman, remember?

1286
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:55,874
I'm terribly sorry I said that.

1287
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,331
Don't be. It warmed things up quite a bit.

1288
01:08:58,426 --> 01:08:59,757
- It did? - Mim-hm.

1289
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:01,550
I'm very pleased to hear that.

1290
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:02,844
Mr. Blackburn.

1291
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:05,474
What is it?

1292
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:07,469
Your tickets to London. They're confirmed.

1293
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:09,846
Oh, no, no.

1294
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:11,302
We don't leave till the 26th.

1295
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:12,933
This is the 26th.

1296
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:15,223
You leave at 5:00.

1297
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:20,562
Thank you.

1298
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:35,205
Shall we take a swim?

1299
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:37,003
Yes, please.

1300
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:47,718
Hey!

1301
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:50,141
Hey! Look alive down there.

1302
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:51,809
Ready when you are.

1303
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:54,057
Lights and camera.

1304
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:55,513
Alright.

1305
01:09:57,235 --> 01:09:58,235
Action.

1306
01:09:58,319 --> 01:09:59,354
Walter: Steve!

1307
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:00,480
Hey, Steve!

1308
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:02,319
Aah!

1309
01:10:07,078 --> 01:10:09,038
What's so important you have to crash in like this

1310
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:10,237
without calling?

1311
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:12,868
I have to make an appointment? This is business.

1312
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:14,620
There is nothing about your business...

1313
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:16,622
It's not my business. That's too intelligent,

1314
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:18,249
keeping my nose in my own business.

1315
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:21,206
This is none of my business: You and the lady.

1316
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,611
I don't know what you're talking...

1317
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:24,466
At the bullfight, the beach, the bars,

1318
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:26,510
the restaurant, the airport.

1319
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:28,212
What are we doing? Where are you going?

1320
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:30,218
I have something I'm going to say,

1321
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:32,220
how do you want it? In front of her here

1322
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,723
or up there by ourselves?

1323
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:51,407
Listen carefully, 'cause I know what I'm talking about.

1324
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:53,863
I'm one of the walking wounded.

1325
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:55,573
It's true.

1326
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,375
Even a schlub like me gets action once in a while.

1327
01:10:58,463 --> 01:11:01,330
Most of it's tired quail that flies south the next day,

1328
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:03,130
but once and only once

1329
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:05,674
did I hook into the real thing.

1330
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:07,047
It happened in Malibu.

1331
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:09,800
Oh, boy, was she something.

1332
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:12,678
We had a great setup. We had a shack on the beach.

1333
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:15,932
She cooked. I ate. We dug each other.

1334
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:17,683
You know what a thrill this is...

1335
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:19,230
To while away my last hours here

1336
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:21,273
listening to the plot of your next movie?

1337
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:25,444
This was for real, Steve, and it was fantastic,

1338
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:28,527
but then the guilt started tearing me apart.

1339
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:29,824
Bill.

1340
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:33,244
Wait. I went to a shrink five times a week

1341
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:35,697
to hear the same questions... "Do you love the girl?"

1342
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:36,792
"I love the girl."

1343
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:39,663
"Do you love your wife and kids?" "Of course."

1344
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:41,540
"Would you give them up for her?"

1345
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:42,666
"No."

1346
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:44,122
"Would you give the girl up?"

1347
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:46,299
"I can't. I love her."

1348
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:48,296
$18,000 later,

1349
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:49,797
he came to the key question:

1350
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:53,051
"Do you love her enough to give her up?"

1351
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,554
That's the one that pinned me to the rack.

1352
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:58,853
One cockamamie question cost me $18,000,

1353
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:00,521
and that doesn't include the kleenex

1354
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:01,973
I used up crying.

1355
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:04,939
I didn't go back to the coast for five years.

1356
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:07,270
By that time she had twin boys

1357
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:08,855
and a kidney-shaped pool,

1358
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:11,407
went to weight watchers every Thursday night.

1359
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,951
I've got to go meet Patty and the boys.

1360
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,745
We're going on some picnic.

1361
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:19,119
That's all I need now is Spanish ants.

1362
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:22,869
You two may be just two ships

1363
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:25,580
that passed in the night, scraped hulls for a week,

1364
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:27,836
in which case relax and enjoy.

1365
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:31,555
I see.

1366
01:12:32,098 --> 01:12:34,089
Lots of luck.

1367
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:44,850
He was right, your fat friend.

1368
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:47,853
He was right.

1369
01:12:48,406 --> 01:12:49,842
He loved the girl enough to give her up,

1370
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:51,777
but my god, $18,000?

1371
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:54,109
I could have told him for a lot less.

1372
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:56,493
I'm not giving you up.

1373
01:12:56,581 --> 01:12:57,581
What?

1374
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:58,780
I'm not giving you up.

1375
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,912
Look, I know I'm selfish and I'm neurotic.

1376
01:13:02,003 --> 01:13:03,584
And American. American.

1377
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:04,671
- Married. - Married.

1378
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:05,790
Spoiled. And spoiled.

1379
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:08,464
Which is precisely why I'm not giving you up.

1380
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:10,542
Why can't we get a little flat in soho?

1381
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,547
We'll see each other whenever we can.

1382
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:14,594
If you're worried about breaking up a family,

1383
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:15,797
forget it.

1384
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:17,369
There's going to be no families broken up.

1385
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,179
Take my word.

1386
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:21,852
I think that soho makes a lot of sense.

1387
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:23,475
You can walk there.

1388
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:26,182
I can take a taxi, the tube, or the 22 bus.

1389
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:29,269
Vickie, what the hell have we got to lose?

1390
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:34,656
Which part of soho did you have in mind?

1391
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:36,947
Oh.

1392
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:38,403
Do you like Chinese food?

1393
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:39,532
Oh, I love Chinese food.

1394
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:42,491
There is a street called macclesfield street.

1395
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:44,701
- Do you know it? - Oh, yes.

1396
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:46,148
Vickie: You've had a flat there before.

1397
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:47,378
Steve: Oh, many times.

1398
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:26,875
Ah, what's the flat number?

1399
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:28,373
Um, 4d.

1400
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:33,590
They're all named French. You think they're related?

1401
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:36,252
Only in price. Only in what?

1402
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:39,180
Price.

1403
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:47,514
What do you think?

1404
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:50,270
It's... it's not bad.

1405
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:51,771
It isn't, is it, really?

1406
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:53,523
I mean, it's got distinct possibilities.

1407
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:54,614
Sure.

1408
01:14:54,699 --> 01:14:57,065
- Oh, god. - Be careful.

1409
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:58,319
Oh, wow.

1410
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:03,381
Hello. You moving into 4d?

1411
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:04,511
Yes. Yes, I am.

1412
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:08,345
Oh, I'm dora French. I'm in 5d, just above.

1413
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:09,439
Hello.

1414
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:13,983
Oh, uh, if it'll get a bit busy,

1415
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:16,686
anything you can't handle, know what I mean?

1416
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:18,649
I'd be most obliged.

1417
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:21,483
Of course. It would be my pleasure, certainly. Yes.

1418
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:23,484
Thanks. Not at all.

1419
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,285
- Bye. - Bye.

1420
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,626
This is the second day she's forgotten her lunch box.

1421
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:38,082
Would you like some coffee?

1422
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:41,920
No. I ate too much. "Coq au vin" was perfect.

1423
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:43,879
Thank you.

1424
01:16:43,974 --> 01:16:45,930
I think I'm going to walk it off.

1425
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:47,883
Take Dilly with you. Dilly?

1426
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:49,013
Yeah. Take him with you.

1427
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:51,266
You think he should go out in the rain?

1428
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:53,348
It stopped an hour ago.

1429
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:58,357
Oh, yeah, right. Dilly, come on.

1430
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:15,880
Taxi!

1431
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:38,275
Hello. ...Hi.

1432
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:39,442
Hi

1433
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:43,199
Oh.

1434
01:17:43,284 --> 01:17:44,319
Sorry about this.

1435
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:46,071
That's alright.

1436
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:47,402
Are we eating?

1437
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:48,906
That is what we arranged.

1438
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:51,410
Oh, right, right, right.

1439
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,660
What are we having?

1440
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:55,208
"Coq au vin". Well, I hope you're hungry.

1441
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:57,287
I can always eat. Good.

1442
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:00,547
I'll just put Dilly down.

1443
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:03,467
Take your coat off.

1444
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:05,340
How did you manage to get away?

1445
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:07,592
Well, actually, I'm... I'm out walking the dog.

1446
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:12,767
Goodbye, "coq au vin".

1447
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,901
Wait... your sweater!

1448
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:23,104
Oh, god, oh, god.

1449
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:26,111
Okay? Give me that, give me that.

1450
01:18:26,202 --> 01:18:27,442
Come on.

1451
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:33,205
Come on. Oh, Crikey, you've got four arms.

1452
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:34,623
Thursday, Thursday.

1453
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,621
Thursday. Go on.

1454
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:50,551
Is that you, dear?

1455
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:53,137
Yeah. How did it go?

1456
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:55,470
Was he a good boy or a bad boy?

1457
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,442
I'm gonna take him out for another 20 minutes.

1458
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:03,769
- That's silly. - No it isn't, dear.

1459
01:19:03,864 --> 01:19:05,775
If you train a dog, you gotta train him right.

1460
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:10,701
Dilly. Come on, Dilly. Come on, boy. Come on, Dilly.

1461
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:16,619
Taxi!

1462
01:19:56,959 --> 01:19:58,199
I've had a job offered me.

1463
01:19:58,294 --> 01:19:59,875
I wasn't going to tell you.

1464
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:01,452
I wasn't going to take it,

1465
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:04,163
but I know now it's the only way out.

1466
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:05,293
Where?

1467
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:07,875
A long way away... Johannesburg.

1468
01:20:09,138 --> 01:20:10,548
Oh, Eric.

1469
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,300
My brother's out there.

1470
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:14,382
They're opening a hospital, they want me.

1471
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,885
It's a fine opportunity, really.

1472
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:20,221
I'll take Madeline and the boys.

1473
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:21,396
It's been torturing me...

1474
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,064
The necessity of making a decision

1475
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:24,312
one way or the other.

1476
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:26,940
I haven't told anybody... Not even Madeline.

1477
01:20:28,073 --> 01:20:31,065
Do you want me to stay? To turn down the offer?

1478
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,275
Don't be foolish, Eric.

1479
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:33,984
Eric: Forgive me?

1480
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:36,408
Woman: Forgive you for what?

1481
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:38,159
For bringing you so much misery.

1482
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:40,832
Woman: I'll forgive you if you'll forgive me.

1483
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:43,581
How will it end with us?

1484
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:45,708
Oh, don't talk about it. I don't know.

1485
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:48,085
It'll end. Everything ends.

1486
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:54,842
Woman: All that was a week ago...

1487
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:56,139
Socks, please.

1488
01:20:56,226 --> 01:20:58,308
Woman: Incredible it should be so short a time.

1489
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:02,145
Today was our last day together...

1490
01:21:02,232 --> 01:21:04,223
Our very last together...

1491
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:07,188
Dirty enough?

1492
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:10,028
It's beautiful.

1493
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:14,783
Those last few hours went by so quickly.

1494
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:17,073
Sunday?

1495
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:19,617
Oh, yeah, Sunday.

1496
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:26,252
Sunday.

1497
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:27,671
As we walked through the station,

1498
01:21:27,758 --> 01:21:29,714
I had no thoughts at all,

1499
01:21:30,928 --> 01:21:32,543
only an overwhelming desire

1500
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:34,720
not to feel anything ever again.

1501
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:44,145
Man: What do you say?

1502
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:58,573
Safe. The game's over.

1503
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:11,373
Excuse me.

1504
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:13,424
Sorry.

1505
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:30,150
Here you are. You're not leaving?

1506
01:22:30,237 --> 01:22:32,353
I have to. We're taking the kids to lunch.

1507
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:33,733
Didn't I tell you? No.

1508
01:22:33,824 --> 01:22:35,860
I thought I mentioned it. I'm sorry.

1509
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:37,441
That's alright.

1510
01:22:37,536 --> 01:22:38,696
You didn't go to any trouble?

1511
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:40,072
No. It's alright. You sure?

1512
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:42,655
Truly. Do you have time for coffee?

1513
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:44,956
I don't even have time to take a shower.

1514
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:47,705
Are you going to take your kids to lunch?

1515
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,377
Something like that? Yes.

1516
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:50,733
Really, it's alright. Don't worry.

1517
01:22:50,757 --> 01:22:52,543
You're sure? You look worried.

1518
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:54,420
I'm only worried you'll be late.

1519
01:22:55,512 --> 01:22:57,127
Have a nice day. And you.

1520
01:23:25,584 --> 01:23:27,916
Cecil, it's me.

1521
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:30,335
Listen, how would you like to come over for lunch,

1522
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:31,878
stay for dinner, play some chess,

1523
01:23:31,965 --> 01:23:33,705
watch television, and kiss me goodnight?

1524
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:36,500
I'm sorry. I've already made arrangements for all that.

1525
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:37,880
Vickie: Of course you have.

1526
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:38,971
Bye.

1527
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:40,056
Bye.

1528
01:24:26,645 --> 01:24:28,101
The picture is about set.

1529
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:29,598
I hired this hot new director.

1530
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:31,476
Sensational. 12 g's.

1531
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:33,603
He's 24yo, he's got hair to here.

1532
01:24:33,694 --> 01:24:36,106
He has to use a shoehorn to get into his pants.

1533
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:37,652
The guy wears bracelets.

1534
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:39,570
He has heels like that. “Walter...

1535
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:41,614
The guy's last picture was a smash.

1536
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:43,033
Kind of a group grope in 3-d.

1537
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,826
Walter... When you see those big boobs

1538
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:46,904
coming out of the screen at you, you better duck.

1539
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:48,455
Walter...

1540
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:51,040
Walter. “What?

1541
01:24:51,128 --> 01:24:53,995
You remember that talk we had in Spain?

1542
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:55,489
Don't tell me that's still going on.

1543
01:24:58,051 --> 01:24:59,587
You told me that you broke up

1544
01:24:59,678 --> 01:25:01,589
because you loved her,

1545
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,136
but you didn't tell me how.

1546
01:25:05,225 --> 01:25:06,761
Only one way, pal.

1547
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:08,217
According to the rules

1548
01:25:08,312 --> 01:25:10,098
laid down by the Geneva convention,

1549
01:25:10,188 --> 01:25:12,520
kick her in the teeth... Lay it on the line.

1550
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:15,145
Sometimes you got to be cruel to be kind.

1551
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:19,356
I got it. Lunch is on me.

1552
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:21,689
I hate to see a guy losing them all.

1553
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:26,489
Hey, could you lend me a couple of pounds?

1554
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:28,491
Why don't you sign, Walter?

1555
01:25:28,582 --> 01:25:30,618
They won't let me do that in here anymore.

1556
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:32,199
My treat.

1557
01:25:48,685 --> 01:25:51,267
Assorted colors, you know, from up there.

1558
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:52,686
Okay. ...Thank you.

1559
01:25:54,941 --> 01:25:55,941
Hello?

1560
01:25:56,026 --> 01:25:58,267
Hi. Can you make it tonight?

1561
01:25:58,362 --> 01:26:01,104
I thought this was your night for the symphony.

1562
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:04,690
I can get away for a bit. I want to talk to you.

1563
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:07,777
Can you get a sitter and meet me at the flat?

1564
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:09,361
Oh, well, okay. Fine.

1565
01:26:09,456 --> 01:26:11,617
Good. See you later.

1566
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:13,244
Bye.

1567
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:11,799
I'm in a hurry. Alright.

1568
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:22,729
Well, I must say it is flattering

1569
01:27:22,821 --> 01:27:24,402
that you'd give up Beethoven for me,

1570
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:26,354
even if it's only for 30 bars. Drink?

1571
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:27,940
No, thanks.

1572
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:30,363
Vickie... yes.

1573
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:35,743
Why don't you sit down?

1574
01:27:35,834 --> 01:27:37,324
Thank you.

1575
01:27:40,589 --> 01:27:42,830
Vickie... yes again.

1576
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:47,751
I think I'll have that drink.

1577
01:27:52,726 --> 01:27:55,388
You said you had something you wanted to say to me.

1578
01:27:55,479 --> 01:27:57,185
I do, I do.

1579
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:59,763
I...I have something that I...l want to say to you.

1580
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:00,973
Uh...

1581
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:06,479
Um, well,

1582
01:28:06,573 --> 01:28:09,861
I've been doing some thinking about us,

1583
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:11,782
which is natural...

1584
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:13,360
Yes, yes, yes.

1585
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:14,991
And, uh...

1586
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:19,578
It's...

1587
01:28:20,879 --> 01:28:25,748
Well, what I wanted to say was that, uh...

1588
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:29,293
It's just that, uh...

1589
01:28:30,931 --> 01:28:32,262
That, uh...

1590
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:36,842
I love you very much,

1591
01:28:36,937 --> 01:28:40,020
and I can't seem to get you out of my mind,

1592
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:43,436
which is not that important, but, uh...

1593
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:45,893
Oh, my God.

1594
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:50,738
Oh, you are so ignorant about what is important.

1595
01:29:15,725 --> 01:29:17,056
What are you doing?

1596
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:18,508
Hey. Taking your coat off.

1597
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:21,015
Oh, no, no, no, we can't... no, we can't.

1598
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:22,687
No, no, no, this is ridiculous.

1599
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:24,730
We can't do this. I've got to be at Albert hall.

1600
01:29:24,818 --> 01:29:26,729
You don't have to be at Albert hall at all.

1601
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:28,026
They're playing "Beethoven".

1602
01:29:28,113 --> 01:29:30,104
Vickie: Beethoven won't mind.

1603
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:51,875
You've been gone a long time.

1604
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:53,961
- Are you alright? - Fine, fine.

1605
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:01,555
Did you leave the house that way?

1606
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:03,936
What way?

1607
01:30:04,024 --> 01:30:06,015
With a golf sock.

1608
01:30:09,362 --> 01:30:11,273
Well, I must have.

1609
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:13,446
How could that happen?

1610
01:30:13,533 --> 01:30:15,239
How many times have I told you

1611
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:17,033
keep the kids out of my drawers?

1612
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,610
Okay, Steve.

1613
01:30:18,705 --> 01:30:21,071
And from now on, don't rush me when I'm dressing.

1614
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:22,497
Alright.

1615
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:45,683
The actuarial reports, their sales receipts.

1616
01:30:48,026 --> 01:30:50,938
Well, that's it, Derek. I'm off to lunch.

1617
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:53,111
It's... it's been a long time between lunches, huh?

1618
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:55,940
Nice of you to keep score, Derek, but not essential.

1619
01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:57,945
What shall I say if someone calls?

1620
01:30:58,036 --> 01:31:00,072
I told you... I'm out to lunch.

1621
01:31:00,163 --> 01:31:02,825
One of the long ones or the short ones?

1622
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:05,407
What if I told you it was none of your business?

1623
01:31:05,502 --> 01:31:07,288
I'd say it was along one.

1624
01:31:07,754 --> 01:31:09,961
You like your job here, Derek? Just keep talking.

1625
01:31:10,048 --> 01:31:11,959
It'll be one of the short ones.

1626
01:31:15,178 --> 01:31:18,841
Hello. Oh, just a moment.

1627
01:31:18,932 --> 01:31:20,468
It's for you.

1628
01:31:20,558 --> 01:31:22,173
I told you... I'm not here.

1629
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:24,472
Oh, I think you are, sir.

1630
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:28,983
Hello?

1631
01:31:29,067 --> 01:31:31,399
Vickie: I'm not going to be able to make lunch.

1632
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:32,726
What happened?

1633
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:34,106
What didn't happen?

1634
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:38,486
I mean, the dyes are all wrong, none of the colors... go away!

1635
01:31:38,576 --> 01:31:40,191
They've screwed up all the orders,

1636
01:31:40,286 --> 01:31:41,651
the sizings are all wrong.

1637
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:44,408
I have to get to the warehouse and sort it out.

1638
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:45,989
Can't you put it off 'till tomorrow?

1639
01:31:46,084 --> 01:31:49,872
I can't. They have to be on the plane for New York today.

1640
01:31:49,963 --> 01:31:52,705
Listen, can you make dinner?

1641
01:31:52,799 --> 01:31:54,039
I don't think I can.

1642
01:31:54,134 --> 01:31:57,001
Vickie: Well, I can get a sitter.

1643
01:31:57,095 --> 01:31:58,801
I think we got something planned.

1644
01:31:58,888 --> 01:32:01,675
Dinner could go on all the way through till breakfast.

1645
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:05,304
Breakfast, huh? Let me see what I can do.

1646
01:32:05,395 --> 01:32:08,307
God bless you, Mr. Blackburn.

1647
01:32:08,398 --> 01:32:10,684
Now, what was all that...

1648
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:19,481
Would you get me one of those Italian sandwiches, Derek?

1649
01:32:19,576 --> 01:32:21,612
A long one or a short one?

1650
01:32:21,703 --> 01:32:23,409
Just get the sandwich, Derek.

1651
01:32:40,764 --> 01:32:41,799
Hello?

1652
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:42,890
Hi. Didi catch you?

1653
01:32:42,974 --> 01:32:44,635
I'm going out the door.

1654
01:32:44,726 --> 01:32:45,932
Don't hurry. What?

1655
01:32:46,019 --> 01:32:49,056
I have to get a prospectus out to New York

1656
01:32:49,147 --> 01:32:50,182
and Oslo immediately.

1657
01:32:51,524 --> 01:32:52,889
Oh, my God.

1658
01:32:52,984 --> 01:32:56,351
If I work straight through, I can be there by 11:00.

1659
01:32:56,446 --> 01:32:59,529
Why don't we forget tonight? If you've got to work, work.

1660
01:32:59,616 --> 01:33:00,822
Don't blow a fuse.

1661
01:33:02,035 --> 01:33:04,651
Can you... hold on a second.

1662
01:33:04,746 --> 01:33:07,658
Hello. Could you wait just one second, please?

1663
01:33:07,749 --> 01:33:09,489
Vickie, don't be ridiculous.

1664
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:12,417
I will be there by 11:00 no matter what happens.

1665
01:33:12,504 --> 01:33:14,711
If work isn't done, I'll finish it later.

1666
01:33:14,798 --> 01:33:16,629
Is that okay? Perfectly.

1667
01:33:16,716 --> 01:33:18,297
You're sure? Absolutely.

1668
01:33:18,384 --> 01:33:19,999
I'm sorry I sounded like such a twit.

1669
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:22,427
Forget it. I'll see you at 11:00.

1670
01:33:22,514 --> 01:33:23,970
- Hello... - Hello?

1671
01:33:24,057 --> 01:33:25,797
- Gloria: Hello, Steve? - Hello, Gloria.

1672
01:33:25,892 --> 01:33:26,927
Where are you?

1673
01:33:27,018 --> 01:33:29,634
What do you mean? I'm here at the office.

1674
01:33:29,729 --> 01:33:33,267
You're supposed to be home. The curtain goes up at 7:30.

1675
01:33:33,358 --> 01:33:34,473
What curtain?

1676
01:33:34,567 --> 01:33:36,728
Preview of the new pinter play, unicef benefit.

1677
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:38,481
I'm on the committee.

1678
01:33:38,571 --> 01:33:43,440
I forgot. I got to get a report out tomorrow.

1679
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:44,991
It's going to take me hours.

1680
01:33:45,078 --> 01:33:47,034
Then finish it after the play.

1681
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:48,282
Come home now.

1682
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:50,455
I am not walking into that theater alone.

1683
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:53,375
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1684
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:55,042
What time does the play finish?

1685
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:57,121
- 10:30. - Alright,

1686
01:33:57,215 --> 01:33:59,171
but I'm gonna have to work later, Gloria,

1687
01:33:59,259 --> 01:34:00,339
much later.

1688
01:34:00,426 --> 01:34:02,041
Alright, but come home now.

1689
01:34:02,137 --> 01:34:03,422
All right.

1690
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:16,147
Oh, Christ.

1691
01:34:37,463 --> 01:34:39,169
Oh, no.

1692
01:34:39,257 --> 01:34:41,043
Oh, don't tell me.

1693
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:43,917
Oh, damn.

1694
01:34:45,471 --> 01:34:47,177
Oh, well.

1695
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:05,188
Oh, hello.

1696
01:35:05,283 --> 01:35:06,693
Hello. We met on the stairs.

1697
01:35:06,784 --> 01:35:07,784
Yes, how are you?

1698
01:35:07,869 --> 01:35:10,201
Very well. Thank you. I'm sorry to bother you.

1699
01:35:10,288 --> 01:35:11,824
But do you have oregano?

1700
01:35:11,915 --> 01:35:15,533
Christ, I hope not. I had a checkup last week.

1701
01:35:15,627 --> 01:35:19,211
No, actually, it's a herb,

1702
01:35:19,297 --> 01:35:21,538
and, um, I was doing some cooking,

1703
01:35:21,633 --> 01:35:23,214
and I ran out.

1704
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:25,041
Oh, no.

1705
01:35:25,136 --> 01:35:27,092
I don't have much use for my kitchen,

1706
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:28,841
know what I mean? Of course not.

1707
01:35:28,932 --> 01:35:30,797
But there's a delicatessen on Dean street

1708
01:35:30,892 --> 01:35:32,223
just across shaftesbury Avenue.

1709
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:35,097
Of course there is. I'll try there. Thank you.

1710
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:42,941
Hello. Good evening.

1711
01:35:43,029 --> 01:35:45,270
A jar of oregano, please.

1712
01:35:45,365 --> 01:35:47,230
14p.

1713
01:35:47,325 --> 01:35:49,816
14p. Cheers. Thanks very much.

1714
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:31,618
Hello.

1715
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:32,988
- Hello. - Hello.

1716
01:36:34,372 --> 01:36:35,657
Finish your work?

1717
01:36:35,748 --> 01:36:37,784
No. I got to get back.

1718
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:40,036
Must be a very important account.

1719
01:36:40,128 --> 01:36:42,585
Tremendous. Tremendous.

1720
01:36:42,672 --> 01:36:46,210
45 ships, $70 million in insurance.

1721
01:36:46,301 --> 01:36:47,381
Ooh, what's that?

1722
01:36:47,468 --> 01:36:49,880
Um, it's "chicken hunter".

1723
01:36:49,971 --> 01:36:51,461
Mmm. What's that smell?

1724
01:36:51,556 --> 01:36:53,387
Oregano. Oregano.

1725
01:36:54,392 --> 01:36:58,852
And, uh, I ran out of it earlier this evening.

1726
01:36:58,938 --> 01:37:01,304
I did, and I had to go to the delicatessen

1727
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:02,935
to get some more.

1728
01:37:03,026 --> 01:37:04,311
Mm-hmm. At this hour?

1729
01:37:04,402 --> 01:37:06,313
At this hour, and a funny thing happened

1730
01:37:06,404 --> 01:37:08,520
on the way back from the delicatessen.

1731
01:37:08,614 --> 01:37:10,525
I bumped into shaftesbury Avenue

1732
01:37:10,616 --> 01:37:12,652
just as the theaters were letting out,

1733
01:37:12,744 --> 01:37:14,780
and how was the play?

1734
01:37:17,123 --> 01:37:19,079
I tried to call... Of course you did.

1735
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:20,327
I did, Vickie.

1736
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:24,127
Gloria rang after you hung up, and she's on this committee...

1737
01:37:24,213 --> 01:37:25,328
Oh, a committee.

1738
01:37:25,423 --> 01:37:29,712
I called you right back, but your line was busy.

1739
01:37:29,802 --> 01:37:32,794
Look, take your wife to the theater.

1740
01:37:32,889 --> 01:37:34,379
Don't give me any of this bullshit

1741
01:37:34,474 --> 01:37:36,886
about $75 million and 85 billion ships.

1742
01:37:36,976 --> 01:37:40,264
It's no bullshit, only it was 45 ships and $70 million.

1743
01:37:40,355 --> 01:37:42,311
I'm fed up with you.

1744
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:44,059
I'm fed up with this arrangement.

1745
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:45,961
I'm fed up with hanging around on the off chance

1746
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:47,646
that you may condescend to drop in

1747
01:37:47,737 --> 01:37:49,068
between the baseball and the golf.

1748
01:37:49,155 --> 01:37:52,363
And if you don't have to take your children to kew gardens.

1749
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:54,315
If you want a whore, step outside...

1750
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:57,277
Press any of those buttons marked French.

1751
01:37:57,372 --> 01:38:00,580
You are a thoughtless, callous, selfish...

1752
01:38:00,666 --> 01:38:04,534
Do not... just do not touch me.

1753
01:38:04,629 --> 01:38:05,914
Do not.

1754
01:38:09,217 --> 01:38:10,627
Oh, Christ.

1755
01:38:30,947 --> 01:38:33,063
I'm beginning to sound like a wife.

1756
01:39:45,563 --> 01:39:48,930
Inland telegraph? This is account 12087.

1757
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:54,485
Goes to Vickie Allessio... A-double I-e-double s-i-o...

1758
01:39:54,572 --> 01:39:58,064
8 Macclesfield street, flat 4.

1759
01:39:58,868 --> 01:40:00,074
Message.

1760
01:40:02,121 --> 01:40:05,079
Darling, our fat friend was right...

1761
01:40:06,584 --> 01:40:09,417
Only it didn't cost $18,000.

1762
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:12,502
It cost a lot more.

1763
01:40:14,717 --> 01:40:16,253
Signed Steve.

1764
01:40:17,303 --> 01:40:19,168
Could you read that back, please?

1765
01:40:24,435 --> 01:40:27,051
That's it. Thank you.

1766
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:31,605
Wow.

1767
01:41:17,655 --> 01:41:19,065
Inland telegraph?

1768
01:41:19,156 --> 01:41:21,067
This is 12087.

1769
01:41:21,158 --> 01:41:23,114
I sent a telegram about 20 minutes ago.

1770
01:41:23,202 --> 01:41:25,488
I'd like to stop it. Can you do that?

1771
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:27,491
12087.

1772
01:41:28,874 --> 01:41:30,364
You can?

1773
01:41:30,459 --> 01:41:32,666
Cancel it immediately. Thank you.

1774
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:55,021
"Steve..."

1775
01:41:56,861 --> 01:41:59,568
"Steve, you made me feel 18

1776
01:41:59,655 --> 01:42:02,522
for the first time in my life..."

1777
01:42:02,617 --> 01:42:04,482
Oh, shit.

1778
01:42:06,912 --> 01:42:09,654
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

1779
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:54,411
Vickie.

1780
01:42:54,502 --> 01:42:56,663
Vickie, I got some lasagna at the terrazza.

1781
01:42:56,754 --> 01:42:58,710
Come and get it.

1782
01:43:00,383 --> 01:43:01,748
Vickie?

1783
01:43:19,110 --> 01:43:20,110
Vickie!

1784
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:21,684
