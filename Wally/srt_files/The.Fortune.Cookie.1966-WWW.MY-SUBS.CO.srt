- What?
- Your left leg is numb,

182
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,169
and you got no feeling
in the first three fingers of your right hand.

183
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,966
You're crazy.
I can move my hand and my leg.

We settle for a quarter of a million.

who makes his own diagnosis.

your hand and your leg,

they don't know what to do with it.

They've run out of storage space.
They have to microfilm it.

Oh, it's lucky I didn't,

342
00:21:35,687 --> 00:21:38,690
because I would have strangled you
with one of Gus Gilroy's fancy ties!

343
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:41,568
That's how nice and kind I am!
And what would you...

344
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:43,653
Sandy, don't pay any attention to him.
He's had a concussion.

345
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:45,488
He doesn't know what he's saying.

346
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:47,574
Well, it may be a couple of days
before we have the doctor's reports.

347
00:21:47,615 --> 00:21:48,658
Where can I reach you?

348
00:21:50,118 --> 00:21:52,245
Don't worry... Don't worry, baby.

349
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:54,039
If your friend answers, I'll hang up.

350
00:21:54,873 --> 00:21:58,418
Okay. If it's more convenient,
you call here. Right. Goodbye, Sandy.

351
00:21:58,501 --> 00:21:59,878
Of all the miserable broads.

352
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,088
I don't know
what I ever saw in her in the first place.

353
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:05,008
Cooks like a pig and smokes in bed!

354
00:22:06,676 --> 00:22:09,763
Used to walk around like a zombie
because her nail polish was always wet.

355
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,890
That's unless she was crawling
on her knees

356
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,433
trying to find one of her contact lenses.

357
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:15,769
Best thing ever happened to me
was when she cut out!

358
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,771
Still crazy about her, huh?

359
00:22:17,854 --> 00:22:19,647
And stupid!

360
00:22:19,731 --> 00:22:20,940
(GRUNTS)

361
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:25,278
Never read a book in her life.

362
00:22:26,363 --> 00:22:29,282
She read one book... <i>The Carpetbaggers.</i>

363
00:22:29,324 --> 00:22:31,701
End of six months she was on page 19.

364
00:22:33,703 --> 00:22:37,749
We had no life together,
no dialogue, no laughs, no...

365
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:41,795
You know, Harry, I've seen guys
carry a torch before, but you're the champ.

366
00:22:41,836 --> 00:22:43,630
You could carry it
from Greece to Mexico City

367
00:22:43,671 --> 00:22:45,298
to open the next Olympic Games.

368
00:22:45,382 --> 00:22:46,716
- Me?
- You.

369
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,801
(CHUCKLES)

370
00:22:47,842 --> 00:22:50,929
You out of your skull? You know
how many girls I've had since Sandy?

371
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,641
There was Phyllis.
There was Sheila. There was Janet...

372
00:22:54,724 --> 00:22:56,559
Use the other hand. That one's numb.

373
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:58,061
Don't give me with that torch.

374
00:22:58,144 --> 00:22:59,729
As far as I'm concerned, it's...

375
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:03,316
The funny thing is, she still cares about you.

376
00:23:04,776 --> 00:23:06,653
The hell she does.

377
00:23:06,694 --> 00:23:07,904
Did you hear her?

378
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:10,573
Did you hear her on the phone?
She was practically crying.

379
00:23:10,657 --> 00:23:12,992
The next time she calls
and she hears what shape you're in,

380
00:23:13,034 --> 00:23:16,913
mangled and helpless, she's gonna
hop the first plane from New York.

381
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:20,583
You play along with me, Harry,
and you'll get your wife back.

382
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,211
Who wants her?

383
00:23:23,294 --> 00:23:27,048
You do. Because you still love her.

384
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:31,052
(DOOR OPENS)

385
00:23:31,136 --> 00:23:33,054
So we open the kid up
and what do you think we find?

386
00:23:33,138 --> 00:23:36,307
Three buttons, a thumbtack,
and 27 cents in change.

387
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:37,725
- Morning, Doctor.
- Morning.

388
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:40,728
Parents couldn't afford to pay
for the operation so I kept the 27 cents.

389
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,150
I'm Dr. Krugman.
How are you feeling today?

390
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:47,193
Oh, pretty good.

391
00:23:47,277 --> 00:23:51,072
He means, considering.
What do the X-rays show?

392
00:23:51,156 --> 00:23:54,451
Kind of curious myself.
I was sitting on the 40-yard line.

393
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:56,536
<i>Oy, gevalt!</i>

394
00:24:01,499 --> 00:24:04,294
- Mmm.
- You said it, Doctor.

395
00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:11,384
Sister, would you mind
cranking the bed down?

396
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:13,553
Yes, indeed.

397
00:24:19,684 --> 00:24:22,520
Oh! Oh!

398
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:24,230
- What's the matter?
- My back! Crank it up!

399
00:24:24,314 --> 00:24:25,565
Crank it up!

400
00:24:25,648 --> 00:24:26,858
Does it hurt much?

401
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,027
I should hope so.
He's got a compressed vertebra.

402
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,904
- Oh?
- I've got what?

403
00:24:30,987 --> 00:24:32,947
Here, look at this. There's a compression

404
00:24:33,031 --> 00:24:34,908
of the fifth vertebra and a narrowed disk.

405
00:24:34,991 --> 00:24:36,409
Are you sure?

406
00:24:36,451 --> 00:24:38,328
Why do you think I'm wearing this outfit,
because I'm a barber?

407
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:40,079
Oh, I didn't mean to question
your competence.

408
00:24:40,163 --> 00:24:41,748
So don't kibitz!

409
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:45,502
Just relax. Tell me if this hurts.

415
00:24:56,012 --> 00:24:57,639
Take it easy, Doc.

416
00:24:57,722 --> 00:24:59,098
I said no kibitzing.

417
00:25:04,229 --> 00:25:05,897
Could I have that cigarette?

418
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:07,815
Cigarette? Is it all right if he smokes?

419
00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:09,776
Personally I gave it up,
but if you gotta smoke,

420
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:11,778
blow a little bit my way, eh?

421
00:25:22,372 --> 00:25:24,541
Why are you holding the cigarette like that?

422
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:26,626
The other fingers are sort of numb.

423
00:25:26,668 --> 00:25:27,877
Numb? Did you say numb?

424
00:25:28,002 --> 00:25:29,212
You heard him.

425
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:31,130
I don't understand. If he hurt his back,

426
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:33,049
what's that got to do with the fingers?

427
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:34,801
It's quite normal in a case like this.

428
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:36,803
The vertebra
must be pressing on the nerve ending.

429
00:25:36,886 --> 00:25:37,887
It all connects up.

430
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:38,972
Is that a fact?

431
00:25:39,013 --> 00:25:42,100
It's like a watch
that's been run over by a locomotive.

432
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:45,019
Imagine what happens to the
springs, the wheels, the balance.

433
00:25:45,436 --> 00:25:47,063
I guess I'm lucky I'm still ticking.

434
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:54,028
Tell me when this feels sharp
and when this feels dull.

435
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,991
Sharp! Sharp!

436
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:00,702
Dull. Dull.

437
00:26:01,411 --> 00:26:02,453
Sharp!

438
00:26:02,495 --> 00:26:03,496
Dull.

439
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,747
Sharp!

440
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:06,916
Sharp! Dull.

441
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,669
We got this trainer
on the team, Doc Murphy.

442
00:26:09,752 --> 00:26:12,005
He's just great with this kind of stuff,

443
00:26:12,046 --> 00:26:13,840
because us players,
we get clobbered all the time.

444
00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:14,882
Outside.

445
00:26:14,966 --> 00:26:17,427
He'll just give you a massage
and put you in a whirlpool.

446
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,761
I said out!

447
00:26:19,304 --> 00:26:20,680
You're Boom Boom Jackson.

448
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:22,223
Yeah. I brought you these.

449
00:26:22,307 --> 00:26:25,977
Thank you very much. Sister, would you
please put these in a vase?

450
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:28,896
Goodbye now. Bye.
You're very thoughtful. Goodbye.

451
00:26:30,273 --> 00:26:31,733
How'd the game come out?

452
00:26:31,816 --> 00:26:34,277
They kicked a field goal
in the last five seconds...

453
00:26:35,236 --> 00:26:37,280
...because I fumbled on the 12-yard-line.

454
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,199
It's tough.

455
00:26:42,577 --> 00:26:44,954
They're charging you for a second breakfast.

456
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:50,918
Ever had a previous back injury? Hmm?

457
00:26:51,336 --> 00:26:52,545
Maybe when you were a child?

458
00:26:53,087 --> 00:26:54,547
Uh, let me see.

459
00:26:55,882 --> 00:26:56,883
Um...

460
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,010
The phone.

461
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:01,220
Why doesn't one of you nurses
answer the phone?

462
00:27:01,304 --> 00:27:03,222
- What phone?
- It's ringing.

463
00:27:03,264 --> 00:27:04,682
How many nurses do you see?

464
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:08,144
Two.

465
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:09,562
Two?

466
00:27:09,604 --> 00:27:10,897
Can we afford 'em?

467
00:27:11,773 --> 00:27:14,359
Don't tell me this is normal, Doctor.

468
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:16,569
Somebody pull the shade down.

469
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:17,945
I'll do it.

470
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:28,122
Open your eyes wide. Look at him.

471
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,424
Hmm.

472
00:27:39,092 --> 00:27:40,134
Nice retina.

473
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:41,386
Thank you.

474
00:27:48,142 --> 00:27:49,936
What is it, Doc? Any brain damage?

475
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:51,771
Give it to us straight. We can take it.

476
00:27:51,854 --> 00:27:55,108
No. Just a simple concussion.
All he needs is a little bed rest.

477
00:27:55,149 --> 00:27:59,195
Thank God.
Actually, it's the back that's bothering me.

478
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:00,571
Bothering you?

479
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:02,448
I mean, with those nerves all connected up.

480
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:07,161
If it affects his hand, how do we know it
doesn't affect some other part of his body?

481
00:28:08,705 --> 00:28:10,748
If you don't mind,
I'm gonna have my breakfast.

482
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,999

484
00:28:20,591 --> 00:28:24,011
My leg! Got no feeling in my left leg!

485
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:25,555
Put him back in bed.

486
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:27,640
Careful now.

487
00:28:33,062 --> 00:28:36,274
Look, Doc, I don't wanna kibitz,
but I don't like the looks of this.

488
00:28:37,775 --> 00:28:40,820
I'm sorry, buddy.
I didn't mean to hurt you. Honest I didn't.

489
00:28:40,903 --> 00:28:42,655
I never hurt anybody in my life,

490
00:28:42,697 --> 00:28:44,365
not even when they played dirty.

491
00:28:44,449 --> 00:28:46,951
You couldn't help it.
It was just one of those things.

492
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:49,287
You're gonna get well, aren't you, buddy?

493
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:51,539
You gotta. You just gotta for me.

494
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,877
If you want a layman's opinion...

495
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,170
I do not.

496
00:28:57,795 --> 00:28:58,921
- Nurse.
- Yes.

497
00:28:59,005 --> 00:29:02,091
There must be a lower back injury
as well. Get ahold of Dr. Montgomery.

498
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:03,301
I'll want some more X-rays.

499
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:05,011
And let's get ready for an encephalogram,
an EMG,

500
00:29:05,094 --> 00:29:06,345
and if necessary a spinal tap.

501
00:29:06,387 --> 00:29:07,680
Yes, Doctor.

502
00:29:07,764 --> 00:29:09,432
Anything I can do?

503
00:29:09,515 --> 00:29:11,142
Pray for him, Sister.

504
00:29:32,163 --> 00:29:34,665
SECRETARY: O'Brien, Thompson,
and Kincaid. Good afternoon.

505
00:29:34,707 --> 00:29:38,377
Sorry, Mr. O'Brien is in conference
with Mr. Thompson and Mr. Kincaid.

506
00:29:39,003 --> 00:29:42,673
Oh, just a minute. Mr. O'Brien,
I know you're not to be disturbed,

507
00:29:42,715 --> 00:29:45,760
but it's Consolidated Insurance,
office of the vice president.

508
00:29:45,843 --> 00:29:47,386
All right. Put him through.

509
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:50,181
Yes, Mr. Dalrymple.

510
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,934
Of course we know it's a million dollars.

511
00:29:53,017 --> 00:29:55,520
Of course we know it isn't chicken feed.

512
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:59,899
Please, Mr. Dalrymple, you have three
grown-up lawyers handling this case.

513
00:29:59,982 --> 00:30:01,526
We have the hospital report right here,

514
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:04,111
and we have the Purkey
Investigating Agency working on it.

515
00:30:04,195 --> 00:30:06,864
So you just sit back
and leave the worrying to us.

516
00:30:08,115 --> 00:30:09,408
Go on, Mr. Purkey.

517
00:30:11,244 --> 00:30:14,330
In 1959, Harry Hinkle collected $18

518
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:17,083
for a raincoat he'd lost in a movie theater.

519
00:30:17,124 --> 00:30:21,420
The coat was ultimately recovered
and he returned the $18.

520
00:30:21,963 --> 00:30:24,924
Otherwise, there is no record
that Mr. Hinkle has ever filed a claim

521
00:30:25,007 --> 00:30:27,885
against any insurance company
in the United States.

522
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:30,304
I guess the young man is clean.

523
00:30:30,388 --> 00:30:32,181
Now, let's see. Who's his attorney?

524
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:34,559
- William Gingrich.
- Gingrich? Gingrich?

525
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,561
You know... Whiplash Willie?

526
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:38,187
Oh, him again.

527
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:40,606
Well, gentlemen, I guess our first step
is to have Hinkle

528
00:30:40,648 --> 00:30:42,358
examined by our own team of doctors.

529
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,485
For that, of course,
we need the consent of the plaintiff.

530
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:45,820
Get Gingrich on the phone.

531
00:30:45,903 --> 00:30:48,614
He's not only Hinkle's lawyer,
he's his brother-in-law.

532
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:51,534
Honey, get me William Gingrich.

533
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:53,077
I think his office is somewhere
in this building.

534
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:59,959
Now, tell me, Mr. Cimoli,
exactly how did you break your hip?

535
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:01,377
It's my pelvis!

536
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,462
All right, your pelvis. How did it happen?

537
00:31:03,504 --> 00:31:06,924
I was coming out this store.
And there it was on the sidewalk.

538
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:08,134
What?

539
00:31:10,511 --> 00:31:11,512
This.

540
00:31:11,596 --> 00:31:14,348
I see. You were coming out of what store?

541
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:17,476
Nat's Delicatessen on Euclid Avenue.

542
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,562
- Too bad.
- Oh, such pain!

543
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:20,813
I mean, too bad it didn't happen

544
00:31:20,897 --> 00:31:22,648
further down the street
in front of the May Company.

545
00:31:22,732 --> 00:31:24,066
From them you can collect.

546
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:27,153
Couldn't you have dragged yourself
another 20 feet?

547
00:31:27,236 --> 00:31:28,905
(TELEPHONE RINGS)

548
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,865
Hello.

549
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:34,660
Speaking. O'Brien, Thompson, and Kincaid?

550
00:31:34,702 --> 00:31:36,871
Yes. What can I do for you?

551
00:31:36,954 --> 00:31:41,000
The Hinkle case? Oh, yes, I'm handling that.

552
00:31:42,043 --> 00:31:45,254
I can't talk right now.
I have an office full of people.

553
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:49,008
Suppose I come up to your place. Right.

554
00:31:49,842 --> 00:31:52,511
Say, how much you think
my pelvis is worth?

555
00:31:52,553 --> 00:31:55,723
By itself, nothing,
so it's a good thing you came to me.

556
00:31:55,806 --> 00:31:56,807
Before we're through with them,

557
00:31:56,849 --> 00:31:58,851
we'll have them begging for mercy.

558
00:31:58,893 --> 00:32:00,186
Who's them?

559
00:32:00,227 --> 00:32:01,854
That I haven't figured out yet.

560
00:32:01,896 --> 00:32:04,148
But don't go away. I'll think of an angle.

561
00:32:09,862 --> 00:32:12,907
This guy is so full of angles
and gimmicks and twists,

562
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,576
he starts to describe a donut
and it comes out a pretzel.

563
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,996
Nevertheless, when he gets here,
I suggest we try the friendly approach.

564
00:32:19,121 --> 00:32:21,207
Okay. After you shake hands with him,

565
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,376
I suggest you count your fingers.

566
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:24,961
I'd better get out of here.

567
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:27,046
Purkey, I want you to keep digging away.

568
00:32:27,088 --> 00:32:28,214
My pleasure.

569
00:32:28,923 --> 00:32:32,718
I'd like to dig a nice, deep hole
for our friend Gingrich.

Nothin'.

579
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:08,212
Go right in, Mr. Gingrich.

580
00:33:08,254 --> 00:33:10,256
Thanks. Take the rest of the afternoon off.

581
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:13,884
- Gentlemen.
- Ah, Mr. Gingrich.

582
00:33:13,926 --> 00:33:16,429
I've heard a lot about you.
Sit down. Sit down.

583
00:33:16,512 --> 00:33:21,017
Say, you each have an office
like this, or do you all bunk together?

584
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,935
The reason we called you up here,
Mr. Gingrich...

585
00:33:23,019 --> 00:33:24,228
Let me guess.

586
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:25,938
- You want to settle.
- Settle?

587
00:33:26,022 --> 00:33:27,273
- You don't want to settle.
- Certainly not.

588
00:33:27,314 --> 00:33:29,608
- That settles that.
- You've got no case, Gingrich.

589
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:31,777
It's a simple matter
of workmen's compensation.

590
00:33:31,861 --> 00:33:33,154
It's a simple matter of negligence.

591
00:33:33,237 --> 00:33:35,614
That tarpaulin
should have been rolled back 50 feet.

592
00:33:35,656 --> 00:33:38,284
And it's gonna cost you $20,000 per foot.

593
00:33:38,325 --> 00:33:41,662
Rubbish!
All the legal precedents are on our side.

594
00:33:41,746 --> 00:33:46,292
That so? What about
<i>Fishbein vs. the Empire State Building?</i>

595
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:47,460
What about it?

596
00:33:47,543 --> 00:33:54,341
You'll find it in volume 16,
New York supplement 2, page 45, 1939.

597
00:33:54,425 --> 00:33:58,512
A window washer, 61st floor.
The safety belt broke, and...

598
00:33:58,596 --> 00:34:02,224
As a window washer, Mr. Fishbein
was taking a normal occupational risk.

599
00:34:02,308 --> 00:34:03,976
The window washer's name was Jones.

600
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:07,855
Mr. Fishbein was a pedestrian
walking innocently down 34th Street.

601
00:34:07,938 --> 00:34:11,192
And the next thing he knew,
he was splattered all over the sidewalk.

602
00:34:11,275 --> 00:34:13,819
The widow sued, was awarded $85,000.

603
00:34:13,903 --> 00:34:15,529
Case appealed. Judgment upheld.

604
00:34:15,613 --> 00:34:18,240
Volume 259, Appellate Division, page 56.

605
00:34:18,324 --> 00:34:24,205
Also volume 24, New York supplement 2,
page 168, 1940.

606
00:34:24,288 --> 00:34:26,499
Maybe in New York
they throw money around like that.

607
00:34:26,582 --> 00:34:30,586
All right. What about <i>Mrs. Cunningham</i>
<i>vs. Baltimore and Ohio Railroad?</i>

608
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:34,673
U.S. District Court,
eastern district of Ohio, number 8927.

609
00:34:34,715 --> 00:34:37,384
Mrs. Cunningham,
en route to Cincinnati to visit dying uncle,

610
00:34:37,468 --> 00:34:39,929
gets trapped in the toilet
on account of a faulty lock.

611
00:34:40,012 --> 00:34:41,555
The car is hitched to another train.

612
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,016
Mrs. Cunningham
winds up in San Bernardino, California.

613
00:34:44,058 --> 00:34:47,019
By this time the uncle is dead,
and she's cut out of the will.

614
00:34:47,061 --> 00:34:50,689
So she sues the railroad for damages.
Does this ring a bell?

615
00:34:50,731 --> 00:34:51,857
Never heard of it.

616
00:34:51,941 --> 00:34:53,025
You mean, none of you has?

617
00:34:53,067 --> 00:34:55,861
Because you gentlemen
represented the railroad.

618
00:34:55,945 --> 00:34:57,738
- We did?
- And lost the case.

619
00:34:59,365 --> 00:35:01,534
Suppose we get back to the Hinkle case.

620
00:35:01,575 --> 00:35:03,577
You guys should really
bone up on negligence.

621
00:35:03,661 --> 00:35:05,412
We've been going over the hospital report.

622
00:35:05,496 --> 00:35:06,580
Discouraging, isn't it?

623
00:35:06,664 --> 00:35:08,541
Naturally, we don't accept it at face value.

624
00:35:08,624 --> 00:35:09,708
I wouldn't, either.

625
00:35:10,334 --> 00:35:12,837
Look, Gingrich. Let's stop horsing around.

626
00:35:12,878 --> 00:35:14,922
We demand the right
to have our own doctors examine Hinkle.

627
00:35:15,005 --> 00:35:16,006
You got it.

628
00:35:16,048 --> 00:35:17,925
Unless you agree to it,
we'll get a court order and force you.

629
00:35:18,008 --> 00:35:19,969
- I agree to it.
- Now don't give us any trouble, Gingrich.

630
00:35:20,052 --> 00:35:21,971
We know your reputation. We...

631
00:35:22,596 --> 00:35:24,431
What do you mean, you agree to it?

632
00:35:24,515 --> 00:35:25,599
Permission granted.

633
00:35:25,683 --> 00:35:26,892
You have no objections?

634
00:35:26,934 --> 00:35:29,061
As a matter of fact, I insist on it.

635
00:35:29,103 --> 00:35:32,148
To you gentlemen,
it's just a question of money,

636
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:35,234
but to me it's a personal tragedy...

637
00:35:35,317 --> 00:35:39,655
My kid brother-in-law,
possibly disabled for life.

638
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:42,032
I'm sure you gentlemen
will bring in the best doctors,

639
00:35:42,074 --> 00:35:44,535
the kind of specialists
we could never afford.

640
00:35:44,577 --> 00:35:46,745
Maybe you'll even send him
to the Mayo Clinic.

641
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:50,583
Don't worry.
Mr. Hinkle will get a thorough going-over.

642
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:52,918
Good. Will there be
anything else, gentlemen?

643
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,253
I can't think of anything.

644
00:35:54,295 --> 00:35:58,048
Well, I can. If you're to examine my client,
you'll need written consent.

645
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,967
Yes, of course. Get Miss Heffelfinger in here.

646
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:03,179
Don't bother.
I have the authorizations right here.

647
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:07,057
Three copies, all signed and notarized.

648
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:08,642
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

649
00:36:08,726 --> 00:36:12,188
If you'll excuse me,
I have somebody waiting in my office.

650
00:36:13,606 --> 00:36:16,942
Interesting case. I'm considering
suing the United Fruit Company.

651
00:36:17,026 --> 00:36:19,403
There should be
a printed warning on every banana peel.

Those things can be hazardous
to your health. Carry on, gentlemen.

00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:53,122
Why?

679
00:37:55,332 --> 00:37:56,500
That's why.

680

Where did you find it?

681
00:38:04,591 --> 00:38:08,262
Where you stashed it. Top shelf of your
closet behind the 78 records.

682
00:38:11,015 --> 00:38:14,476
Remember that day? It was July 4th.

683
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,895
Some wise guy
put a firecracker under our bed.

684
00:38:16,937 --> 00:38:18,397
Don't look at me.

685
00:38:18,981 --> 00:38:20,566
Check my son's alibi.

686
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:24,945
Why hasn't she called yet?
You said she'd call.

687
00:38:25,029 --> 00:38:27,364
That's what she said,
but it's only been a few days.

688
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:28,407
Maybe she won't call at all.

689
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,491
Maybe she won't.

690
00:38:29,575 --> 00:38:31,035
What do you mean, she won't?

691
00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:34,288
Maybe she's so anxious to see you
she's on a train right now or a plane.

692
00:38:34,371 --> 00:38:36,623
Maybe that door will open
and she'll just walk in.

Harry? (GASPS)

696
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,428
Hello, Mother. Hi, Charlotte.

697
00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:52,723
My poor baby! What have they done to you?

698
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:55,934
He's wearing a corset, Mother.
Everybody wears a corset.

699
00:38:55,976 --> 00:38:58,103
You wear a corset. Charlotte wears a corset.

700
00:38:58,145 --> 00:38:59,355
I wear a girdle!

701

Don't fight, please.

702
00:39:00,606 --> 00:39:04,276
I brought you some mushroom soup
and some hot biscuits.

703
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,445
Forget it. I ordered him a Chinese lunch.

704
00:39:06,487 --> 00:39:07,488
A Chinese lunch?

705
00:39:07,571 --> 00:39:10,074
I spent the whole morning in the kitchen.

706
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:11,575
I'll have it for dinner.

707
00:39:11,617 --> 00:39:13,952
Mother, you're upsetting everybody.

708
00:39:13,994 --> 00:39:15,579
You shouldn't be at the hospital.

709
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:17,790
You should be in Florida.
Four weeks in the sun...

710
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:20,709
Go away and leave Harry like that?
I couldn't.

711
00:39:20,793 --> 00:39:22,586
Don't worry, Mother. I'll take care of him.

712
00:39:22,628 --> 00:39:25,172
Look, I've already got your ticket.
Your plane leaves tomorrow noon.

713
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:27,132
I'll drive you to the airport
in the new Mustang.

714
00:39:28,592 --> 00:39:30,844
- What new Mustang?
- Your new Mustang.

715
00:39:30,928 --> 00:39:33,639
But since you're in no condition
to drive, I'm breaking it in for you.

716
00:39:34,223 --> 00:39:35,516
Gee, that's big of you!

717
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,434
- What's your favorite color?
- Red.

718
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:39,436
Damn it! I hope you don't mind.

719
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:41,939
I got it in beige
to match Charlotte's fur coat.

720
00:39:42,523 --> 00:39:44,149
- What?
- It's kit fox.

721
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:46,318
The hat goes with it. You like it?

722
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,820
He loves it.

723
00:39:47,903 --> 00:39:49,696
Florida and Mustangs and foxes.

724
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,156
How are we gonna pay for all this?

725
00:39:51,198 --> 00:39:52,991
Our credit is good.

726
00:39:53,033 --> 00:39:56,370
Well, don't you think we better wait
till we see some of that insurance money?

727
00:39:56,453 --> 00:39:59,706
Wait? Who waits nowadays?
Take the government.

728
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:02,292
When they shoot a billion dollars'
worth of hardware into space,

729
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:03,544
you think they pay cash?

What's she doing here?

If you must know, Mother,
they're still crazy about each other.

734

As a matter of fact,
she may be here any minute.

mistake again after what she did to you.

I brought you a present.

It's got three speeds, left-hand drive,

That's some chariot.
Do they make a two-seater?

00:41:05,189 --> 00:41:06,982
And here's a little idea I had.

754
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:09,610
You can mount it on the chair,
and any time you need something...

needing this chair, I wish it was me.

walk again someday.

read that stuff, too?

00:45:10,684 --> 00:45:13,270
I just hope they don't give me a saliva test.

850
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:15,313
Step on it, Doc. We've still
got Sam the hypnotist coming.

851
00:45:15,397 --> 00:45:16,440
Sam the who?

852
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:17,607
Just a little posthypnotic suggestion.

853
00:45:17,649 --> 00:45:20,152
You're gonna have such symptoms
like you wouldn't believe.

854
00:45:20,235 --> 00:45:23,572
Find a nice freckle, Doc,
so the puncture won't show.

855
00:45:23,655 --> 00:45:26,158
All righty now, just relax.

856
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:27,284
Ow!

857
00:45:27,826 --> 00:45:29,703
What if I get an infection from this?

858
00:45:29,786 --> 00:45:32,330
So we sue the hospital
for using dirty needles.

859
00:45:32,372 --> 00:45:33,749
Now the leg, Doc.

860
00:45:39,004 --> 00:45:41,506
Hurry up, Doc. The nurse is coming.

861
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,176
I'm looking for a freckle.

862
00:45:49,473 --> 00:45:50,682
HARRY: Ow!

863
00:45:52,434 --> 00:45:54,978
I used my influence in the kitchen.

864
00:45:58,523 --> 00:46:00,358
Uh, he's...

865
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,278
We lost a shrimp somewhere.

866
00:46:04,488 --> 00:46:06,823
I don't want that. Would you take it away?
Take everything away.

867
00:46:06,865 --> 00:46:08,116
Are you sure?

868
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,493
You eat it.

869
00:46:09,534 --> 00:46:12,120
Don't you even want
the fortune cookie? Come on.

870
00:46:12,204 --> 00:46:14,456
You've got to open your fortune cookie.

871
00:46:21,755 --> 00:46:23,006
Um...

872
00:46:23,048 --> 00:46:24,216
What does it say?

873
00:46:24,257 --> 00:46:26,343
"You can fool
all of the people some of the time,

874
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:27,886
"and some of the people all of the time..."

875
00:46:27,969 --> 00:46:29,221
Let me see that.

876
00:46:36,228 --> 00:46:39,231

Squeeze.

879
00:46:51,117 --> 00:46:52,118
Push.

880
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:54,913
- Feel this?
- Mmm-hmm.

881
00:46:55,413 --> 00:46:56,498
How about this?

882
00:46:57,749 --> 00:46:58,959
E flat?

883
00:47:00,001 --> 00:47:02,921
Well, gentlemen, the evidence
seems to be quite clear.

884
00:47:02,963 --> 00:47:05,257
There are obvious indications
of nerve trauma.

885
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:06,550
Obviously.

886
00:47:06,591 --> 00:47:07,759
I concur.

887
00:47:07,801 --> 00:47:10,262
And what is your learned opinion,
Professor Winterhalter?

888
00:47:10,345 --> 00:47:14,599
I have not formulated an opinion yet,
but I have formulated a hunch.

889
00:47:15,267 --> 00:47:16,351
Oh?

890
00:47:17,602 --> 00:47:18,645
Fake.

891
00:47:20,939 --> 00:47:21,940
Oh.

892
00:47:26,278 --> 00:47:27,445
It's a freckle.

893
00:47:34,244 --> 00:47:35,245
Pull.

894
00:47:38,498 --> 00:47:40,000
Left hand, 80.

895
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:42,085
Right hand.

896
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:46,631
- Two.
- Two?

897
00:47:46,715 --> 00:47:48,925
There's a pronounced discrepancy
in the reflexes.

898
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:50,260
Indubitably.

899
00:47:50,302 --> 00:47:52,512
We seem to be confronted
with a classic syndrome.

900
00:47:52,596 --> 00:47:54,764
Wouldn't you say so,
Professor Winterhalter?

901
00:47:54,806 --> 00:47:58,018
I once saw a similar case in Zurich.

902
00:47:58,101 --> 00:47:59,102
Oh?

903
00:48:00,645 --> 00:48:01,855
Also fake.

904
00:48:02,814 --> 00:48:03,815
Oh.

905
00:48:09,487 --> 00:48:12,991
Fascinating, isn't it? The way we can
now corroborate subjective symptoms.

906
00:48:13,658 --> 00:48:15,619
It's a new technique
they developed in Rochester.

907
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:18,997
I know. I read all about it in <i>Time</i> magazine.

908
00:48:20,957 --> 00:48:22,584
Well, gentlemen, I think we must agree

909
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:24,336
that our findings are not inconsistent

910
00:48:24,377 --> 00:48:27,589
with an exacerbation
of the median nerve in the lumbar plexus.

911
00:48:27,672 --> 00:48:29,049
SPECIALIST: I agree.

912
00:48:29,132 --> 00:48:30,508
SPECIALIST 2: So do I.

913
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:34,888
Are we then unanimous in our evaluation,
Professor Winterhalter?

914
00:48:34,971 --> 00:48:35,972
Fake!

915
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,311
All these newfangled machines.

916
00:48:41,353 --> 00:48:43,229
Fake! They prove nothing.

917
00:48:44,147 --> 00:48:47,359
In the old days,
we used to do these things better.

918
00:48:47,442 --> 00:48:50,862
A man says he's paralyzed,
we simply throw him in the snake pit.

919
00:48:50,946 --> 00:48:53,365
If he climbs out, then we know he's lying.

920
00:48:55,867 --> 00:48:57,035
And if he doesn't climb out?

921
00:48:57,786 --> 00:49:01,790
Then we have lost a patient,
but we have found an honest man.

922
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:06,378
Wait a minute, you guys.
You're not throwing me in any pit!

923
00:49:06,419 --> 00:49:09,673

Just one little snake!

We know you're a busy man, Gingrich.
We're pretty busy, too.

948
00:50:34,549 --> 00:50:37,927
So, why bother with something
as trifling as this Hinkle case?

949
00:50:37,969 --> 00:50:39,637
It may drag through the courts for months.

950
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:43,683
What I mean is, we wouldn't be
adverse to discussing a settlement.

I'd like to have
a matching tie and handkerchief.

Nothing flashy. Maybe something like this.

953
00:50:50,398 --> 00:50:51,775
Sorry. You were saying?

954
00:50:52,108 --> 00:50:54,694
In return for a release from all future claims,

955
00:50:54,778 --> 00:50:58,364
we're willing to compensate
your client with a lump sum.

956
00:50:58,448 --> 00:51:00,366
Say $2,000. Fair enough?

957
00:51:01,076 --> 00:51:02,952
It may be fair, but it's not enough.

958
00:51:02,994 --> 00:51:06,998
I had a slightly
different figure in mind. Say, $500,000?

959
00:51:08,249 --> 00:51:10,168
$500,000?

960
00:51:10,251 --> 00:51:11,961
You're being grotesque.

as one member of the Bar to another,

Look, Mr. O'Brien,
I don't want to be unreasonable.

964
00:51:20,095 --> 00:51:22,972
You say $2,000. I say $500,000.

965

Tell you what. Let's split it down the middle.

966
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:29,646
All right. If he wants
a knockdown fight, we'll give it to him.

967

And no compromise!

I'm with you.

969

Now, wait a minute. We can't go
in front of a jury with this kind of evidence.

We're not in front of a jury yet.

Hinkle under surveillance.

He can't keep up this act much longer.

974
00:51:43,034 --> 00:51:44,953
Sooner or later he's bound to crack.

975
00:51:45,036 --> 00:51:46,704
He's getting out of the hospital tomorrow.

976

That's nice.

1021

You'll be better off staying with us,
helpless as you are.

1022
00:53:50,161 --> 00:53:52,163
Watch it. Somebody may walk
through that door any minute.

- You bet! And it's gonna be me!
- Harry...

1024
00:53:54,499 --> 00:53:57,835
I'm walking out of here on my own
two feet and without this damn corset!

1025
00:53:57,919 --> 00:54:00,380
Are you crazy?
After all we've gone through?

1026
00:54:00,463 --> 00:54:02,465
We've got them over a barrel now.
They're already trying to settle.

1027
00:54:02,507 --> 00:54:05,677
You seen the way that guy looks at me?
I'm letting him off the hook.

1028
00:54:05,718 --> 00:54:07,553
Harry, you walk out of here,
they'll get you for fraud.

What about all the money I've spent?

1031

Oh!

1032
00:54:13,601 --> 00:54:15,395
I'm sure you'll think of something.

1033
00:54:15,478 --> 00:54:17,522
I did think of something,
but you're fighting it!

1034
00:54:17,605 --> 00:54:19,691
What's the matter?
You afraid of a little prosperity?

1035
00:54:19,774 --> 00:54:21,234

Yeah? Hold on.

1039
00:54:28,241 --> 00:54:30,618
A born loser. You want to know
why you lost your wife?

1040
00:54:30,702 --> 00:54:32,787
Because you've got no character, no guts.

1041
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:35,081
I'm surprised it didn't show up in the X-rays.

No brains!

about how I'm gonna get Sandy back.

Well, I don't want any part of her,
not anymore.

shacked up with that guy there...

Not so loud. Do you want her to hear?

1047
00:54:51,389 --> 00:54:53,433
It's Sandy. Shall I hang up?

1048
00:54:55,435 --> 00:54:58,021
Get back in that chair.

1049
00:55:01,232 --> 00:55:02,442
Yeah, Sandy?

1050
00:55:03,151 --> 00:55:05,570
Yes, he's coming along all right.

1051
00:55:06,195 --> 00:55:09,032
Well, he has his bad spells once in a while,

1052
00:55:09,073 --> 00:55:11,534
but the doctors think he'll walk again.

1053
00:55:12,243 --> 00:55:15,830
Poor bastard. I just hope
he winds up with a little money.

1054
00:55:15,913 --> 00:55:18,583
But with you handling the case,
I know he will.

1055
00:55:20,501 --> 00:55:21,878
Here he is.

1056
00:55:25,798 --> 00:55:27,425
Hello, Sandy?

1057
00:55:28,301 --> 00:55:30,303
Yes, it's me. Why are you so surprised?

1058
00:55:30,386 --> 00:55:33,723
Well, I only called Willie
to find out how you were.

1059
00:55:33,765 --> 00:55:36,976
I didn't really think you'd want to talk
to me ever again,

I'm being discharged
from the hospital today.

1064
00:55:48,613 --> 00:55:51,866
I guess there's nothing more
they can do for me here.

1065
00:55:52,283 --> 00:55:53,618
Where are you going to go?

1066
00:55:56,037 --> 00:55:57,997
Sure I care.

1067
00:55:58,081 --> 00:56:00,416
I figure I'll just go back to the apartment.

1068
00:56:01,292 --> 00:56:02,877
You remember our old apartment?

1069
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,129
Of course I do.

1070
00:56:05,171 --> 00:56:07,799
You still have that ugly
brown velveteen couch?

1071
00:56:11,302 --> 00:56:13,846
And those two sets
of mother-of-pearl demitasse spoons

1072
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:16,099
we got for a wedding present?

1073
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:19,435
And that cat?
What was her name... Tinker Bell?

1074
00:56:19,852 --> 00:56:22,522
Everything is just the same, except the cat.

1075
00:56:22,605 --> 00:56:25,525
She ran away, too. There must be
something the matter with me.

1076
00:56:25,733 --> 00:56:27,360
Don't say that.

1077
00:56:27,443 --> 00:56:29,612
Maybe there's something
the matter with Tinker Bell.

1078
00:56:31,364 --> 00:56:33,741
Harry, I was wondering...

1079
00:56:33,825 --> 00:56:35,159
Who's gonna look after you?

1080
00:56:35,243 --> 00:56:37,036
Mother's in Florida.

1081
00:56:37,537 --> 00:56:40,540
Maybe Charlotte will drop by,
bring me some mushroom soup.

1082
00:56:40,623 --> 00:56:43,292
I could get myself a babysitter
once in a while.

1083
00:56:44,293 --> 00:56:48,005
Harry, do you want me
to come and sit with you?

1084
00:56:48,548 --> 00:56:50,007
Just say yes or no.

1085
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:53,469
Well, naturally the answer's yes.

1086
00:56:53,511 --> 00:56:55,346
It's always nice to see an old roommate.

1087
00:56:57,515 --> 00:57:00,351
But if it's in any way awkward...

1088
00:57:00,393 --> 00:57:02,645
I mean, I don't know your situation.

1089
00:57:02,687 --> 00:57:06,732

What if I can get away for a few days?

Coming.

1092
00:57:11,863 --> 00:57:13,489
All right then, I'll see you Monday.

Where'd you learn that? Don't tell me.

1185
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:52,703
Your father was a Pullman porter.

1186
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:55,164
He was a fighter, light heavyweight.

1187
01:02:55,206 --> 01:02:56,749
Once went 12 rounds with Billy Conn.

1188
01:02:56,832 --> 01:02:58,000
Say!

1189
01:02:58,042 --> 01:03:00,711
He was really going places,
then he killed a guy in the ring.

1190
01:03:00,753 --> 01:03:04,048
A blood clot or something.
He never fought again after that.

1191
01:03:04,089 --> 01:03:05,382
Just started hitting the bottle.

1192
01:03:05,674 --> 01:03:06,801
That's a shame.

1193
01:03:06,884 --> 01:03:10,262
He pulled out okay. As a matter of fact,
we're in business together.

1194
01:03:10,346 --> 01:03:13,891
I bought this bowling alley on the east side,
and he's running it for me.

1195
01:03:13,974 --> 01:03:17,269
It's got 12 lanes and a cocktail bar,
and it's half paid off.

1196
01:03:17,353 --> 01:03:19,438
All I need is another
three good seasons of pro ball.

1197
01:03:20,981 --> 01:03:24,068
Boom Boom, what happened
to you yesterday?

1198
01:03:24,151 --> 01:03:26,362
- Yesterday?
- I watched the game on television.

1199
01:03:27,238 --> 01:03:30,074
I guess I wasn't very sharp,
so they benched me.

1200
01:03:30,157 --> 01:03:32,243
Anybody can have a bad afternoon.

1201
01:03:34,578 --> 01:03:36,121
You aren't drinking, are you?

1202
01:03:36,539 --> 01:03:38,499
Me? No, sir.

1203
01:03:38,582 --> 01:03:42,336
Maybe a beer now and then,
but I can't take the hard stuff.

1204
01:03:44,338 --> 01:03:49,260
<i>You'd be so nice to come home...</i>

1205
01:03:49,301 --> 01:03:52,012
You know who that is? Sandy.

1206
01:03:52,096 --> 01:03:55,140
<i>So nice</i>

1207
01:03:55,224 --> 01:03:58,143

<i>While the breeze on high...</i>

1209
01:04:02,064 --> 01:04:04,275
I didn't know she was a singer.

1210
01:04:04,316 --> 01:04:05,359
She always wanted to be.

1211
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:08,112
That was our problem.

1212
01:04:08,153 --> 01:04:11,282
When we were first married,
she was working at WJW,

1213
01:04:11,323 --> 01:04:14,535
doing singing commercials
for a linoleum company.

1214
01:04:14,618 --> 01:04:16,161
There was this band...

1215
01:04:17,288 --> 01:04:20,249
Gus Gilroy and his Gaslighters.

1216
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:24,336
She...cut an audition record with them.

1217
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:28,382
The next thing I knew, she'd run off
to New York with that Gilroy character.

1218
01:04:28,465 --> 01:04:30,467
She was gonna make it big.

1219
01:04:30,509 --> 01:04:31,552
Did she?

1220
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:33,762
If she did, the news
hasn't reached Cleveland.

1221

<i>...home to and love</i>

1222
01:04:37,433 --> 01:04:41,437
I tried for a year, very hard,
to get her out of my mind.

1223
01:04:41,478 --> 01:04:45,649
I worked at it day and night.
I figured I'd never see her again.

1224
01:04:46,358 --> 01:04:50,195
Just imagine, right now
she's stepping on an airplane in New York,

1225
01:04:50,279 --> 01:04:52,907
and in a few minutes,
she's going to take off.

wear out your batteries.

Now, cut it out! You're not a well man.

1234

I've been trying to reach you
all morning. Where you been?

1235
01:06:30,671 --> 01:06:32,423
Where have I been?

1236
01:06:33,215 --> 01:06:36,927
I've been working, talking to witnesses,

1237
01:06:36,969 --> 01:06:39,888
getting depositions,
looking out for your interests.

1238
01:06:40,514 --> 01:06:44,727
I've interviewed every person who was
sitting between the 20 and 40-yard lines,

1239
01:06:44,768 --> 01:06:47,604
gotten signed statements
from groundskeepers,

1240
01:06:47,688 --> 01:06:49,648
looked at miles of television tape,

1241
01:06:49,857 --> 01:06:52,693
instant replays, isolated camera.

1242
01:06:57,531 --> 01:07:00,951
In this business, you gotta be
on your toes every minute,

1243
01:07:01,035 --> 01:07:03,120
thinking, anticipating,

always keeping one step ahead
of the other guy.

1245
01:07:05,664 --> 01:07:08,292
I thought you could pick Sandy up.
She's coming in at 3:40.

1246
01:07:08,333 --> 01:07:13,380
Good for you.
I can't wait to see that pretty puss again.

1247
01:07:13,464 --> 01:07:15,299
Why doesn't Boom Boom pick her up, huh?

1248
01:07:15,382 --> 01:07:16,925
- Boom Boom?
- Be glad to.

1249
01:07:16,967 --> 01:07:19,595
Sure, 3:40 breaks up the whole afternoon.

1250
01:07:20,554 --> 01:07:23,348
There are a lot of important things
I have to take care of.

1251
01:07:23,432 --> 01:07:24,725
He doesn't know what she looks like.

1252
01:07:24,808 --> 01:07:26,685
Don't worry.
I won't bring you the wrong wife.

1253
01:07:39,907 --> 01:07:41,992
Sure is nice and warm here.

1254
01:07:42,034 --> 01:07:43,118
Yeah.

1255
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,953
Somebody from the building came up,

1256
01:07:44,995 --> 01:07:46,747
checked the radiators in every room.

1257
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:50,751
Every room? Well, isn't that considerate?

1258
01:07:51,835 --> 01:07:53,921
I think they suspect something.

1259
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:58,467
I told you not to plant
those mikes in the radiators.

1260
01:07:58,509 --> 01:08:00,469
I suppose your idea was better?

1261
01:08:00,511 --> 01:08:03,555
Send him a box of candy
and bug the chocolate creams.

1262

01:08:04,765 --> 01:08:07,518
Don't come unglued. We're okay.

for the airport, Boom Boom.

Okay, Coach.

01:08:17,694 --> 01:08:20,030
What's the rush?
He's got an hour and a half.

1267
01:08:20,197 --> 01:08:23,367
Well, there's a lot of traffic this time of day.

1268
01:08:23,408 --> 01:08:27,412
And those planes...
You never know. They're late. They're early.

1269
01:08:29,581 --> 01:08:33,544
Say, what do I call her?
"Mrs. Hinkle" or "Miss" or what?

1270
01:08:34,211 --> 01:08:35,337
Try "Mrs."

01:08:35,379 --> 01:08:36,588
You got it.

What do I know?

1276
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:57,276
It's very important, especially the footnote.

1277
01:09:08,912 --> 01:09:10,539
Isn't that interesting?

1278
01:09:11,582 --> 01:09:14,626
- I don't get it.
- Take my word for it.

You can't just go blithely skipping through
the wood like Little Red Riding Hood.

01:09:28,473 --> 01:09:29,516
Oh.

1285
01:09:30,267 --> 01:09:31,727
And big teeth.

1286
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:33,896
- He forgot the teeth.
- He what?

1287
01:09:33,937 --> 01:09:37,441
I hate a guy who tells a story
and louses up the punch line.

1288
01:09:38,525 --> 01:09:43,822
So the moral of the story is better
Red Riding Hood than dead Riding Hood.

- The Jacuzzi?
- Yeah.

01:09:59,755 --> 01:10:00,756
Does it help you any?

1294
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:04,426
I suppose. It tones
the muscles up or something.

1295
01:10:04,468 --> 01:10:07,471
But just exactly how does it work?

1296
01:10:07,512 --> 01:10:09,973
Well, first you got to run some water
in the tub.

1297
01:10:10,015 --> 01:10:11,266
Alrighty.

1298
01:10:21,693 --> 01:10:24,321
Say, where's the switch
on this Jacuzzi thing?

1299
01:10:24,363 --> 01:10:26,615
No switch. Just plug it in the wall.

1300
01:10:26,657 --> 01:10:28,617
You better come in and show me.

1301
01:10:37,292 --> 01:10:39,253

I could have stepped out of bounds.

I could have cut back
and reversed my field, but I didn't.

for that extra five yards, and, well,

1351
01:13:41,101 --> 01:13:43,270
sometimes people get in our way.

1352
01:13:46,356 --> 01:13:47,858
Harry played me your record.

1353
01:13:49,693 --> 01:13:50,861
You sing good.

1354
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:54,990
I sing damn good,
if you must know, but I started off wrong,

1355
01:13:55,031 --> 01:13:57,701
working with a cheap band
in some crummy cellar.

1356
01:13:57,742 --> 01:14:00,454
To make it these days, you need exposure.

1357
01:14:00,537 --> 01:14:01,663
You need what?

1358
01:14:01,705 --> 01:14:02,956
A showcase.

1359
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:05,208
Like the Copa or the Persian Room.

1360
01:14:05,292 --> 01:14:07,002
And for that, you need a knockout wardrobe

1361
01:14:07,127 --> 01:14:08,879
and arrangements and special material

1362
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,755
and a vocal coach and a publicity man.

1363
01:14:10,839 --> 01:14:15,635
And for that, you need money. So unless
you got, like, 20,000 bucks, forget it.

1364
01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:16,803
Maybe it's all for the best.

1365
01:14:16,887 --> 01:14:18,722
Because now that you're here,
maybe you'll decide to stay.

1366
01:14:20,223 --> 01:14:23,894
Sure, and go back to doing
those linoleum commercials.

1367
01:14:24,936 --> 01:14:27,272
I was talking about going back to Harry.

1368
01:14:28,523 --> 01:14:31,526
You know, you and me... We both hurt him.

1369
01:14:31,568 --> 01:14:33,403
Except I can't do anything about it,

1370
01:14:33,487 --> 01:14:35,405
but it's not too late for you to square things.

1371
01:14:36,364 --> 01:14:38,074
We'll see what happens.

1372
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:43,538
When you travel with a football team,
you live with a lot of guys,

1373
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:45,248
but Harry is something else again.

1374
01:14:45,290 --> 01:14:47,250
You don't have to sell me.

1375
01:14:48,752 --> 01:14:51,087
You should have seen him
when your telegram came.

1376
01:14:51,171 --> 01:14:53,089
He almost jumped out of that chair.

1377
01:14:53,131 --> 01:14:55,133
All Mr. Gingrich talks about is the money,

1378
01:14:55,217 --> 01:14:57,052
but all Harry talks about is you.

1379
01:14:57,135 --> 01:15:00,096
That's just like him,
sweet and practical Harry.

1380
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:03,058
If he had his way,
nobody would get anything out of this.

Keep your mind on business.

1385
01:16:19,843 --> 01:16:22,220
This is business. It's the wife.

1386
01:16:27,434 --> 01:16:31,146
I'd sure hate to be
stuck in a wheelchair with her around.

1387
01:16:35,025 --> 01:16:36,693
You got enough film in the camera?

1388
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:38,153
Sure. Why?

1389
01:16:38,194 --> 01:16:39,696
Because if we're lucky,

1390
01:16:39,738 --> 01:16:41,865
this may turn out to be
our Swedish masseuse.

HARRY: Hi, Sandy.

1392
01:17:07,307 --> 01:17:08,767
Have a good flight?

1393
01:17:10,852 --> 01:17:11,853
Harry!

1394
01:17:14,314 --> 01:17:16,274
If I were a gentleman, I'd get up.

01:17:29,829 --> 01:17:31,456
What do I remind you of?

1398
01:17:32,415 --> 01:17:33,917
I don't know.

1399
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,418
I'll give you a hint.

1401
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,672
I still don't know.

1404
01:17:49,265 --> 01:17:52,394
What happened? You got green eyes.

1405
01:17:52,435 --> 01:17:56,898
It's the contact lenses.
They make them in all colors now.

1406
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:58,817
You're still wearing your hair
the way I like it.

1407
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:00,694
Oh, I've never changed.

1408
01:18:04,114 --> 01:18:06,783
Where do you want these? In the bedroom?

1409
01:18:06,825 --> 01:18:09,285
Well, I certainly don't want them
in the kitchen.

1410
01:18:10,078 --> 01:18:11,454
You heard the lady.

1411
01:18:17,544 --> 01:18:19,087
How long can you stay?

1412
01:18:19,129 --> 01:18:22,298
Depends. The band's
opening at some joint in Atlantic City,

1413
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:25,635
but I told them I had to go
to Cleveland to see a sick relative.

1414
01:18:25,719 --> 01:18:30,140
That's close enough. I am sick
and I am a relative. At least I used to be.

1415
01:18:30,181 --> 01:18:32,225
Harry, promise me something.

1416
01:18:32,308 --> 01:18:35,311
As soon as you get a little money,
have this couch recovered.

1417
01:18:35,395 --> 01:18:36,771
Don't worry. According to Willie,

1418
01:18:36,813 --> 01:18:39,858
I can have it reupholstered in $100 bills.

1419
01:18:39,941 --> 01:18:41,609
I may even get a new apartment.

1420
01:18:41,651 --> 01:18:43,987
I already got a Mustang.
Willie's breaking it in for me.

1421
01:18:44,070 --> 01:18:48,450
Who cares? The important thing
is to get you well again.

Don't know what
I would have done without him.

1427
01:19:05,675 --> 01:19:07,343
Harry, what do the doctors say?

1428
01:19:08,845 --> 01:19:10,054
Well, they're just guessing.

1429
01:19:10,138 --> 01:19:15,351
It's a compressed vertebra
and some nerve damage. It all connects up.

1430
01:19:15,393 --> 01:19:16,686
Compressed vertebra?

1431
01:19:16,728 --> 01:19:19,355
Yeah, but I may fool everybody.

1432
01:19:19,439 --> 01:19:22,358
I may be back on my feet
a lot sooner than anyone expects.

1433
01:19:24,068 --> 01:19:26,237
On the other hand,
you never know about these things.

- The fireplace.
- Oh.

1438
01:19:36,498 --> 01:19:38,333
Be nice to have a fire now.

1439
01:19:39,876 --> 01:19:43,338
Remember when we used
to put a red light bulb behind the logs,

1440
01:19:43,379 --> 01:19:45,256
pretend this was a bearskin rug?

1441

01:19:47,675 --> 01:19:49,052
Shameless.

I think we should have some white wine.

- I didn't get any.
- Look in the wine cellar.

Not that I think she's perfect.

What a terrible mistake I'd made.

You have no idea how many times

1472
01:22:02,018 --> 01:22:04,520
I wanted to pick up that phone and call you,

I didn't stop to think. I just called.

I'm glad you did.
At least something good came out of it.

The day I got the divorce papers, I was
working at some club on Long Island.

Coffee. We'll have it in the library.

01:23:14,841 --> 01:23:16,342
Or would you prefer the east wing terrace?

1496
01:23:16,426 --> 01:23:17,927

Nonsense. You should have heard the way

01:23:33,317 --> 01:23:34,986
he was talking about you in the kitchen.

do you really think you need him anymore?

Well, it's not that I need him. He needs me.

1505
01:23:43,953 --> 01:23:46,622
It makes him feel better to help me out.

1506
01:23:46,706 --> 01:23:49,125
Thought that was going to be my job.

- Oh, honey...
- Don't deny it.

1509
01:23:52,712 --> 01:23:54,964
I guess I was kind of silly and useless,

1510
01:23:55,798 --> 01:23:58,760
but I want a second chance now.

1511
01:23:58,801 --> 01:24:00,595
Maybe I've grown up a little.

So don't snow me. I know it's a fraud.

1688

I wish you wouldn't use words like that.

1689
01:35:34,663 --> 01:35:35,998
And so is the Foundation.

1690
01:35:36,039 --> 01:35:37,791
All right. Let's just say It's a legal maneuver

1691
01:35:37,833 --> 01:35:39,418
to put the squeeze
on the insurance company.

1692
01:35:39,501 --> 01:35:40,878
They can go to court and fight me,

1693
01:35:40,961 --> 01:35:43,338
but they wouldn't dare
fight an organized charity.

1694
01:35:43,881 --> 01:35:47,050
If anybody had told me Harry would
get involved in a thing like this...

1695
01:35:47,134 --> 01:35:48,886
Well, it wasn't easy.
And he may still blow it.

from across the street.

- I get the picture.
- I hope they don't.

1699

I'd appreciate it very much.

- Worry not.

1701

if you can annul a marriage,

1708
01:36:27,424 --> 01:36:29,218

I wouldn't call it cheap.

that money is going to charity,

1731

they'll nail the insurance company

1732

1733
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:39,288

who got Boom Boom into this mess?

You want to know the whole story, hmm?

Darling, don't get gray hair over it.

1855
01:44:39,874 --> 01:44:42,043
I've been lying to you all along.

1856
01:44:43,795 --> 01:44:46,715

how can it hurt to have a little money?

We're so close to it now.
Don't throw it away.

1861

For once in your life, be practical.
Do the smart thing.

1862

1865
01:45:55,617 --> 01:45:57,786
I know you're up there!

How did he know we're up...

1868

I got a message for you
from Gemini Control.

1947
01:49:47,557 --> 01:49:49,350
the big trick is diversification.

You put a little money
into uranium stocks,

1949
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:54,897
a few oil wells in Montana,

1950
01:49:55,273 --> 01:49:57,692
some real estate in downtown Phoenix.

Right now I need it.

2020
01:54:52,570 --> 01:54:53,946
(SOBBING CONTINUES)

2021
01:54:54,864 --> 01:54:56,782
I don't want to find you here
when I get back.

2022
01:54:59,160 --> 01:55:01,162
Take your damn meat loaf with you.

2023
01:55:13,341 --> 01:55:15,426
Nothing wrong with my leg, either.

2024
01:55:19,055 --> 01:55:21,849
How did I ever marry into a family like this?

2025
01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:24,894
Wait a minute, Purkey!

2026
01:55:24,977 --> 01:55:28,189
I'm not through yet!
Keep that camera rolling.

2027
01:55:30,524 --> 01:55:31,817
Go ahead.

2028
01:55:31,859 --> 01:55:33,861
Let's see him wriggle out of this one.

2029
01:55:40,409 --> 01:55:43,663
This is William H. Gingrich, attorney-at-law.

2030
01:55:43,704 --> 01:55:45,873
I am both shocked and dismayed to learn

2031
01:55:45,957 --> 01:55:48,042
that my client has been deceiving me.

2032
01:55:48,125 --> 01:55:50,753
But there is no legal case
against Mr. Hinkle,

2033
01:55:50,836 --> 01:55:53,381
because no money has changed hands.

2034
01:55:54,882 --> 01:55:59,679
However, there is a legal case against
the firm of O'Brien, Thompson, and Kincaid.

2035
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:01,806
They have invaded the privacy of my client,

2036
01:56:01,889 --> 01:56:04,433
which is a violation of
the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution

2037
01:56:04,517 --> 01:56:08,562
and the federal
anti-wiretapping law of 1934.

2038
01:56:09,105 --> 01:56:12,692
I am therefore filing charges
against these gentlemen

2039
01:56:12,733 --> 01:56:14,735
before the Ethical Practices Committee

2040
01:56:14,777 --> 01:56:17,071
of the American Bar Association.

2041
01:56:17,154 --> 01:56:19,991
Furthermore, I am moving immediately

2042
01:56:20,074 --> 01:56:26,497
to revoke the license
of one Chester Purkey, private investigator.

2043
01:56:27,957 --> 01:56:31,585
He has maligned a member
of a minority group,

2044
01:56:31,669 --> 01:56:34,046
and I shall duly report this fact

2045
01:56:34,088 --> 01:56:36,590
to the Civil Rights Division
of the Justice Department,

2046
01:56:36,632 --> 01:56:39,093
the Human Rights Commission
of the United Nations,

2047
01:56:39,176 --> 01:56:43,389
the NAACP, CORE,
the American Civil Liberties Union...

2048
01:56:43,431 --> 01:56:44,432
(CRUNCHING)

2049
01:56:49,103 --> 01:56:50,938
I think I found your contact lens.

2050
01:58:02,510 --> 01:58:03,511
Even.

2051
01:58:12,353 --> 01:58:13,354
Odd.

2052
01:58:14,897 --> 01:58:16,357
This ain't my day.

2053
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:19,610
Yeah?

2054
01:58:19,693 --> 01:58:21,195
Lookin' for Boom Boom Jackson.

2055
01:58:21,237 --> 01:58:24,657
You're 10 minutes late.
He just cleaned out his locker.

2056
01:58:25,533 --> 01:58:28,536
The team fightin' to stay up there,
and this has to happen.

2057
01:58:28,577 --> 01:58:30,663
I would have believed it of some
of the other guys,

2058
01:58:30,704 --> 01:58:32,873
but Jackson in a barroom brawl?

2059
01:58:33,833 --> 01:58:35,584
I don't know what got into him.

2060
01:58:40,047 --> 01:58:41,048
Even.

2061
01:58:43,342 --> 01:58:47,179
Wait a minute. We ain't got no 99.

2062
01:58:50,558 --> 01:58:51,767
(SNAPS FINGERS)

2063
01:59:47,781 --> 01:59:49,158
This seat taken?

2064
01:59:58,959 --> 02:00:00,461
What's that with the matches?

2065
02:00:01,212 --> 02:00:05,341
It's for a buddy of mine, Harry Hinkle.
He's in a wheelchair.

2066
02:00:07,801 --> 02:00:09,011
Remember what you said in the hospital,

2067
02:00:09,094 --> 02:00:11,847
what you'd do to anybody
who called your buddy a faker?

2068
02:00:11,931 --> 02:00:14,350
Well, I say, "Harry Hinkle is a faker."

2069
02:00:16,602 --> 02:00:18,312
What are you waiting for?
Go ahead. Belt me.

2070
02:00:18,979 --> 02:00:20,814
Why did you do it?

2071
02:00:20,898 --> 02:00:22,233
For the money. What else?

2072
02:00:22,983 --> 02:00:24,151
You're a liar.

2073
02:00:24,902 --> 02:00:26,695
That's what I came to tell you.

2074
02:00:26,779 --> 02:00:29,782
If it's for the money,
how come you're out of that chair?

2075
02:00:29,823 --> 02:00:33,452
I didn't like the setup.
I didn't like the characters involved,

2076
02:00:33,494 --> 02:00:34,828
especially me.

2077
02:00:35,829 --> 02:00:37,122
Go ahead. Do it.

2078
02:00:37,164 --> 02:00:38,832
And put you back in that corset?

2079
02:00:38,916 --> 02:00:41,585
Oh, no, I'm not gonna go through that again.

2080
02:00:47,424 --> 02:00:49,677
- I see you're all packed, huh?
- Yeah.

2081
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:52,137
Shaving kit, three pairs of socks,

2082
02:00:52,179 --> 02:00:55,015
and the football they gave me
after the Baltimore game.

2083
02:00:57,434 --> 02:00:59,645
- Where you goin'?
- I don't know.

2084
02:00:59,687 --> 02:01:02,731
But somewhere between
here and there there's got to be a bar.

2085
02:01:02,815 --> 02:01:04,566
Come on. I'll buy you a drink.

2086
02:01:06,360 --> 02:01:08,195
Look, Boom Boom, they'll make you
sit out a couple of games,

2087
02:01:08,237 --> 02:01:10,030
slap you with a big fine, but you'll be back.

2088
02:01:10,531 --> 02:01:13,200
I don't care one way or the other,
because I'm through.

2089
02:01:13,242 --> 02:01:14,410
Who says you're through?

2090
02:01:14,493 --> 02:01:15,869
83,000 people.

2091
02:01:16,370 --> 02:01:18,414
When they boo you
every time you come off the field,

2092
02:01:18,497 --> 02:01:20,040
you begin to get the message.

2093
02:01:20,124 --> 02:01:23,210
Sure you've been playing lousy.
You had this mental block.

2094
02:01:23,252 --> 02:01:24,503
I'm supposed to be a pro.

2095
02:01:24,878 --> 02:01:28,215
Once you start to choke up,
once you drop three punts in a row,

2096
02:01:28,257 --> 02:01:30,301
you better look around
for another line of work.

2097
02:01:30,384 --> 02:01:31,510
Such as what?

2098
02:01:32,303 --> 02:01:34,179
Guy my size, my weight?

2099
02:01:34,221 --> 02:01:36,307
I can always make it in the wrestling racket.

2100
02:01:36,432 --> 02:01:40,394
I think I'd make a pretty good heavy.
Call myself the Dark Angel.

02:01:51,989 --> 02:01:54,283
You sure kept me busy that day,
trying to follow you with the camera.

41 yards, 57 yards...

2106
02:01:55,826 --> 02:01:57,369
So long, buddy.

2107
02:01:57,411 --> 02:01:58,787
See you around.

02:02:14,928 --> 02:02:16,638
You forgot something!

2111
02:02:24,355 --> 02:02:25,606
Catch!

2112
02:02:27,941 --> 02:02:29,735
Go, man, go!

2113
02:02:31,779 --> 02:02:33,781

2114
02:02:34,490 --> 02:02:36,200
Yeah! Ha!

2115
02:02:36,283 --> 02:02:37,493
Gotcha!

02:03:17,574 --> 02:03:19,159
Are you all right, buddy?

2118
02:03:21,161 --> 02:03:22,538
Did I hurt you, buddy?

2119
02:03:23,497 --> 02:03:25,290
Buddy! Talk to me, buddy.

2120
02:03:32,297 --> 02:03:34,299
Why doesn't one of you guys
answer the phone?

2121
02:03:34,341 --> 02:03:35,342
What phone?

2122
02:03:35,426 --> 02:03:36,510
It's ringing.

2123
02:03:37,386 --> 02:03:39,138
There's no phone here.

2124
02:03:40,597 --> 02:03:42,850
Hey, how many of me do you see?

2125
02:03:42,891 --> 02:03:44,268
- Two.
- Two?

2126
02:03:45,352 --> 02:03:49,314
Boom Boom Jackson and some nut
who wants to call himself the Dark Angel.

2127
02:03:57,489 --> 02:03:59,450
Come on. Play ball.

2128
02:03:59,533 --> 02:04:00,826
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2129
02:04:00,868 --> 02:04:02,202
- Give me the ball!
- Okay.

2130
02:04:02,244 --> 02:04:03,287
Come on.

2131
02:04:03,787 --> 02:04:04,830
Let's go!

2132
02:04:04,872 --> 02:04:09,209
Hup one, hup two, hup three,
hup four, hup five, hup ten!

2133
02:04:09,293 --> 02:04:11,086
Hup ten, yeah!
