ANY SIMILARITY TO ACTUAL EVENTS
OR PEOPLE IS COINCIDENTAL

3
00:04:41,116 --> 00:04:42,595
- Sir.
- How much is it?

4
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:44,692
600 francs.

5
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:47,231
Thank you.

6
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,888
- Let's go.
- Why?

7
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:51,956
- Sorry, but Noelle is a bit tired.
- What? Me?

8
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:55,642
- But I'll see you tomorrow. Good night.
- See you tomorrow.

9
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:01,814
I'm tired.

10
00:05:01,928 --> 00:05:05,159
This improvement course
for NATO officials is really hard.

11
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:06,576
You do nothing all day.

12
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:09,560
That's what you think.
We don't do anything, it's true.

13
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:13,640
In fact it's three in the morning and
I have to go straight to headquarters.

14
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:15,812
- At three in the morning?
- Yes, dear.

15
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,740
We're on the alert over Yemen.

16
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:21,940
The northern guerrillas
set fire to a village in the south.

17
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:25,072
- You're being a fireman?
- That provincial wit of yours.

18
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:28,200
It's my mistake telling you things
you can't understand.

19
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,883
Good night, dear. Sleep well.

20
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:34,069
Don't forget to set your alarm for ten
because the plane leaves at 12:45.

21
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,599
NATO headquarters, Versailles.

22
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,209
- Stop here.
- Here?

23
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,255
Didn't you say NATO headquarters?

24
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,428
- Yes, but I changed my mind. How much?
- 15.

25
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,388
Thank you.

26
00:07:20,312 --> 00:07:21,506
Who's there?

27
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:31,603
Who's there?

28
00:07:35,076 --> 00:07:38,068
Look out, I've got a gun. Who's there?

29
00:07:38,245 --> 00:07:40,634
No, it's me, darling. It's Andrea.

30
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:43,907
- Are you crazy?
- My darling.

31
00:07:44,085 --> 00:07:47,760
Don't you know that you nearly
killed me? I love it! It's so beautiful!

32
00:07:47,964 --> 00:07:50,194
- What do you mean, beautiful?
- Darling...

33
00:07:50,341 --> 00:07:54,698
You're shaking all over. You were scared.
I was scared too, so scared.

34
00:07:54,928 --> 00:07:58,603
- But I love it, I love it.
- I've had enough of these jokes.

35
00:07:58,807 --> 00:08:01,196
Why, precious?
We have fun. It's beautiful.

36
00:08:01,351 --> 00:08:03,342
You know that...

37
00:08:04,771 --> 00:08:08,924
Major! What's going on?
Who shot you?

38
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:11,028
- Major!
- It's the concierge.

39
00:08:11,153 --> 00:08:12,711
Open up. Police.

40
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:16,416
A shot was fired by accident.
It's easy to say.

41
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:19,449
But we can't just issue a warning, Major.

42
00:08:21,996 --> 00:08:25,227
Could I speak to you man-to-man?

43
00:08:30,296 --> 00:08:33,414
I'm used to this kind of proposition.
Talk to me.

44
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:37,140
Well, I'd like to appeal
to your experience as a man

45
00:08:37,345 --> 00:08:39,779
and above all as a Frenchman,
Superintendent.

46
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:44,163
The person in question has a very
passionate and jealous temperament.

47
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:45,792
What are you telling him?

48
00:08:45,894 --> 00:08:50,729
We're trying to get you
out of this mess, darling. Keep calm.

49
00:08:54,444 --> 00:08:57,243
As I was saying,
she has a very fiery temperament.

50
00:08:57,406 --> 00:09:00,045
- She's from the south.
- Your wife's Italian?

51
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,077
Corsican.

52
00:09:03,578 --> 00:09:07,412
She's not my wife.
Partly because of this, you see.

53
00:09:07,624 --> 00:09:11,139
I've been meaning to marry her
for three years.

54
00:09:11,336 --> 00:09:14,772
There was another scene. She picked up
my gun but nothing happened.

55
00:09:14,964 --> 00:09:19,116
I think she only did it to frighten me.

56
00:09:19,343 --> 00:09:23,576
On the other hand,
jealousy is a guarantee of love.

57
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:27,052
- Would you like a lozenge?
- Thanks.

58
00:09:27,185 --> 00:09:28,254
There you are.

59
00:09:28,352 --> 00:09:30,946
- You have great understanding.
- Thank you.

60
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,500
This time we'll turn a blind eye, madam.

61
00:09:35,651 --> 00:09:38,848
But I must tell you
to consider yourself cautioned.

62
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:40,064
- Cautioned?
- Yes.

63
00:09:40,155 --> 00:09:43,670
And try to control your rash actions.
In fact, leave them in Corsica.

64
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:46,701
- A bit of goodwill, madam...
- My rash actions?

65
00:09:46,871 --> 00:09:49,510
Just a bit of goodwill, madam.

66
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:52,498
He's been very kind.
I'll explain everything.

67
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:01,901
Come on. I said sorry.
I made a mistake. I won't do it again.

68
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:06,094
It's funny. The superintendent believed
that you're a passionate woman.

69
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,740
I thought you liked my joke last night.

70
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:12,601
Joke? Like that time when you drove
a kilometre on the wrong side of the road.

71
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:16,009
I'd just come from England
and I was used to driving on the left.

72
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,899
- They're little love games.
- Games? They're serious.

73
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:23,308
Without those little games
you're no good at anything.

74
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,604
You're worse than a wife.

75
00:10:24,698 --> 00:10:28,373
Get yourself seen to,
you ugly impotent man.

76
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:31,216
- What?
- Impotent.

77
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:34,808
DR FRANCESCO CAPASSO
PROFESSOR AT NAPLES UNIVERSITY

78
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,912
PSYCHOANALYST'S SURGERY

79
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,121
Thank you.

80
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:27,943
Professor,
I'm in a very embarrassing situation.

81
00:11:28,969 --> 00:11:30,322
You're impotent?

82
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:33,375
Can you tell?

83
00:11:35,225 --> 00:11:40,583
No, but it's quite a normal condition.

84
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:54,161
- Should I lie down?
- If you prefer.

85
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:56,347
I thought you had to.

86
00:11:56,454 --> 00:12:00,766
Not in the first session, but if it makes you
feel more at ease, go ahead.

87
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,436
- Yes, I'd rather.
- Make yourself comfortable.

88
00:12:07,381 --> 00:12:09,372
There.

89
00:12:21,562 --> 00:12:24,599
Have you noticed that drawing?
It looks like a spider.

90
00:12:24,773 --> 00:12:28,766
- You think it looks like a spider?
- Why? Does it have a meaning?

91
00:12:28,985 --> 00:12:32,102
- Of course, but go on.
- What's the meaning?

92
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,920
- It's too early.
- All right, but good or bad?

93
00:12:35,075 --> 00:12:37,543
I'm telling you it's too early. Go on.

94
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:48,245
Now try to explain clearly to me
how you formed your conviction.

95
00:12:49,464 --> 00:12:52,934
The first signs were the words
of an ex-girlfriend from Paris.

96
00:12:53,134 --> 00:12:54,806
She was upset because I'd left her.

97
00:12:54,927 --> 00:12:58,716
I wanted to disprove her and prove to myself
that everything was working.

98
00:12:58,932 --> 00:13:01,605
The opportunity arose
on the flight back.

99
00:13:06,647 --> 00:13:14,565
Ladies and gentlemen, please
fasten your safety belts. Thank you.

100
00:13:21,286 --> 00:13:24,006
Sir. Please.

101
00:13:27,793 --> 00:13:31,832
Excuse me, madam.
I've got a problem with this arm.

102
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:35,357
Could you help me? Thank you.

103
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:46,849
No, stay a little bit longer.
Landing, you know...

104
00:13:50,607 --> 00:13:53,963
- Are you afraid?
- You're never afraid?

105
00:13:54,151 --> 00:13:56,585
Yes, sometimes.

106
00:13:56,737 --> 00:14:00,366
Will you let me hold your hand?
We can help each other be brave.

107
00:14:05,787 --> 00:14:08,381
Where will you be tonight?

108
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:14,998
In Naples between Flights 319 and 420.

109
00:14:15,214 --> 00:14:17,523
In Cairo between Flights 58 and...

110
00:14:17,674 --> 00:14:19,983
What are you going to do in Naples?

111
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:25,406
- I don't know.
- I know.

112
00:14:26,683 --> 00:14:29,516
I've only got two hours and 45 minutes.

113
00:14:29,685 --> 00:14:31,835
I'll make it last a century.

114
00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:37,100
It's an ordinary place but how could anybody
say it's not a wonderful view?

115
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,433
You'll see what a sunset really is, darling.
Such an enchanting sight.

116
00:14:41,656 --> 00:14:44,807
I won't see the sunset.
The plane will already have left.

117
00:14:44,992 --> 00:14:47,825
Of course. How stupid of me.

118
00:14:47,995 --> 00:14:50,907
What number do I call
to find out the exact time?

119
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:52,639
The exact time? 16.

120
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:56,185
Can you pass me my watch, please?
It's in my handbag.

121
00:14:56,378 --> 00:14:58,733
Of course.

122
00:15:02,092 --> 00:15:05,528
Who knows if it'll be the exact time
here in Naples? Thank you.

123
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:07,916
I think it will be.

124
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:13,247
91 minutes have passed already.

125
00:15:13,436 --> 00:15:15,392
Company issue.

126
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:19,917
We've got an hour and 13 minutes left.

127
00:15:21,652 --> 00:15:23,244
Come on. Quick.

128
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:26,272
Yes. Come on. Sorry.

129
00:15:29,702 --> 00:15:31,055
Beautiful.

130
00:15:31,162 --> 00:15:34,313
I'll get the porter to call me as well,
to be on the safe side.

131
00:15:54,810 --> 00:16:00,442
Reception? Can you call Room 419
in 38 minutes' time? Thank you.

132
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:22,326
Andrea, it's 3:53pm. Hurry up.

133
00:16:42,648 --> 00:16:44,878
Here I am.

134
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:48,654
Let's order some champagne.
Aren't you thirsty? Would you like some?

135
00:16:48,862 --> 00:16:52,252
Champagne at this time of day?
It's almost time for tea.

136
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:54,440
Let's not, then.

137
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,046
You're as light as a feather.

138
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,011
Oops-a-daisy.

139
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:33,600
It's like unwrapping a fine chocolate.

140
00:17:52,883 --> 00:17:57,240
Excuse me, darling, but how long is it?

141
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,780
- Eight feet and nine inches.
- Right.

142
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:05,273
Beautiful,

143
00:18:05,394 --> 00:18:07,146
divine,

144
00:18:07,271 --> 00:18:09,421
stupendous,

145
00:18:09,565 --> 00:18:12,398
fantastic creature of the Orient.

146
00:18:38,301 --> 00:18:41,772
How do you say "love" in your country?

147
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:47,622
It sounds like a Chinese minister.

148
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:52,349
What on earth...
You can't get five minutes' peace here.

149
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:56,948
I'll go and see what they want.

150
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:07,713
- You rang...
- A telegram for me?

151
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,264
Thank you, you're very kind.
This is for you.

152
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,407
But...

153
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:21,935
A telegram for me? What's happened?

154
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,713
"Grandpa died suddenly. Stop.

155
00:19:35,857 --> 00:19:38,291
"Join us immediately, Dad. Stop."

156
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:45,484
My grandfather.

157
00:19:45,616 --> 00:19:47,493
He's dead.

158
00:19:48,452 --> 00:19:50,443
He was 87.

159
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,617
It was to be expected.

160
00:19:58,379 --> 00:20:01,974
87 years are 87 years.

161
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,816
But it's strange.
I'd never have thought that I'd lose him.

162
00:20:08,055 --> 00:20:12,173
- Is your grandfather alive or dead?
- My grandfather's in excellent health.

163
00:20:12,392 --> 00:20:14,986
- Excellent health?
- Yes. You didn't understand.

164
00:20:15,145 --> 00:20:17,899
- You killed him cynically.
- No, it was all...

165
00:20:18,065 --> 00:20:19,134
Carry on.

166
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:23,226
I want to weep for you, Grandpa,
but I'm a man and I can't.

167
00:20:24,988 --> 00:20:28,378
It's true, darling.
A man must be a man.

168
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:32,045
Definitely. A man must be a man.

169
00:20:39,668 --> 00:20:44,265
But... I am a man.

170
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:50,638
Bye.

171
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:59,704
Oh, my goodness.
I've made a real fool of myself.

172
00:20:59,938 --> 00:21:04,694
A real fool of myself.
Oh, my goodness.

173
00:21:06,153 --> 00:21:08,383
I've made a real fool of myself.

174
00:21:33,263 --> 00:21:36,096
- Sir...
- Come in, sweetheart.

175
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:38,461
Don't be afraid. Come in.

176
00:21:43,355 --> 00:21:46,028
I called you
because I wanted to say sorry.

177
00:21:46,191 --> 00:21:47,704
I'm sorry.

178
00:21:47,818 --> 00:21:51,333
I had to get rid
of that boring woman somehow.

179
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,088
Yes, sir.

180
00:21:53,198 --> 00:21:56,271
Wait. Thank goodness she's gone.

181
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,866
And you?

182
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:03,591
What about me?

183
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:06,143
What are you doing this evening?

184
00:22:06,294 --> 00:22:08,410
Don't you want to tell me?

185
00:22:08,546 --> 00:22:12,061
Of course you want to tell me.
Are you embarrassed?

186
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:17,108
- I finish at eight.
- Yeah?

187
00:22:17,263 --> 00:22:19,414
And you're free until when?

188
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:22,981
Until eight tomorrow evening.

189
00:22:52,965 --> 00:22:59,518
Let's hold each other like this,
heart and soul

190
00:23:01,306 --> 00:23:09,260
Never leave each other again,
not even for an hour

191
00:23:11,149 --> 00:23:17,941
This desire for you scares me

192
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:26,791
To live with you, only with you,
so I won't die

193
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:31,120
Why do we say...

194
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:59,102
I sing love

195
00:23:59,363 --> 00:24:02,878
Do you understand or not?

196
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:05,065
I sang all night long

197
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:08,830
Both my classical
and my modern repertoire. Even Catarì.

198
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:13,554
I made up lots of the lyrics
because I'm not a singer.

199
00:24:14,752 --> 00:24:17,505
The girl fell asleep just before dawn.

200
00:24:17,671 --> 00:24:22,826
Without making a sound I pulled the boat
to the shore and escaped.

201
00:24:26,889 --> 00:24:30,165
When that woman said that in Paris...
I think it's about suggestion.

202
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:33,104
Stop. Leave the diagnosis to me,
my friend.

203
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,545
Yes.

204
00:24:35,689 --> 00:24:37,327
- Water.
- Fire.

205
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:38,635
- White.
- Black.

206
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:40,166
Tree.

207
00:24:40,276 --> 00:24:44,316
You have to reply immediately,
otherwise the test is pointless.

208
00:24:44,531 --> 00:24:46,169
- Pepper.
- Pipe. Pap.

209
00:24:46,283 --> 00:24:49,195
No, sorry, that's not it.
My head's all over the place.

210
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:52,088
Tell me what's happening
and if there's a cure.

211
00:24:52,247 --> 00:24:54,715
I can't sleep, I've lost weight.
72 kilos.

212
00:24:54,874 --> 00:24:57,627
Calm down. It was salt.

213
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,938
- What does this make you think of?
- It's a spider.

214
00:25:14,101 --> 00:25:16,535
- Again?
- Why, isn't that right?

215
00:25:16,687 --> 00:25:20,475
- You always think of spiders.
- Sorry, but you drew a spider.

216
00:25:20,691 --> 00:25:22,602
- OK, that's enough.
- Listen...

217
00:25:22,734 --> 00:25:25,487
No, don't worry. The test is finished.

218
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:28,088
- We'll sum things up later.
- Later?

219
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,470
Can't you give me some idea?

220
00:25:31,951 --> 00:25:34,671
- Recurring dreams?
- Recurring dreams.

221
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,583
Lie down. Stay lying down.

222
00:25:37,749 --> 00:25:40,309
- Do you have the same dreams?
- Yes.

223
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,930
I often dream about being a trapeze artist
like the ones in the circus.

224
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:47,281
I jump from one trapeze to another
and often fall down.

225
00:25:47,467 --> 00:25:49,776
- It's natural.
- Natural? What does it mean?

226
00:25:49,927 --> 00:25:51,485
- Silence.
- Grave.

227
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:55,410
I said "silence" to you.
Have the courtesy to be quiet.

228
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:57,795
Lie down. Stay lying down.

229
00:26:01,606 --> 00:26:04,678
- Shall we talk about women?
- If you like.

230
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:07,214
Well, then, talk about them.

231
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:10,000
I've always liked women, Professor.

232
00:26:10,155 --> 00:26:12,544
I've always been a more-than-normal man.

233
00:26:12,699 --> 00:26:15,293
- I could give you an example.
- Go on.

234
00:26:15,452 --> 00:26:18,205
When I was a boy
I used to walk on stilts...

235
00:26:18,371 --> 00:26:20,487
- I said women.
- Exactly.

236
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:23,700
Once I made myself a pair

237
00:26:23,836 --> 00:26:27,351
so that I could watch the cobbler's wife,
whom I fancied like mad.

238
00:26:27,548 --> 00:26:31,939
In small towns the bedrooms are
usually on the first floor, and so...

239
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,751
I could tell you
about lots more occasions like this one.

240
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:13,838
Professor?

241
00:27:13,968 --> 00:27:15,526
Professor?

242
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:19,106
Professor! Tell me honestly
what you think about me.

243
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:22,696
I'm a soldier
and nothing can frighten me.

244
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:25,009
What's happening?
What are you doing?

245
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:28,376
Over there.
Look carefully in front of you.

246
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:38,796
Bisons fight each other, often until
one of them dies, over a female.

247
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:48,453
The most terrifying living being,
the praying mantis.

248
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:53,100
During intercourse
the female eats the male.

249
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:59,460
The male knows he will be eaten
but he doesn't try to escape his fate.

250
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,669
Indeed, he holds back so that
the climax of his amorous ecstasy

251
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:07,812
coincides precisely with his death.

252
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:16,114
Professor, can we turn the light on?

253
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,332
You have certainly told me
some disturbing things,

254
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,572
but I want to know about my condition...

255
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:36,828
- Don't worry.
- I'm not worried.

256
00:28:36,964 --> 00:28:41,037
But I am protesting. Can't you believe
that I've always been a normal man?

257
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,296
Professor, I'm desperate.

258
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:48,060
Can't you put something hard and cold
on my temple and press your finger...

259
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,300
Stop.

260
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:54,634
Instead of the word "revolver"
you used a complicated phrase.

261
00:28:54,857 --> 00:28:56,176
- Really?
- Yes.

262
00:28:56,275 --> 00:29:00,188
Professor, tell me what all these spiders,
bisons and mantises mean.

263
00:29:00,404 --> 00:29:01,917
OK, I'll explain.

264
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:05,340
In nature, love is reached
through risk and conquest.

265
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:07,888
It's evident
in all your amorous adventures

266
00:29:08,036 --> 00:29:10,630
that in order to conquer a woman
and love her

267
00:29:10,788 --> 00:29:13,542
you have always needed
the stimulus of danger.

268
00:29:13,709 --> 00:29:15,700
Isn't that the case?

269
00:29:18,421 --> 00:29:21,493
Now that you mention it,
that may really be the case.

270
00:29:23,468 --> 00:29:25,299
Behave.

271
00:29:27,805 --> 00:29:30,638
Keep still. Keep still.

272
00:29:33,227 --> 00:29:35,423
Beautiful, Frieda.

273
00:29:51,495 --> 00:29:53,486
This way, ladies and gentlemen.

274
00:29:53,622 --> 00:29:56,932
Here's the bedroom,
the last room in the private apartments.

275
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:59,400
It's better like this.

276
00:29:59,545 --> 00:30:01,900
Wait.

277
00:30:02,047 --> 00:30:03,765
It's better like this, Frieda.

278
00:30:03,882 --> 00:30:06,840
<i>...a unique example of inestimable worth,</i>

279
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:09,604
second only
to the great bed of Versailles.

280
00:30:09,763 --> 00:30:13,722
From a historical point of view too,
it is a very important antique

281
00:30:13,933 --> 00:30:18,723
because it is found
in the archives of the palace...

282
00:30:19,688 --> 00:30:23,397
There. What do you say, Professor?
Is there hope?

283
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:26,267
No.

284
00:30:28,197 --> 00:30:30,188
No, you're not impotent.

285
00:30:32,118 --> 00:30:36,191
There. That's the best news I've had
in my whole life. Thank you...

286
00:30:36,413 --> 00:30:38,369
I don't know if it's that good.

287
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:44,952
- Do you have relatives?
- Yes, I have a sister.

288
00:30:45,171 --> 00:30:49,085
But I don't want to go and talk to her
about these things. It's not right.

289
00:30:49,301 --> 00:30:51,417
What is it that's so serious, Professor?

290
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:54,852
You are victim
to serious sexual degeneration.

291
00:30:55,724 --> 00:30:58,875
- Me?
- It gets worse day by day.

292
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:03,497
Without the stimulus of danger
you no longer have any libido.

293
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:07,489
- I no longer have any...
- Libido.

294
00:31:07,652 --> 00:31:10,803
Lustful desire, amorous stimulus.

295
00:31:10,988 --> 00:31:15,426
The necessity to make love in dangerous
situations will become more pressing.

296
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,015
The primordial demon will enthral you

297
00:31:18,162 --> 00:31:20,835
and the women who come to you
will risk their lives.

298
00:31:20,998 --> 00:31:22,829
You are in serious danger too.

299
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:25,711
You could end up in jail
or even a psychiatric prison.

300
00:31:25,878 --> 00:31:26,947
My goodness.

301
00:31:27,046 --> 00:31:29,560
I'm sorry to be so explicit,

302
00:31:29,715 --> 00:31:33,151
but I'm not in the habit
of deluding patients.

303
00:31:33,343 --> 00:31:35,538
Can't anything be done, then?

304
00:31:36,847 --> 00:31:40,635
Yes, of course.
First and foremost, give up women.

305
00:31:40,851 --> 00:31:43,729
Look only for other kinds of pleasure
from a woman.

306
00:31:43,896 --> 00:31:46,251
Exclusively platonic
and spiritual kinds.

307
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:48,787
Like the chaste marriage
of St Pamacchio and St Paulina.

308
00:31:49,818 --> 00:31:50,967
Who?

309
00:31:51,069 --> 00:31:53,788
- Are you Catholic?
- Yes, like everybody else.

310
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:56,744
Well, you can always hope for a miracle.

311
00:31:56,908 --> 00:31:59,103
And I don't rule out that over time

312
00:31:59,243 --> 00:32:03,317
a normal, acceptable desire
will come back to arouse your senses.

313
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:07,772
But the other bestial desire,
don't ever follow it.

314
00:32:08,002 --> 00:32:10,721
You are a man, not a bison.

315
00:32:11,631 --> 00:32:16,659
Learn to analyse your feelings
and keep your senses under control.

316
00:32:17,386 --> 00:32:22,016
Speaking of which, keep a secret diary
and write in it every day.

317
00:32:22,265 --> 00:32:24,904
Then come and see me
and we'll have another chat.

318
00:32:25,895 --> 00:32:28,011
Come on, don't be disheartened.

319
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:30,217
If you knew how many cases I deal with.

320
00:32:30,357 --> 00:32:34,987
Everybody has a weakness, a vice,
a degenerative tendency.

321
00:32:36,405 --> 00:32:38,361
I too have a weakness.

322
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,958
A passion for black fishnet stockings.

323
00:32:42,076 --> 00:32:46,672
Come on, Professor, everybody likes
girls in black fishnet stockings. I do too.

324
00:32:47,957 --> 00:32:50,552
I'm the one
who wears fishnet stockings.

325
00:32:56,466 --> 00:32:59,663
Well, I'll say goodbye, Professor.

326
00:33:09,728 --> 00:33:14,757
March 23. I've been in Cervinia
for a week, at Pensione Bellevue.

327
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:17,938
I got time off work
because of nervous exhaustion.

328
00:33:18,112 --> 00:33:22,390
I hope to find a new balance
and spiritual interests.

329
00:33:22,616 --> 00:33:24,368
The demon will not have me.

330
00:33:25,744 --> 00:33:29,703
March 26.
Today I met a supernatural being.

331
00:33:29,914 --> 00:33:33,350
Name, Gigliola.
Young upper-class lady from Puglia.

332
00:33:33,543 --> 00:33:35,340
Face, an opal.

333
00:33:36,003 --> 00:33:38,279
Eyes, two grapes.

334
00:33:38,423 --> 00:33:40,539
Body, well made.

335
00:33:41,134 --> 00:33:44,012
Only child. Wanted to become a nun.

336
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:47,808
Her wishes were impeded by her parents
who didn't want to lose her.

337
00:33:48,016 --> 00:33:50,484
The girl respects her parents' wishes

338
00:33:50,643 --> 00:33:54,033
but has taken a vow of chastity
and dresses in white.

339
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:57,506
Her father,
solicitor in Altamura, near Bari.

340
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:02,724
Uncle Monsignor, a glutton.

341
00:34:03,698 --> 00:34:05,768
Her mother, well-mannered.

342
00:34:05,908 --> 00:34:07,899
March 29.

343
00:34:09,537 --> 00:34:11,926
Today, a family excursion.

344
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:16,226
March 31. Alone in the woods at last.

345
00:34:16,877 --> 00:34:18,993
Gigliola talks to me about her vow.

346
00:34:19,129 --> 00:34:22,519
I told her
that I'm about to take one too.

347
00:34:22,715 --> 00:34:24,945
Spoke about spiritual horizons.

348
00:34:25,093 --> 00:34:28,689
Works quoted: Goethe, Elective Affinities,

349
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:31,278
The Life Of St Pamacchio and St Paulina.

350
00:34:31,433 --> 00:34:34,470
April 4. Today we go skating.

351
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:44,862
Even Uncle Monsignor got some exercise.

352
00:34:45,029 --> 00:34:49,466
April 6. Festival of St Rosamund
of the Snow this evening.

353
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,657
Revealed my feelings to Gigliola.

354
00:34:51,786 --> 00:34:55,381
Told her she is indispensable to me.
Proposed marriage.

355
00:34:55,581 --> 00:34:57,458
Her unexpected swoon.

356
00:34:57,583 --> 00:34:59,175
Returned her to her family,

357
00:34:59,293 --> 00:35:01,727
to whom I revealed
my feelings for Gigliola

358
00:35:01,879 --> 00:35:04,268
and my admiration
for Puglia and its people.

359
00:35:04,423 --> 00:35:07,699
April 8. I feel calm, serene.

360
00:35:07,884 --> 00:35:11,957
The Royal Circus has arrived.
Bought tickets for everybody.

361
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:25,808
They scared him.

362
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,661
He's very good.

363
00:35:48,174 --> 00:35:50,165
Greetings, friends.

364
00:36:01,436 --> 00:36:02,915
Pedro.

365
00:36:28,588 --> 00:36:30,579
Bravo!

366
00:36:34,343 --> 00:36:38,495
Here's Trude, our intrepid lion tamer.

367
00:36:49,232 --> 00:36:51,700
Go to your place. Up you go.

368
00:36:52,694 --> 00:36:55,926
Come on. Come on.

369
00:36:56,115 --> 00:36:59,664
Up! Up you go!

370
00:36:59,868 --> 00:37:02,826
Good boy, Sultan.

371
00:37:02,996 --> 00:37:04,907
Up! Up you go!

372
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,344
Good boy, Simba.

373
00:37:10,503 --> 00:37:14,337
Good boy. Come on.

374
00:37:15,382 --> 00:37:17,692
A round of applause for Trude.

375
00:37:22,765 --> 00:37:25,404
Your attention, please.

376
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,269
If there's a brave young man
in the audience

377
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,756
who would like give Trude
a kiss on the cheek,

378
00:37:32,941 --> 00:37:36,775
he can do it, but he must come
into the lions' cage.

379
00:37:38,864 --> 00:37:41,743
Isn't anybody
going to accept the invitation?

380
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:45,026
Doesn't anybody
want to feel this thrill?

381
00:37:45,204 --> 00:37:47,593
Come on! Be brave, boys!

382
00:37:47,748 --> 00:37:49,978
Trude's here waiting.

383
00:37:52,085 --> 00:37:54,474
Come on! Don't be afraid!

384
00:37:55,797 --> 00:37:57,708
Nobody?

385
00:37:57,841 --> 00:38:01,277
Ah, here's somebody.
Very good, young man. Come on in.

386
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:03,460
Open up the cage.

387
00:38:05,014 --> 00:38:06,767
There, that's right.

388
00:38:06,892 --> 00:38:08,405
What's he doing now?

389
00:38:08,518 --> 00:38:10,986
Come on, young man. Don't be afraid.

390
00:38:23,615 --> 00:38:25,685
That's good.

391
00:38:27,035 --> 00:38:29,026
Stay there.

392
00:38:49,682 --> 00:38:51,081
Outrageous behaviour.

393
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,622
April 9.

394
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,732
Fled like a thief in the night
without saying goodbye.

395
00:39:09,493 --> 00:39:11,768
Professor's prediction came true.

396
00:39:11,912 --> 00:39:13,903
Demon unleashed within me.

397
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:16,473
I must resist... But why?

398
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:18,582
Decide to cross the Rubicon at once.

399
00:39:18,711 --> 00:39:20,781
General's wife my first target.

400
00:39:33,225 --> 00:39:34,704
No. That's enough.

401
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:36,925
Aren't you on duty at seven?

402
00:39:37,061 --> 00:39:39,052
They can wait.

403
00:39:45,821 --> 00:39:48,051
- Dolly!
- My husband.

404
00:39:48,198 --> 00:39:50,666
He went to Ischia to have a mud bath.

405
00:39:50,825 --> 00:39:52,736
- Maybe somebody told him.
- No. Who?

406
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:54,746
- Dolly, where are you?
- One minute.

407
00:39:54,871 --> 00:39:58,546
- Who could have told him?
- I don't know. Only a madman.

408
00:39:58,749 --> 00:40:00,740
- A madman?
- What are you doing, Dolly?

409
00:40:00,876 --> 00:40:04,073
- Hurry up.
- Yes, OK. God, this is so exciting.

410
00:40:04,254 --> 00:40:06,768
Open the door.

411
00:40:06,923 --> 00:40:08,880
Dolly!

412
00:40:11,554 --> 00:40:15,547
- How are you, Dolly? What happened?
- Nothing, darling. I've had a shower.

413
00:40:15,766 --> 00:40:19,645
I was in the bathroom.
What happened to you? I'm fine.

414
00:40:19,853 --> 00:40:23,323
Thank goodness. What's this telegram?

415
00:40:23,523 --> 00:40:26,162
Telegram?

416
00:40:26,317 --> 00:40:28,148
No, Lester, wait.

417
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:32,522
Nothing.

418
00:40:39,664 --> 00:40:43,782
"I feel really ill. Come back at once.
Kisses, Dolly."

419
00:40:44,002 --> 00:40:46,755
- You sent it, didn't you?
- No. I don't understand.

420
00:40:46,921 --> 00:40:49,799
Maybe it's a joke.
Or somebody got the address wrong.

421
00:40:49,965 --> 00:40:55,119
Maybe. Nothing works
in this damn country. It's disgusting.

422
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:03,863
May 20. General sent me to Sicily
with a morbid task,

423
00:41:04,105 --> 00:41:06,619
to pick up the corpse
of an old Turkish colonel

424
00:41:06,774 --> 00:41:11,404
who died from sunstroke
while on manoeuvres in the Bosphorus.

425
00:41:11,653 --> 00:41:13,644
Quick march.

426
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:20,067
Stop! Halt!

427
00:41:21,163 --> 00:41:23,154
There they are.

428
00:41:26,168 --> 00:41:28,159
Keep moving!

429
00:41:30,797 --> 00:41:32,788
Come on!

430
00:41:38,179 --> 00:41:41,728
Fall in, quickly. Lay the wreath down.

431
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:43,843
Present arms.

432
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:08,538
Excuse me, Major,
but you've got the wrong coffin.

433
00:42:08,708 --> 00:42:10,062
- Is it possible?
- Yes.

434
00:42:10,169 --> 00:42:14,606
The Colonel's, which I had the honour
to escort, is over there. Can you see?

435
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:18,071
- So who's this?
- I wouldn't know. A civilian.

436
00:42:20,095 --> 00:42:22,006
Pick up the wreath.

437
00:42:22,138 --> 00:42:24,174
Quick march with the wreath.

438
00:42:24,307 --> 00:42:26,537
Present arms.

439
00:42:26,684 --> 00:42:30,359
Left turn.

440
00:42:30,563 --> 00:42:32,554
Quick march.

441
00:42:43,117 --> 00:42:44,835
Can I do anything for you, madam?

442
00:42:44,952 --> 00:42:47,182
Please help me, sir.

443
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:50,002
Time is pressing
and I have to keep going.

444
00:43:06,098 --> 00:43:09,773
Major Rossi-Colombotti,
liaison officer, Third NATO District.

445
00:43:11,227 --> 00:43:14,105
You were at the airport just now.

446
00:43:14,272 --> 00:43:18,504
Yes, I was. I was bidding a final farewell
to somebody very dear to me.

447
00:43:18,734 --> 00:43:22,364
Excuse me, madam,
are you Swedish, Dutch...

448
00:43:22,572 --> 00:43:25,405
Slavic. But this is my country now.

449
00:43:25,575 --> 00:43:28,567
Right. Your Italian is...
I don't know how to say it...

450
00:43:28,745 --> 00:43:32,738
Bad accent? My teacher always
used to say that it was excellent.

451
00:43:32,957 --> 00:43:33,946
Indeed.

452
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:36,509
I was always in demand
for Italian repertoires.

453
00:43:36,669 --> 00:43:39,627
- Opera singer?
- Once upon a time.

454
00:43:39,797 --> 00:43:41,389
Now I get it.

455
00:43:41,506 --> 00:43:45,135
You speak a very refined Italian,
like an opera libretto.

456
00:43:45,343 --> 00:43:48,461
It's a very charming way of speaking.

457
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:51,711
- Do you live in Catania?
- No, in Vicenza.

458
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:58,122
We're guests here in the manor house
of the Princes Silicastros di To.

459
00:43:58,899 --> 00:43:59,888
"We?"

460
00:44:08,699 --> 00:44:11,055
Please drive faster. Put your foot down.

461
00:44:11,203 --> 00:44:13,159
Aren't you afraid on these roads?

462
00:44:13,288 --> 00:44:15,324
- I'm used to it.
- To speed?

463
00:44:17,917 --> 00:44:19,908
To fear.

464
00:44:31,346 --> 00:44:33,462
Who was the person who was dear to you?

465
00:44:35,434 --> 00:44:37,629
My brother.

466
00:44:40,064 --> 00:44:41,941
Heavens! Why are you stopping?

467
00:44:42,066 --> 00:44:44,341
The truth is
that I'm not moving from here.

468
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:49,982
- You're not a gentleman.
- All right.

469
00:44:53,201 --> 00:44:55,715
Very well, then.
He was the man that I loved.

470
00:44:58,664 --> 00:45:00,656
I'm sorry.

471
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,598
How did he die?

472
00:45:05,713 --> 00:45:08,022
A fatal hunting accident.

473
00:45:08,174 --> 00:45:10,688
A gun went off in his hands.

474
00:45:10,843 --> 00:45:14,518
How's that possible?
To go off just like that, for no reason?

475
00:45:16,307 --> 00:45:18,298
Please.

476
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,431
Turn right.

477
00:45:33,157 --> 00:45:34,510
There's the manor house.

478
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,651
- Stop outside.
- Yes.

479
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:47,785
Thank you. Goodbye.

480
00:45:54,761 --> 00:45:58,436
Listen, madam...
At least give me a kiss.

481
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,631
Leave me alone.

482
00:46:01,476 --> 00:46:03,467
My husband!

483
00:46:10,609 --> 00:46:12,885
I pray to God that he hasn't noticed us.

484
00:46:17,867 --> 00:46:19,858
Is he that jealous?

485
00:46:21,453 --> 00:46:25,526
The gun that killed my lover
was given to him by my husband.

486
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:27,102
He blocked the barrel!

487
00:46:27,209 --> 00:46:31,327
Maybe. Look at the risk he had to take.

488
00:46:40,472 --> 00:46:41,541
Goodbye forever.

489
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,995
- No. When can we see each other again?
- Never.

490
00:46:44,142 --> 00:46:47,293
There's a track about a hundred metres
from Capo d'Orlando.

491
00:46:47,478 --> 00:46:50,197
At the end of the track, on the left,
there's a trattoria.

492
00:46:50,356 --> 00:46:53,712
I'll wait for you there tomorrow at two.
It's a very quiet place.

493
00:46:53,901 --> 00:46:55,220
- I can't come.
- You can.

494
00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:57,514
- You'll come.
- No.

495
00:47:19,426 --> 00:47:22,498
She didn't come.
And it wasn't a quiet place.

496
00:47:36,234 --> 00:47:38,225
Is anybody there?

497
00:47:41,364 --> 00:47:43,639
Who is it?

498
00:47:43,783 --> 00:47:46,377
- I'd like to eat. I'm on my own.
- What?

499
00:47:47,244 --> 00:47:49,839
- I don't know. Something light.
- Light?

500
00:47:49,998 --> 00:47:51,989
Yes, something light.

501
00:48:34,332 --> 00:48:38,008
Get him!

502
00:48:40,547 --> 00:48:43,823
Peppino, get a move on! Peppino!

503
00:48:45,218 --> 00:48:49,006
- Get hold of him.
- Leave me alone!

504
00:48:49,221 --> 00:48:53,658
I'm not going to marry her because
she's not a virgin. Leave me alone.

505
00:48:53,892 --> 00:48:58,204
You're not going to take me
to the church.

506
00:49:09,825 --> 00:49:12,020
That's enough!

507
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:18,781
Here you go.

508
00:49:29,135 --> 00:49:32,366
Let me go!

509
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:46,474
Come on. Let's take her home.

510
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:49,488
You lot pick her up.

511
00:49:57,413 --> 00:50:00,291
You've made her faint.

512
00:50:00,457 --> 00:50:02,846
Careful with her head.

513
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:05,720
Stop meddling and shut your mouth.

514
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,251
Put her on the chair.

515
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:19,381
A glass of water, quickly.

516
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:28,924
Drink.

517
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,729
Let's go.

518
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,154
Nicola, go to the hospital.

519
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:10,264
If you can't find the doctor in charge,
look for his assistant or Dr Basilicò.

520
00:51:10,483 --> 00:51:12,474
Hurry up.

521
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:16,432
What's going on?

522
00:51:38,218 --> 00:51:40,209
Open up. I'm a doctor.

523
00:51:48,937 --> 00:51:52,168
- You're a doctor from the mainland?
- Yes.

524
00:51:52,357 --> 00:51:54,951
She's wounded. You hit her. I saw you.

525
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:58,625
Doctor, you have to understand,
she doesn't want to marry Totino.

526
00:51:58,822 --> 00:52:02,371
That's not true. I don't want her
any more because she's not a virgin.

527
00:52:02,575 --> 00:52:05,214
He's a doctor from the mainland.

528
00:52:08,372 --> 00:52:09,851
You have to understand.

529
00:52:09,957 --> 00:52:13,745
Coward! I don't want him! He's
insulted me. I'm going to kill myself.

530
00:52:13,961 --> 00:52:15,952
Make way. Excuse me.

531
00:52:16,088 --> 00:52:18,239
- Doctor, we want to know.
- You will know.

532
00:52:18,383 --> 00:52:20,374
Get out of the way.

533
00:52:23,262 --> 00:52:25,981
I don't want to. I don't want to.

534
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,335
Outside. Come on. Everybody outside.

535
00:52:28,475 --> 00:52:30,466
Quickly.

536
00:52:49,704 --> 00:52:52,059
No, don't be afraid. I'm a friend.

537
00:52:52,207 --> 00:52:54,926
No, they're all cowards.

538
00:52:55,084 --> 00:52:58,633
No, don't cry. Don't cry, Addolorata.

539
00:52:58,838 --> 00:53:02,797
You'll see that one day all Sicilian
women will be freed from slavery...

540
00:53:03,008 --> 00:53:06,240
from slavery... from the laws.

541
00:53:06,429 --> 00:53:09,660
We'll be the new Thousand
when we set you free.

542
00:53:21,109 --> 00:53:24,306
My car's outside. Quick,
I'll take you away. I'll save you.

543
00:53:24,488 --> 00:53:28,003
Do you have relatives in town?
No, forget relatives.

544
00:53:28,199 --> 00:53:31,078
- I'll take you to a convent with nuns.
- Nuns?

545
00:53:31,245 --> 00:53:34,282
Yes. I'll come to visit you.
I'll see to everything.

546
00:53:34,456 --> 00:53:38,813
You're right not to want to marry that man
who doesn't believe you're pure.

547
00:53:39,044 --> 00:53:40,523
He doesn't deserve you.

548
00:53:40,628 --> 00:53:42,346
You're so pretty.

549
00:53:42,464 --> 00:53:44,580
Who knows, one day you and I...

550
00:53:44,716 --> 00:53:48,595
Let's escape and you'll see that the truth
will come out sooner or later.

551
00:53:48,803 --> 00:53:53,035
If the truth comes out, I'm done for.
They'll kill me.

552
00:53:56,186 --> 00:53:58,177
But you're a virgin, aren't you?

553
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,000
- I was.
- You were?

554
00:54:04,151 --> 00:54:06,824
Then a travelling salesman
from Piedmont,

555
00:54:06,987 --> 00:54:09,296
blond and handsome, had me.

556
00:54:09,448 --> 00:54:11,803
- His name was Renato.
- Renato.

557
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:14,510
It was love. I loved him.

558
00:54:14,661 --> 00:54:18,017
Then there was the carabiniere
I was with last year,

559
00:54:18,207 --> 00:54:19,925
whose name was Costantino...

560
00:54:20,042 --> 00:54:22,715
Costantino the carabiniere.
Who else was there?

561
00:54:22,878 --> 00:54:25,517
Well, there was Carlo,
a petty officer from Bari.

562
00:54:25,672 --> 00:54:27,981
Carlo the petty officer from Bari.

563
00:54:28,133 --> 00:54:30,488
- Pietro the driver.
- Pietro the driver.

564
00:54:30,635 --> 00:54:34,628
- My cousin Luigi from Navarro.
- Cousin Luigi from Navarro.

565
00:54:34,847 --> 00:54:37,281
- Frustone...
- Frustone too!

566
00:54:37,433 --> 00:54:41,108
- Then there was Antonio Verdesame.
- What are you...

567
00:54:41,312 --> 00:54:42,507
And that's it.

568
00:54:42,606 --> 00:54:46,076
But I always did it for love, Doctor.
Believe me.

569
00:54:48,611 --> 00:54:51,079
Don't look at me with that serious face,
Doctor.

570
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:54,834
You mustn't betray me. You've
got to help me or they'll kill me.

571
00:54:55,034 --> 00:54:57,707
Yes. I understand. Yes.

572
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:00,430
I'll help you, yes.

573
00:55:00,581 --> 00:55:03,175
- You're a good man, Doctor.
- A good man.

574
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:06,484
It'll stay our secret, I swear.

575
00:55:06,671 --> 00:55:09,868
You're so kind, you mainland people.

576
00:55:12,092 --> 00:55:13,081
It's stuck!

577
00:55:13,177 --> 00:55:19,366
Kind, generous,
handsome, really handsome.

578
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:22,322
You're all cherubs, archangels.

579
00:55:22,477 --> 00:55:26,026
Yeah? Archangels?
My love! Archangels! My love!

580
00:55:34,906 --> 00:55:39,536
- It's taking a long time.
- He's a conscientious doctor.

581
00:55:40,536 --> 00:55:41,685
How can you do that?

582
00:55:48,502 --> 00:55:50,493
Here's Dr Basilicò.

583
00:55:54,925 --> 00:55:56,917
I kiss your hand, Doctor.

584
00:55:58,804 --> 00:56:01,443
A colleague of yours is here already.

585
00:56:02,725 --> 00:56:07,162
I'll do things properly
and wait until my colleague's finished.

586
00:56:07,396 --> 00:56:10,866
Doctor, you're here for a consultation
so let's get on with it.

587
00:56:11,066 --> 00:56:13,899
If you think that's the case.

588
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,271
Doctor.

589
00:56:21,868 --> 00:56:24,143
Doctor!

590
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:36,121
Well?

591
00:56:40,177 --> 00:56:43,089
- Virgin.
- May God reward you.

592
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,697
So what's wrong with her?

593
00:56:44,807 --> 00:56:48,083
You may wish to speak to your colleague,
Dr Basilicò.

594
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:00,447
- Jesus!
- Goodbye.

595
00:57:00,572 --> 00:57:03,882
- Let's get him!
- What the hell's going on?

596
00:57:04,075 --> 00:57:06,589
Quick!

597
00:57:09,414 --> 00:57:11,769
Come back!

598
00:57:11,917 --> 00:57:15,671
Hurry up, Salvatore.
Follow him on your motorbike.

599
00:57:17,255 --> 00:57:18,529
What are you doing?

600
00:57:20,341 --> 00:57:22,809
Quick!

601
00:57:22,969 --> 00:57:24,925
Come on!

602
00:57:43,489 --> 00:57:46,720
- Wait!
- You scoundrel!

603
00:57:54,332 --> 00:57:55,765
Stop or I'll kill you.

604
00:58:06,302 --> 00:58:08,179
Go on, go on!

605
00:58:16,729 --> 00:58:18,879
Turn right. Go across the field.

606
00:58:19,023 --> 00:58:21,857
- Let's take a short cut.
- Go on, faster!

607
00:58:36,832 --> 00:58:39,790
Idiot!

608
00:58:43,379 --> 00:58:44,573
ROAD UP
DANGER

609
00:58:45,298 --> 00:58:47,290
Damn!

610
00:59:10,281 --> 00:59:12,078
Justice has been done.

611
00:59:25,921 --> 00:59:28,913
Hire car lost and paid for.

612
00:59:29,091 --> 00:59:31,321
Multiple ecchymosis, lacerations,

613
00:59:31,468 --> 00:59:34,267
sprained ankle,
massive haematoma in right buttock,

614
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:37,342
heart in a state, mortal danger.

615
00:59:37,516 --> 00:59:40,314
Professor's prediction
came true once more.

616
00:59:40,477 --> 00:59:43,833
In the moment of danger
I vowed to keep on fighting

617
00:59:44,022 --> 00:59:46,092
and escape from the demon.

618
00:59:51,112 --> 00:59:52,511
There's only one way.

619
01:00:19,764 --> 01:00:21,595
Who is it at this time of night?

620
01:00:21,725 --> 01:00:24,798
- Monsignor.
- Who is it?

621
01:00:24,979 --> 01:00:27,539
- Monsignor, it's me.
- Andrea, you've come back.

622
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:31,478
- Yes, I've come back.
- You've come back.

623
01:00:31,693 --> 01:00:33,411
Yes, I've come back.

624
01:00:33,528 --> 01:00:37,680
Andrea, hold me tight.
You're shaking. You're emotional.

625
01:00:37,907 --> 01:00:40,182
No, your umbrella's
dripping down my neck.

626
01:00:40,326 --> 01:00:42,840
I'm sorry. Let's go, Andrea, come on.

627
01:00:42,995 --> 01:00:45,384
- You've come back.
- Yes, I've come back.

628
01:00:45,539 --> 01:00:49,453
- Michelantonio! Rosina!
- Who is it at this time of night?

629
01:00:49,669 --> 01:00:51,148
Who's here?

630
01:00:51,254 --> 01:00:54,690
He's come back.
The prodigal son has come back.

631
01:00:54,882 --> 01:00:57,396
Welcome him because,
as the Bible says,

632
01:00:57,552 --> 01:01:01,022
we mustn't shame the man
who has changed his bad ways.

633
01:01:01,222 --> 01:01:04,259
Remember that we are all guilty.

634
01:01:04,433 --> 01:01:07,106
Welcome him
because he has come back to us.

635
01:01:07,269 --> 01:01:09,988
Welcome him! Welcome him!

636
01:01:10,147 --> 01:01:14,744
- OK, but come up.
- Quickly, or you'll catch your death.

637
01:01:18,739 --> 01:01:20,650
- I've come back.
- Andrea!

638
01:01:20,782 --> 01:01:22,613
- Forgive me.
- You've come back.

639
01:01:22,743 --> 01:01:24,335
- Thank you.
- How wonderful!

640
01:01:24,452 --> 01:01:26,682
- You've always been good to me.
- No, no.

641
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:28,946
- Yes, it's true.
- How are you?

642
01:01:29,082 --> 01:01:32,313
- I've come back.
- You seem a bit run down.

643
01:01:32,502 --> 01:01:34,777
- Yes, but now...
- A little bit.

644
01:01:34,921 --> 01:01:36,913
Gigliola.

645
01:01:38,758 --> 01:01:39,986
Gigliola!

646
01:02:20,548 --> 01:02:24,143
Come forward a bit more, darling,
towards the left.

647
01:02:24,344 --> 01:02:26,414
That's it. Up there.

648
01:02:28,056 --> 01:02:30,047
Don't move.

649
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,635
Come here, children.

650
01:03:01,713 --> 01:03:03,431
There, Giuseppina.

651
01:03:03,548 --> 01:03:05,539
Thank you, sweetheart.

652
01:03:19,606 --> 01:03:23,315
Reunited under the willow trees,
happy and ecstatic,

653
01:03:23,526 --> 01:03:25,517
let's drink from our holy chalices.

654
01:03:25,653 --> 01:03:28,167
Long live the happy couple!

655
01:03:28,322 --> 01:03:31,951
Monsignor,
there aren't any willow trees here.

656
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:34,389
Poetic licence.

657
01:03:34,536 --> 01:03:37,256
What willow trees? Weeping willows?

658
01:03:37,415 --> 01:03:39,565
We all want to be happy here.

659
01:03:39,709 --> 01:03:43,941
Chalices are good, though,
to toast these two lovebirds.

660
01:03:44,171 --> 01:03:46,287
Long live the lovebirds!

661
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:31,623
Come in.

662
01:04:34,345 --> 01:04:36,905
- Gigliola.
- I need to talk to you.

663
01:04:39,099 --> 01:04:41,090
What's happened?

664
01:04:43,311 --> 01:04:45,825
You don't seem happy.

665
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:48,521
What do you mean, my dove?

666
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:51,119
What makes you think this?

667
01:04:51,278 --> 01:04:53,917
Because I'm not happy either.

668
01:04:54,072 --> 01:04:57,109
We're not those perfect creatures
that we thought we were.

669
01:04:57,284 --> 01:04:58,763
No?

670
01:04:58,869 --> 01:05:01,508
You're an exuberant man,
full of desires.

671
01:05:01,663 --> 01:05:03,972
Other women will surrender to you
like I did.

672
01:05:04,123 --> 01:05:06,637
And I'll lose you forever.

673
01:05:06,793 --> 01:05:09,512
No. No, my dear Gigliola.

674
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:13,743
If you stay by my side, close to me,
I'll manage.

675
01:05:13,966 --> 01:05:16,925
I can't help you
because I'm tempted too.

676
01:05:17,095 --> 01:05:20,405
- Really?
- I talked to Uncle Monsignor about it.

677
01:05:20,598 --> 01:05:23,874
He said that it's an acceptable desire,

678
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:28,053
but he's never believed in
our intentions to remain chaste.

679
01:05:28,272 --> 01:05:30,706
Well, we'll make him believe in them.

680
01:05:30,858 --> 01:05:33,418
No. Come to my bedroom.

681
01:05:35,445 --> 01:05:38,642
When? Where? Now?

682
01:05:38,824 --> 01:05:41,896
Andrea, we've lost our battle.

683
01:05:42,077 --> 01:05:43,954
We may as well surrender at once.

684
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:47,276
I'll be waiting for you at midnight.
Will you come?

685
01:05:47,457 --> 01:05:50,813
Yes. Of course,
my love, my love, my love.

686
01:05:51,002 --> 01:05:54,517
My love, my love,
my love, my love, my love.

687
01:05:54,714 --> 01:05:56,545
Tell me how to avoid being seen.

688
01:05:56,674 --> 01:05:59,666
Shall I come in through the window,
climb up the wall?

689
01:05:59,844 --> 01:06:02,642
You're on the third floor.

690
01:06:02,805 --> 01:06:06,515
I'll use the gardener's ladder.
Put some oil on the hinges.

691
01:06:06,726 --> 01:06:09,604
No. No.
You've got a fireplace in your room.

692
01:06:09,771 --> 01:06:11,966
I'll come down the chimney.

693
01:06:12,106 --> 01:06:14,381
Tell me how to get up on the roof, darling.

694
01:06:14,525 --> 01:06:18,996
I'll go along the gutter or along
the eaves. That's better, isn't it?

695
01:06:19,238 --> 01:06:22,435
It's better if you come in
through the door, from the corridor.

696
01:06:22,616 --> 01:06:26,131
- But Uncle Monsignor...
- He's away, giving the last rites.

697
01:06:26,328 --> 01:06:28,638
And my mother knows about it.

698
01:06:31,959 --> 01:06:34,234
Your mother knows about it?

699
01:06:34,378 --> 01:06:37,051
Yes, I felt I had to tell her
out of a sense of loyalty.

700
01:06:37,214 --> 01:06:39,330
She's more than a mother,
she's a friend.

701
01:06:39,466 --> 01:06:40,694
Your mother...

702
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:44,110
It was difficult at first
to get her consent but she gave in.

703
01:06:44,304 --> 01:06:45,293
Your mother...

704
01:06:45,388 --> 01:06:47,504
And she knows
that we'll be married soon.

705
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,949
She'll break it to my father tactfully.

706
01:06:50,101 --> 01:06:51,979
- She's been so modern...
- Your mother...

707
01:06:52,104 --> 01:06:55,653
She even put a big bouquet of flowers
in my bedroom.

708
01:06:55,857 --> 01:06:57,848
Do you love me?

709
01:06:59,485 --> 01:07:01,476
Of course.

710
01:07:01,612 --> 01:07:06,970
If I think about it, my dear Gigliola,
I don't want to disrespect you.

711
01:07:10,788 --> 01:07:12,779
Disrespect me.

712
01:08:14,183 --> 01:08:17,892
My darling Gigliola, the poet said,

713
01:08:18,103 --> 01:08:21,061
"An unplucked flower
is loved by nobody."

714
01:08:21,231 --> 01:08:23,950
I love you
and yet I'm not going to pluck you.

715
01:08:24,108 --> 01:08:27,145
Your offer is too generous.
I don't deserve it.

716
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:31,633
If I ever want to lose my way,
it won't be by dishonouring you.

717
01:08:31,867 --> 01:08:33,823
And I really think I will lose my way.

718
01:08:33,952 --> 01:08:36,864
So forget me, if you can.
Forgive me.

719
01:08:37,038 --> 01:08:38,994
But it's all superstition.

720
01:08:39,123 --> 01:08:42,399
You're stuck in the Middle Ages
and deny the evidence.

721
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:45,941
The facts are irrefutable.
You all know that.

722
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:51,158
He underestimated the danger and went
to bed with this deadly pedicurist woman.

723
01:08:51,426 --> 01:08:54,225
- What is it?
- One coffee.

724
01:08:54,389 --> 01:08:56,380
He became paralysed.

725
01:08:56,516 --> 01:09:00,748
Onorata's brother jumped into bed
with her. Well, his house caught fire.

726
01:09:00,978 --> 01:09:04,368
Of course. And the station master
who broke his arm.

727
01:09:04,565 --> 01:09:06,874
That accountant from Cerignola died.

728
01:09:07,025 --> 01:09:11,257
That's right.
And that other guy in the car crash.

729
01:09:11,488 --> 01:09:14,525
Another one was in a bomb blast.

730
01:09:14,699 --> 01:09:18,818
He said Santina only gave him one kiss.

731
01:09:19,037 --> 01:09:22,586
And you say it's all superstition.
Do me a favour, you go and see her.

732
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:24,986
Everyone's been affected.

733
01:09:25,126 --> 01:09:28,562
Everyone. No doubt about it,
Santina is a jinx.

734
01:09:28,755 --> 01:09:30,871
Believe me, she brings bad luck.

735
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:33,726
You're right. She really is evil.

736
01:09:33,885 --> 01:09:39,960
I would rather sleep with a man
than do it with her.

737
01:09:40,265 --> 01:09:45,260
Excuse me, where does
this pedicurist Santina work?

738
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:22,796
PEDICURIST

739
01:10:27,186 --> 01:10:31,066
- Santina?
- Yes?

740
01:10:31,274 --> 01:10:33,265
A pedicure?

741
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:02,307
It's really pretty here.

742
01:11:02,429 --> 01:11:05,023
Original, very nicely done.

743
01:11:07,976 --> 01:11:09,967
Can I sit down? Thank you.

744
01:11:17,193 --> 01:11:21,312
Perhaps this is the consulting room...

745
01:11:21,531 --> 01:11:23,840
But I don't see a bed.

746
01:11:28,913 --> 01:11:30,107
Ingenious.

747
01:11:30,206 --> 01:11:32,242
- Are you a stranger here?
- Yes.

748
01:11:32,374 --> 01:11:33,409
Where are you from?

749
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:37,652
Santina, do you want to kill him too?

750
01:11:37,879 --> 01:11:40,712
Ugly sons of beasts!

751
01:11:40,882 --> 01:11:44,114
Get away from here, you filthy pigs!

752
01:11:44,303 --> 01:11:46,976
Cuckolds! Wretches!

753
01:11:47,139 --> 01:11:48,936
Poofs!

754
01:11:49,057 --> 01:11:50,809
Go and find your sisters.

755
01:11:50,934 --> 01:11:53,084
Go away! Go away!

756
01:11:53,228 --> 01:11:56,106
- Scoundrels!
- Here.

757
01:11:56,273 --> 01:11:57,911
Cuckolds!

758
01:11:58,024 --> 01:12:02,620
Excuse me, Santina.
Let them go away, please.

759
01:12:05,072 --> 01:12:09,988
I'm really sorry, but they're riffraff
that I had to deal with in the past.

760
01:12:10,245 --> 01:12:12,839
I know what they say about you.

761
01:12:12,997 --> 01:12:14,350
- You know?
- Yes.

762
01:12:14,457 --> 01:12:16,493
- You know and you came regardless?
- Yes.

763
01:12:16,626 --> 01:12:20,938
Beautiful stranger. You're a real man,
not like those cowards.

764
01:12:21,172 --> 01:12:24,289
You came regardless,
like St Nicholas the Saviour.

765
01:12:24,466 --> 01:12:26,821
And you've even got a silk shirt.

766
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,829
Look at him.

767
01:12:31,973 --> 01:12:33,965
He's not afraid of your lies.

768
01:12:34,101 --> 01:12:37,013
He'll make you see
how wicked you've been.

769
01:12:37,187 --> 01:12:39,496
I jinx you, you filthy creatures.

770
01:12:39,648 --> 01:12:42,116
It's not a good idea, Santina...

771
01:12:45,904 --> 01:12:48,782
- Come on. I'll make you happy.
- Yes.

772
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:53,695
Gently. Oh, God. Gently.

773
01:13:00,168 --> 01:13:02,159
Does it show much?

774
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:05,522
No.

775
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:07,709
I wanted to iron it for you

776
01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:11,312
but as soon as I touched it with
the iron it burned, like in a comic.

777
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:14,072
It must be really fine silk. I'm sorry.

778
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:17,533
It doesn't matter, darling.
It doesn't matter.

779
01:13:19,519 --> 01:13:22,592
- Would you like a coffee?
- Yes, thank you.

780
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:28,294
You're so clever, sweetheart.

781
01:13:31,406 --> 01:13:33,761
- Are you happy?
- Very much so.

782
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:36,981
Before they started saying
that I bring bad luck,

783
01:13:37,162 --> 01:13:40,154
at least five thousand people
had gone to bed with me

784
01:13:40,331 --> 01:13:42,891
and they were all satisfied, all happy.

785
01:13:43,042 --> 01:13:47,002
If ten or so died or were injured,
I think it's a fair rate, don't you?

786
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:48,567
It's not many at all.

787
01:13:48,673 --> 01:13:52,063
And so I ask myself,
what do these wretched people want?

788
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:54,490
They've made me starve.

789
01:13:54,637 --> 01:13:56,787
Because they're cowards, they're mean.

790
01:13:56,931 --> 01:13:58,728
Sorry, speaking of which...

791
01:13:59,892 --> 01:14:02,360
- This...
- No, no. I can't accept it.

792
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:03,714
- No.
- Please.

793
01:14:03,812 --> 01:14:07,691
You've already given me so much.
A magnificent present.

794
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:10,973
- What's the matter?
- Someone that I don't want to meet.

795
01:14:11,154 --> 01:14:15,147
- Is there another way out?
- Yes, over the roofs. It's easy.

796
01:14:22,247 --> 01:14:24,841
- Behind those roofs there's an alley.
- Simple.

797
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,391
Bye, Santina. What they say about you
is absurd. Nobody should believe it.

798
01:14:29,629 --> 01:14:30,618
Goodbye.

799
01:14:30,713 --> 01:14:32,704
- All the best.
- Thank you.

800
01:14:47,688 --> 01:14:49,758
Mind you don't slip.

801
01:14:58,199 --> 01:15:00,793
Help!

802
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:04,122
He's alive!

803
01:15:04,246 --> 01:15:08,683
He's ruined me! He's ruined me!

804
01:15:08,917 --> 01:15:10,066
That's that.

805
01:15:10,669 --> 01:15:13,706
20 days after my ill-omened escape
from Altamura

806
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:17,429
I was involved in NATO manoeuvres
near Vicenza.

807
01:15:49,832 --> 01:15:50,821
What are you doing?

808
01:15:50,917 --> 01:15:53,431
The engine's stalled, Major.
I'll have a look.

809
01:15:53,586 --> 01:15:56,783
- I order you to start it again.
- I'll try, Major.

810
01:15:56,964 --> 01:16:00,479
You're making me look like a fool
in front of the General Staff.

811
01:16:00,676 --> 01:16:03,110
- The spark plugs are wet.
- Start it somehow.

812
01:16:03,261 --> 01:16:06,014
- Consider yourself locked up.
- I knew it.

813
01:16:18,485 --> 01:16:19,759
It's you.

814
01:16:21,571 --> 01:16:25,849
General, a message
from Blue Fox Command.

815
01:16:26,075 --> 01:16:29,431
Your division has been exposed
too much in Zone 5A

816
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:33,454
and must unfortunately
consider itself annihilated.

817
01:16:36,669 --> 01:16:40,025
And what's worse, your General Staff
has been taken prisoner,

818
01:16:40,214 --> 01:16:41,772
including you, General.

819
01:17:02,528 --> 01:17:04,883
Defeated. Damnation.

820
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:08,943
- The enemy used lasers.
- What?

821
01:17:10,577 --> 01:17:12,807
Death rays.

822
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:22,972
Manoeuvres over, General Staff
attend concert in their honour.

823
01:18:43,334 --> 01:18:45,404
Darling. Sweetheart. How are you?

824
01:18:45,544 --> 01:18:48,661
- Were we this familiar before?
- We can be even more familiar.

825
01:18:48,839 --> 01:18:51,114
I knew I'd find you.
I need to talk to you.

826
01:18:51,258 --> 01:18:54,455
Watch out. He's coming.
Three minutes have already gone by.

827
01:18:54,636 --> 01:18:56,035
Come to the auction tomorrow.

828
01:18:56,137 --> 01:18:58,697
Does he even check up on you
when you go...

829
01:18:58,848 --> 01:19:00,839
All the time.

830
01:19:02,102 --> 01:19:04,093
TOILET

831
01:19:15,489 --> 01:19:18,561
2,700,000 lire. Sold.

832
01:19:18,742 --> 01:19:22,257
Allow me, sir, to congratulate you
on behalf of the house.

833
01:19:22,454 --> 01:19:27,529
You have won a thrilling contest
and acquired an exceptional piece.

834
01:19:27,793 --> 01:19:31,468
Now let's move on
to number 412 in the catalogue,

835
01:19:31,672 --> 01:19:35,028
one of the most valuable pieces
in the collection.

836
01:19:35,217 --> 01:19:39,574
A rare piece, dating back
to the 12th or 13th century.

837
01:19:39,805 --> 01:19:41,955
It is an example of Annamese art

838
01:19:42,098 --> 01:19:45,408
which, until the end
of the 19th century in Asia,

839
01:19:45,602 --> 01:19:50,313
was under the influence
of the great Chinese ceramic tradition.

840
01:19:50,566 --> 01:19:53,034
There are very few examples of this
in the world.

841
01:19:53,193 --> 01:19:56,390
This one here was taken
from the Temple of Tamarida

842
01:19:56,571 --> 01:20:00,325
by Admiral Ottavio Padoan in 1886,

843
01:20:00,533 --> 01:20:02,603
when he was consul.

844
01:20:02,743 --> 01:20:05,098
You're crazy. You want to ruin me.

845
01:20:07,456 --> 01:20:12,450
He's as deaf as a post.
He can only understand by reading lips.

846
01:20:12,711 --> 01:20:14,862
How come he goes to concerts
if he's deaf?

847
01:20:15,006 --> 01:20:16,359
He never leaves me.

848
01:20:16,466 --> 01:20:17,979
<i>...Java in the 18th century.</i>

849
01:20:18,092 --> 01:20:21,607
It consists of a stoneware dog,
half-glazed at great heat,

850
01:20:21,804 --> 01:20:24,637
an excellent example
of Annamese ceramics.

851
01:20:24,807 --> 01:20:27,924
Count, you are very fond
of this type of art.

852
01:20:28,101 --> 01:20:30,376
What do you think of this piece?

853
01:20:32,397 --> 01:20:34,991
He asked what you think of it.

854
01:20:35,150 --> 01:20:39,508
It's marvellous, but I'm
certainly not going to tell him that.

855
01:20:41,698 --> 01:20:43,848
200,000. Thank you very much, Count.

856
01:20:43,992 --> 01:20:46,506
First bid, 200,000.

857
01:20:46,661 --> 01:20:50,495
- 300,000.
- 300,000. The gentleman bids 300,000.

858
01:20:51,999 --> 01:20:55,514
- 300,000.
- Go up to a million.

859
01:20:55,711 --> 01:20:59,181
- 400,000.
- We have a bid of 400,000.

860
01:20:59,381 --> 01:21:01,133
500,000.

861
01:21:01,258 --> 01:21:03,978
- I don't even know your name.
- Thelma. T-H.

862
01:21:04,137 --> 01:21:05,889
600,000.

863
01:21:06,013 --> 01:21:08,243
Where, when can we see each other?
300,000!

864
01:21:08,391 --> 01:21:11,110
Sorry, sir,
but you've already been outbid.

865
01:21:11,268 --> 01:21:12,781
We're on 700,000.

866
01:21:13,937 --> 01:21:16,053
- Any advances?
- Sorry.

867
01:21:16,190 --> 01:21:19,102
- 800,000.
- 800,000.

868
01:21:19,276 --> 01:21:21,506
- 900.
- 900,000.

869
01:21:23,988 --> 01:21:26,867
I need to see you alone. Soon. At once.

870
01:21:27,034 --> 01:21:29,184
This man that I hate
makes it impossible.

871
01:21:29,328 --> 01:21:33,207
I'll free you, Thelma. I'll free you
from the monster. My name's Andrea.

872
01:21:33,415 --> 01:21:36,487
1,200,000? 1,300,000? Sold.

873
01:21:36,668 --> 01:21:40,456
- The gentleman has got a good bargain.
- What's happened?

874
01:21:40,672 --> 01:21:42,947
- What did he bid?
- One million.

875
01:22:27,217 --> 01:22:29,208
At ease.

876
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:34,406
What are you doing?
Are you mad?

877
01:22:35,516 --> 01:22:36,585
What...

878
01:22:36,684 --> 01:22:39,323
- It's for the moths.
- Couldn't you use DDT?

879
01:22:39,478 --> 01:22:41,913
No, the bullets make it look moth-eaten.

880
01:22:42,065 --> 01:22:44,215
That way it becomes an antique.

881
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:47,590
Kid, where are you going?
Bring that frame over here.

882
01:22:47,778 --> 01:22:49,291
Ingenious.

883
01:22:49,405 --> 01:22:53,398
That's no good.
You have to do it all over again.

884
01:22:53,617 --> 01:22:54,606
Bye, Ovidio.

885
01:22:54,702 --> 01:22:56,658
Ovidio, this is no good, you know.

886
01:22:56,787 --> 01:22:59,062
This is a delicate job.
You've got to do it well.

887
01:22:59,206 --> 01:23:03,996
Look at this stuff.
No, make him do it again.

888
01:23:04,253 --> 01:23:06,972
Tell him to give it another coat.

889
01:23:07,131 --> 01:23:11,647
What are you doing?
Those cherubs have just been plastered.

890
01:23:11,885 --> 01:23:13,921
Damn!

891
01:23:15,472 --> 01:23:20,068
What are you doing, Beppo? This
isn't 18th-century, it's Renaissance.

892
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:22,665
- Listen, I need...
- What are you doing?

893
01:23:22,812 --> 01:23:24,404
- Are you sitting down?
- No.

894
01:23:24,522 --> 01:23:27,639
No. The Lombard throne will collapse.

895
01:23:27,817 --> 01:23:30,048
It's fake.

896
01:23:30,195 --> 01:23:34,427
Listen, sir, I'll be honest with you.

897
01:23:34,657 --> 01:23:36,534
- Everything here is fake.
- I believe you.

898
01:23:36,659 --> 01:23:40,572
Even the certificates
of pedigree and expertise.

899
01:23:40,788 --> 01:23:43,825
The only antique here is me.

900
01:23:43,999 --> 01:23:46,467
Do you want something nice?
I'll show you. Look.

901
01:23:46,627 --> 01:23:48,219
We've got some masterpieces.

902
01:23:48,337 --> 01:23:51,886
Do you want a Etruscan vase
that's just been dug up?

903
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:55,606
Look how beautiful it is.
The drawings, the colour, the shape...

904
01:23:55,803 --> 01:23:58,476
- Interesting...
- You're not interested in that?

905
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:00,231
There's lots of stuff here.

906
01:24:00,349 --> 01:24:04,706
That's lovely. Have a look
at this pair of Baroque-style angels.

907
01:24:04,936 --> 01:24:09,214
Late 18th-century. Just out of the kiln.
Hot as a pizza.

908
01:24:09,441 --> 01:24:10,840
They're beautiful.

909
01:24:10,942 --> 01:24:13,092
But I need something made to measure.

910
01:24:13,236 --> 01:24:14,635
- Made to measure?
- A copy.

911
01:24:14,737 --> 01:24:17,969
A copy? I can make you a copy.
Whatever material you like.

912
01:24:18,158 --> 01:24:20,752
What do you want? Ceramic? Bronze?

913
01:24:20,910 --> 01:24:23,868
Marble? Wood? Plaster?
Whatever you want, I'll make it.

914
01:24:24,038 --> 01:24:25,710
- Here. Look.
- Beautiful.

915
01:24:25,832 --> 01:24:28,551
Here are all the measurements.
How much will it cost?

916
01:24:28,709 --> 01:24:30,779
We do it by weight, like steaks.

917
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:35,994
Let me go and have a better look
in the light.

918
01:24:36,258 --> 01:24:39,295
Beautiful. Annamese dog.

919
01:24:39,469 --> 01:24:42,621
You were supposed to warn me
but you kept quiet. Look.

920
01:24:42,807 --> 01:24:45,196
How many times do I have to tell you,
for goodness' sake?

921
01:24:45,351 --> 01:24:48,627
Donatello! Donatello!

922
01:24:48,812 --> 01:24:49,961
Donatello.

923
01:24:50,064 --> 01:24:52,942
I told you that old-fashioned glaze
doesn't dry.

924
01:24:53,108 --> 01:24:55,338
Get the hairdryer and dry it.

925
01:24:55,485 --> 01:24:58,636
My Lord! This work takes a long time.

926
01:24:58,822 --> 01:25:01,131
- Yes, I understand, but how long?
- How long?

927
01:25:01,282 --> 01:25:03,796
With ceramics
it's a question of cooking.

928
01:25:03,951 --> 01:25:08,230
- Like spaghetti?
- Exactly! Like spaghetti. That's right.

929
01:25:51,748 --> 01:25:54,900
What a trip! Everything's rotten.

930
01:26:43,007 --> 01:26:44,884
- May I?
- Who is it?

931
01:26:45,008 --> 01:26:47,886
Do you remember me? I was
at the auction of the Padoan collection.

932
01:26:48,053 --> 01:26:50,044
I've got something for you.

933
01:27:08,573 --> 01:27:11,212
You were very annoyed
to miss out on buying the dog.

934
01:27:11,367 --> 01:27:14,040
Enunciate clearly.

935
01:27:14,203 --> 01:27:16,717
You were very annoyed

936
01:27:16,872 --> 01:27:19,750
to miss out on buying the dog.

937
01:27:19,917 --> 01:27:24,115
I found one exactly the same
and thought of you.

938
01:27:24,338 --> 01:27:27,091
My name is Andrea Rossi-Colo...

939
01:27:27,257 --> 01:27:32,537
I thought I'd fooled him, but that's because
I still didn't know him well.

940
01:27:32,805 --> 01:27:35,478
Incredible.

941
01:27:35,641 --> 01:27:39,429
- How did you manage to track it down?
- Trade secret.

942
01:27:41,271 --> 01:27:45,150
- Are you an antiquarian or a collector?
- Both.

943
01:27:45,358 --> 01:27:47,076
How much?

944
01:27:47,193 --> 01:27:51,789
The same price
that the other dog went for.

945
01:27:52,031 --> 01:27:54,022
Pay...

946
01:27:58,788 --> 01:28:01,143
Thelma.

947
01:28:01,290 --> 01:28:04,009
We've got a visitor. A very kind man.

948
01:28:05,628 --> 01:28:07,619
Look what he's brought me.

949
01:28:07,755 --> 01:28:09,950
Just for a million. Look.

950
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:16,138
- He's an antiquarian.
- Maybe he's a madman.

951
01:28:16,304 --> 01:28:17,976
- Enchanté.
- Antiquarian...

952
01:28:18,098 --> 01:28:20,533
Andrea Rossi-Colombotti.

953
01:28:20,684 --> 01:28:24,597
Mr Colombotti, you're a collector
as well as an antiquarian.

954
01:28:24,813 --> 01:28:27,930
Would you rather have money
or a piece of the same value?

955
01:28:28,108 --> 01:28:30,383
- Whatever you think, Count.
- Thank you.

956
01:28:30,527 --> 01:28:35,123
I'll offer you two cats worth 500,000 lire each
for your million-lire dog.

957
01:28:35,365 --> 01:28:37,959
Are you interested in pieces
that are hard to find?

958
01:28:38,117 --> 01:28:40,108
That's fine by me.

959
01:28:40,244 --> 01:28:43,316
They are two very valuable pieces.

960
01:28:43,497 --> 01:28:48,572
I found them in Indochina when I was
an officer in the Foreign Legion.

961
01:28:48,837 --> 01:28:50,509
I had their owner shot.

962
01:28:50,630 --> 01:28:54,418
He was a rebel who didn't want to die,
even when I was finishing him off.

963
01:28:54,634 --> 01:28:58,263
Have you come to set me free?
Aren't you afraid that he'll kill you?

964
01:28:58,470 --> 01:29:00,859
- I'll crush him like a snake.
- Yes, my darling.

965
01:29:07,270 --> 01:29:08,498
Silly of me. He's deaf.

966
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:13,831
<i>- I'm afraid he has a sixth sense.
- I'll show you a seventh one, darling.</i>

967
01:29:14,069 --> 01:29:15,866
The intoxication of daring love.

968
01:29:15,988 --> 01:29:18,104
Love is a mixture of risk and conquest

969
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:21,391
and we will taste it together,
drop by drop.

970
01:29:21,576 --> 01:29:23,646
Watch out. I can hear him coming.

971
01:29:23,787 --> 01:29:28,303
Yes, it's a stone, the metaphysical
perfection of the spherical form.

972
01:29:28,541 --> 01:29:31,533
Here. Look. They're intact.

973
01:29:31,711 --> 01:29:33,907
They're superb.

974
01:29:34,047 --> 01:29:37,005
I'd very much like to show you
my whole collection.

975
01:29:37,175 --> 01:29:39,166
I'm flattered.

976
01:29:40,678 --> 01:29:44,466
Today's Saturday. Why don't you
stay for the weekend with us?

977
01:29:44,682 --> 01:29:46,798
Thank you.

978
01:29:46,934 --> 01:29:50,085
Erminio. The gentleman
is staying as our guest.

979
01:29:50,270 --> 01:29:54,388
Have the ochre room prepared.
This evening we'll eat in the garden.

980
01:30:11,791 --> 01:30:15,943
We'll have a lot of plovers tomorrow
with this wind.

981
01:30:17,255 --> 01:30:20,884
- Do you like hunting, my friend?
- Not much. I prefer fishing.

982
01:30:21,092 --> 01:30:23,084
In moderation.

983
01:30:31,561 --> 01:30:33,995
Tonight will be our night.

984
01:30:52,081 --> 01:30:53,673
I've worked out how.

985
01:30:56,293 --> 01:30:59,524
How you're planning to crush the snake.

986
01:31:00,839 --> 01:31:05,708
- Who?
- With the big ball.

987
01:31:07,345 --> 01:31:09,301
The big ball?

988
01:31:51,304 --> 01:31:53,977
Be quiet.

989
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:56,256
Be quiet. Down! Down! Down!

990
01:31:56,392 --> 01:31:58,508
Good dog. Good dog.

991
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:55,082
- Come here.
- No.

992
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,430
If he wakes up
and sees that I'm not there...

993
01:32:59,787 --> 01:33:01,857
That's true. Let's stay here.

994
01:33:01,998 --> 01:33:03,750
- That way we can check on him.
- No.

995
01:33:03,875 --> 01:33:06,708
Yes. Isn't it exciting?

996
01:33:06,877 --> 01:33:10,631
So are you resolved? You hate that man
so much because you love me?

997
01:33:10,839 --> 01:33:12,592
- Yes?
- Yes.

998
01:33:12,717 --> 01:33:15,026
I'm so happy!

999
01:33:15,178 --> 01:33:18,773
But I don't want to know anything.

1000
01:33:18,973 --> 01:33:21,646
You will find the tool
for sawing the ball off its stand

1001
01:33:21,809 --> 01:33:23,925
behind the greenhouse in the garden.

1002
01:33:24,061 --> 01:33:25,096
Don't ask any more.

1003
01:33:25,187 --> 01:33:29,066
Ah, the big ball. Yes, I agree.
I won't ask any more.

1004
01:33:30,150 --> 01:33:32,505
- Ruin me.
- Gently.

1005
01:33:39,159 --> 01:33:42,117
Your days are numbered, you bastard.

1006
01:34:51,187 --> 01:34:52,779
Love me.

1007
01:34:52,897 --> 01:34:55,206
Who are you who have conquered me?

1008
01:34:55,358 --> 01:34:58,031
A bold condottiere with no scruples.

1009
01:34:58,194 --> 01:35:00,549
Yes, I'm bold, with no scruples.

1010
01:35:00,696 --> 01:35:03,813
- Say it again, louder.
- I'm bold, with no scruples.

1011
01:35:03,991 --> 01:35:07,745
- Louder.
- I'm bold, with no scruples.

1012
01:35:18,756 --> 01:35:22,032
- Behind the greenhouse. Remember.
- But aren't we...

1013
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:24,492
When you've done it. Resist.

1014
01:35:37,148 --> 01:35:39,344
Resist. Easier said than done.

1015
01:36:00,712 --> 01:36:03,864
I must always be free...

1016
01:36:17,312 --> 01:36:20,429
At dawn or at dusk...

1017
01:36:27,989 --> 01:36:31,459
I must always be free...

1018
01:36:49,092 --> 01:36:51,209
- Have you done it?
- Done it?

1019
01:36:51,345 --> 01:36:54,337
Oh, yes, don't worry.
It's men's business.

1020
01:36:54,515 --> 01:36:56,506
Kiss me instead.

1021
01:37:02,814 --> 01:37:06,090
You can't imagine
how harsh he was with me.

1022
01:37:07,444 --> 01:37:11,278
He made me give up opera,
theatre, everything.

1023
01:37:12,573 --> 01:37:15,486
He locked me up in this miserable house.

1024
01:37:15,661 --> 01:37:20,052
He killed the man I loved.
He'll kill you as well if you don't do it.

1025
01:37:23,918 --> 01:37:25,909
I've done it.

1026
01:38:30,650 --> 01:38:33,722
- My beautiful roses.
- Really beautiful.

1027
01:38:48,291 --> 01:38:50,282
Please.

1028
01:38:52,086 --> 01:38:55,318
- Please sit there.
- No, my dear, you're wrong.

1029
01:38:55,507 --> 01:38:58,101
Yesterday evening
Mr Rossi sat on the other seat.

1030
01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:01,411
I made a mistake yesterday evening.
He should sit between us.

1031
01:39:05,683 --> 01:39:07,674
Bad luck! I'm afraid for you now.

1032
01:39:07,810 --> 01:39:09,129
Control yourself, darling.

1033
01:39:09,228 --> 01:39:13,506
We have to postpone our plan,
but don't be distressed. Control yourself.

1034
01:39:13,732 --> 01:39:15,723
Are you made of steel?

1035
01:39:16,528 --> 01:39:19,520
Before she had realised
that the ball wasn't sawn off,

1036
01:39:19,697 --> 01:39:22,006
I would have slipped away.

1037
01:39:24,035 --> 01:39:27,425
I should shut the door properly
so it doesn't bang.

1038
01:39:33,335 --> 01:39:35,326
Wicked man.

1039
01:39:35,462 --> 01:39:39,057
He knows that the sight of a cut flower
torments my soul.

1040
01:39:41,927 --> 01:39:43,918
Wicked.

1041
01:39:58,735 --> 01:40:00,327
Without water?

1042
01:40:00,444 --> 01:40:04,119
It's unfair to prolong its agony pointlessly.

1043
01:40:33,435 --> 01:40:35,551
I hate it when doors bang.

1044
01:40:38,607 --> 01:40:40,165
- Here.
- Thank you.

1045
01:40:42,402 --> 01:40:46,111
Your roses, dear.
I'm going to wash my hands.

1046
01:40:52,495 --> 01:40:54,771
I never tire of admiring your courage.

1047
01:40:55,457 --> 01:40:56,572
Thank you.

1048
01:40:58,710 --> 01:41:03,340
- Countess, shall I fillet the fish?
- What's happening? I'm sinking.

1049
01:41:03,589 --> 01:41:05,739
- Good heavens! Are you hurt?
- No.

1050
01:41:05,883 --> 01:41:07,794
- I'll lift you up.
- Thank you.

1051
01:41:07,927 --> 01:41:09,963
How could that happen? I'm sorry.

1052
01:41:10,095 --> 01:41:14,885
It's nothing, just a bit of subsidence.
I'll move my chair to the right.

1053
01:41:47,882 --> 01:41:50,112
Stop, Erminio. Stop, stop.

1054
01:41:51,094 --> 01:41:53,528
I'll fillet the fish.
You don't do it properly.

1055
01:41:53,679 --> 01:41:55,874
Go and get the sauces. Go on.

1056
01:41:58,559 --> 01:42:00,356
Not everybody can fillet a fish.

1057
01:42:00,477 --> 01:42:02,866
A surgeon friend of mine can't do it.

1058
01:42:03,021 --> 01:42:06,776
Speaking of which, dear, I left my pills
upstairs in the bedroom.

1059
01:42:06,984 --> 01:42:09,657
Would you mind?
They're on my bedside table.

1060
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:13,574
- Can I go with you?
- No, Thelma knows where they are.

1061
01:42:16,493 --> 01:42:19,883
Mr Rossi-Colombotti,
you are a very lucky man

1062
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,071
to catch a cod in a river.

1063
01:42:22,207 --> 01:42:24,721
- Exceptionally.
- My mind's like a sieve.

1064
01:42:24,876 --> 01:42:28,710
Now I think about it, the pills are here
in the anteroom on the chest.

1065
01:42:28,921 --> 01:42:29,910
Thelma.

1066
01:42:30,548 --> 01:42:32,824
- I can go.
- Don't put yourself out.

1067
01:42:32,968 --> 01:42:34,879
- I'll go.
- Thelma.

1068
01:42:35,011 --> 01:42:37,844
Thelma. Thelma.

1069
01:42:49,483 --> 01:42:52,520
Countess, I've found the pills.

1070
01:42:54,488 --> 01:42:57,367
Andrea. Let's escape.

1071
01:42:57,533 --> 01:43:01,048
Don't be afraid, come on.
Control yourself, please.

1072
01:43:19,178 --> 01:43:20,817
The door!

1073
01:43:21,598 --> 01:43:22,633
No!

1074
01:43:24,226 --> 01:43:25,978
Help! It's the count.

1075
01:43:26,102 --> 01:43:28,013
The door, the stone ball.

1076
01:43:28,146 --> 01:43:30,899
Holy Mary,
it's crushed him like a focaccia.

1077
01:43:31,065 --> 01:43:34,535
- What are you talking about?
- Thank you, my avenger.

1078
01:43:34,735 --> 01:43:37,454
Avenger? It was an accident.
I didn't do anything.

1079
01:43:37,613 --> 01:43:40,923
That's what everyone will think.
Don't be afraid.

1080
01:43:41,116 --> 01:43:44,109
Only I know the truth.

1081
01:43:45,246 --> 01:43:49,319
Poor count. He was so wicked.

1082
01:43:49,542 --> 01:43:54,900
NATO MAJOR
RISKS LIFE IMPRISONMENT

1083
01:43:57,633 --> 01:44:01,103
TRIAL TO TAKE PLACE
AT THE VENICE ASSIZES NEXT MARCH

1084
01:44:03,805 --> 01:44:09,244
And now let's hear
from the widow Masotto-Brulé.

1085
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:11,511
THE LAW IS EQUAL FOR ALL

1086
01:44:47,139 --> 01:44:49,528
Gentlemen,

1087
01:44:49,683 --> 01:44:52,959
I have spent this time
in grief and prayer.

1088
01:44:54,562 --> 01:44:56,553
And remorse.

1089
01:44:57,566 --> 01:44:59,875
What I say is true.

1090
01:45:03,572 --> 01:45:06,644
He killed him. He killed him for love.

1091
01:45:06,825 --> 01:45:09,259
He risked everything for love.

1092
01:45:09,411 --> 01:45:15,202
- Be merciful.
- You're crazy! Despicable!

1093
01:45:17,001 --> 01:45:19,720
Explain how you came to know
the accused.

1094
01:45:20,212 --> 01:45:23,489
Our first romantic encounter?

1095
01:45:23,675 --> 01:45:25,950
I was on a bus with a friend

1096
01:45:26,094 --> 01:45:31,885
when suddenly, taking advantage
of the crowd, somebody touched me.

1097
01:45:33,100 --> 01:45:35,091
It was that pig there.

1098
01:45:37,396 --> 01:45:40,274
Why didn't you complain?

1099
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:43,671
Why would I do that?
I thought it was my friend.

1100
01:45:45,863 --> 01:45:50,095
I will say on the record that
nobody had ever kissed me like that.

1101
01:45:50,325 --> 01:45:53,283
Not just among the lions,
but away from them as well.

1102
01:45:55,789 --> 01:45:59,065
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

1103
01:45:59,250 --> 01:46:00,239
Say, "I swear."

1104
01:46:00,335 --> 01:46:03,805
I swear that if I catch him
I'll kill him.

1105
01:46:04,005 --> 01:46:07,395
Take him away.

1106
01:46:07,591 --> 01:46:09,741
Order!

1107
01:46:12,055 --> 01:46:12,965
Your Honour.

1108
01:46:13,056 --> 01:46:16,731
These are the witnesses
who should frighten my client?

1109
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:24,299
As soon as he heard our conversation
about the jinx woman

1110
01:46:24,567 --> 01:46:26,797
he was inflamed with love.

1111
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:29,981
He asked for her address
and went to her house.

1112
01:46:30,155 --> 01:46:33,465
No, what is important here
is the letter. The letter.

1113
01:46:33,658 --> 01:46:36,492
Your Honour,
I demand that the letter be produced

1114
01:46:36,662 --> 01:46:39,051
which my client
left on the table in the bar

1115
01:46:39,206 --> 01:46:41,436
and which the witness
omitted to mention.

1116
01:46:41,583 --> 01:46:43,892
I want to speak. I want to speak too.

1117
01:46:47,547 --> 01:46:51,176
He is an upright and honest man.

1118
01:46:51,968 --> 01:46:54,926
I was the one who... who...

1119
01:46:56,138 --> 01:46:59,415
forgetting all decency,
offered myself brazenly to him.

1120
01:46:59,601 --> 01:47:01,557
- Giglio...
- Michelantonio!

1121
01:47:01,686 --> 01:47:02,755
A doctor!

1122
01:47:02,854 --> 01:47:06,767
Andrea, I believe in you.
I'll wait for you, Andrea.

1123
01:47:06,983 --> 01:47:11,056
This, gentlemen of the jury,
is the man who was accused.

1124
01:47:15,366 --> 01:47:18,915
When I learned about what had happened
in the papers,

1125
01:47:19,119 --> 01:47:21,269
I wasn't at all surprised.

1126
01:47:21,413 --> 01:47:23,644
I knew very well that sooner or later

1127
01:47:23,791 --> 01:47:26,351
I would see this man again in the dock.

1128
01:47:26,502 --> 01:47:29,096
- Objection, Your Honour.
- Objection sustained.

1129
01:47:29,713 --> 01:47:33,388
At the time...
at the time I warned the accused.

1130
01:47:33,592 --> 01:47:37,426
I warned him.
I advised him to give up women.

1131
01:47:37,637 --> 01:47:41,949
But he didn't listen to me
and he became easy prey to them.

1132
01:47:42,183 --> 01:47:45,539
Prey to these cursed creatures,
these horrors, these gorgons.

1133
01:47:45,728 --> 01:47:49,768
You women should be
in that boy's place in the dock.

1134
01:47:49,983 --> 01:47:51,939
I'll kill you.

1135
01:47:52,068 --> 01:47:56,300
We should step on you,
you filthy serpents!

1136
01:47:56,531 --> 01:47:59,409
Vile sluts!

1137
01:47:59,575 --> 01:48:02,294
You're vampires! Witches!

1138
01:48:02,453 --> 01:48:05,331
Your Honour, an honest,
disinterested opinion

1139
01:48:05,497 --> 01:48:07,488
from a great scientific luminary.

1140
01:48:07,624 --> 01:48:09,023
An opinion that points

1141
01:48:09,126 --> 01:48:13,518
to the negative influence
of the gentle sex on my client.

1142
01:48:14,966 --> 01:48:19,642
ILLUSTRIOUS PSYCHIATRIST
ADMITTED TO NEUROLOGICAL CLINIC

1143
01:48:22,848 --> 01:48:26,079
If we don't want knowingly
to offend truth and justice,

1144
01:48:26,268 --> 01:48:29,544
if we don't want to commit an error
that will weigh on our lives,

1145
01:48:29,729 --> 01:48:31,799
if we want our consciences
to be in peace,

1146
01:48:31,940 --> 01:48:34,500
only one verdict
will come out of this court.

1147
01:48:34,650 --> 01:48:36,209
Life imprisonment.

1148
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:37,594
I object.

1149
01:48:37,696 --> 01:48:39,812
- How can you...
- I object.

1150
01:48:39,948 --> 01:48:44,544
- I object, I object, I object.
- Silence!

1151
01:48:44,786 --> 01:48:47,698
This is intolerable.

1152
01:48:47,872 --> 01:48:50,670
Everybody can speak except me.

1153
01:48:50,833 --> 01:48:55,588
Everybody's been maintaining for days
on end that I'm a monster, a killer.

1154
01:48:55,838 --> 01:48:58,227
It won't be long
before they convince me too.

1155
01:48:58,382 --> 01:49:00,613
Like my ex-girlfriend Noelle,

1156
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:03,069
who managed to convince me
that I was a...

1157
01:49:03,221 --> 01:49:07,134
- Can I say the word, Your Honour?
- No, you can't say anything.

1158
01:49:07,349 --> 01:49:09,544
Go on, say it,
so long as you're quick.

1159
01:49:09,685 --> 01:49:11,482
Thank you.

1160
01:49:11,603 --> 01:49:14,436
First of all, I'm not a monster.

1161
01:49:14,606 --> 01:49:17,916
What man doesn't take pleasure

1162
01:49:18,109 --> 01:49:23,661
in a little bit of fantasy,
the unexpected, mystery,

1163
01:49:23,948 --> 01:49:27,828
in that which should be
the most marvellous of all adventures?

1164
01:49:28,745 --> 01:49:31,384
Your Honour, what is
the most marvellous of all adventures?

1165
01:49:31,540 --> 01:49:33,053
Are you interrogating me now?

1166
01:49:33,166 --> 01:49:36,124
It's the conquest of a beloved woman.

1167
01:49:36,294 --> 01:49:39,127
But today, Your Honour,
what is there to conquer?

1168
01:49:39,297 --> 01:49:41,606
Women are too available, too easy.

1169
01:49:41,757 --> 01:49:44,066
You just whistle
and they fall into your arms.

1170
01:49:44,218 --> 01:49:46,209
Lucky you.

1171
01:49:48,765 --> 01:49:52,041
Of course,
there is a minimum requirement.

1172
01:49:52,226 --> 01:49:53,341
You're ugly.

1173
01:49:53,436 --> 01:49:56,872
A bit of respect...
for the court, at least.

1174
01:49:57,064 --> 01:50:01,899
- The accused must control himself.
- I'm sorry. I'll correct that.

1175
01:50:02,152 --> 01:50:04,586
The Public Prosecutor is handsome.

1176
01:50:07,324 --> 01:50:12,239
Oh, God. I admit that I could have
sometimes gone a bit too far.

1177
01:50:12,495 --> 01:50:15,772
But what am I supposed to do?
I don't like easy women.

1178
01:50:15,958 --> 01:50:19,951
Let's all appreciate the accused's
highly original philosophical theory,

1179
01:50:20,170 --> 01:50:22,479
which aims to show that man is a hunter

1180
01:50:22,631 --> 01:50:25,065
and that he is a champion hunter.

1181
01:50:25,216 --> 01:50:28,652
In fact, we found a corpse on his road.

1182
01:50:28,845 --> 01:50:31,279
No, one moment. I was getting there.

1183
01:50:33,307 --> 01:50:35,901
I am not a killer.

1184
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:39,098
What would I have had to gain
from killing that man?

1185
01:50:39,272 --> 01:50:41,866
He was the one who wanted to kill me.

1186
01:50:42,025 --> 01:50:44,539
He was the one who sawed off the ball
from its stand

1187
01:50:44,694 --> 01:50:48,369
because the ball fell onto my seat,
in my place.

1188
01:50:48,572 --> 01:50:50,369
And he sat there?

1189
01:50:50,491 --> 01:50:53,563
Tell us why the deceased
would have wanted to kill you.

1190
01:50:53,744 --> 01:50:55,302
Explain his motive.

1191
01:50:55,412 --> 01:50:57,846
Do I have to remind you
that he was very jealous?

1192
01:50:57,998 --> 01:51:01,274
Of course I know that.
Perhaps he found out about your affair.

1193
01:51:01,459 --> 01:51:02,893
- Did he catch you at it?
- No.

1194
01:51:03,003 --> 01:51:07,155
And he couldn't have heard your amorous
conversations. The deceased was deaf.

1195
01:51:07,382 --> 01:51:09,054
And who kicked the door?

1196
01:51:09,176 --> 01:51:11,929
That's enough of these
clumsy attempts to clear your name.

1197
01:51:12,095 --> 01:51:16,373
Your Honour, it seems to me that
the picture is more than clear, and...

1198
01:51:16,599 --> 01:51:18,794
One moment, Your Honour.

1199
01:51:18,935 --> 01:51:20,971
I'd like to call
the servant Erminio again.

1200
01:51:21,103 --> 01:51:26,383
When I arrived the count
was stamping on the earth with his foot.

1201
01:51:26,651 --> 01:51:30,405
After he'd moved the major's chair

1202
01:51:30,613 --> 01:51:35,926
he had his back to the door
when it suddenly closed.

1203
01:51:36,202 --> 01:51:39,319
The poor man hardly had time
to turn round

1204
01:51:39,496 --> 01:51:44,047
and shout, "The door!" when the ball
came crashing down on his head.

1205
01:51:44,293 --> 01:51:45,965
Stop!

1206
01:51:46,086 --> 01:51:47,997
"Hardly had time to turn round."

1207
01:51:48,129 --> 01:51:49,642
- Is that what you said?
- Yes.

1208
01:51:49,756 --> 01:51:51,509
- So he turned his head?
- Yes.

1209
01:51:51,634 --> 01:51:55,343
That means he wasn't deaf. He
was pretending to be. That's the truth!

1210
01:51:55,554 --> 01:51:56,748
Of course!

1211
01:51:56,847 --> 01:51:59,315
And so, in answer
to the Public Prosecutor's question

1212
01:51:59,474 --> 01:52:01,704
about whether the count knew
of the affair,

1213
01:52:01,852 --> 01:52:06,004
we must reply without hesitation, yes!

1214
01:52:06,231 --> 01:52:09,348
And why did he keep quiet?
Because he was plotting his revenge.

1215
01:52:09,525 --> 01:52:11,243
His revenge, gentlemen of the jury.

1216
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:14,158
And if the Public Prosecutor
doesn't pretend to be deaf as well,

1217
01:52:14,321 --> 01:52:15,311
it falls to the defence

1218
01:52:15,407 --> 01:52:18,638
to request the reopening
of the investigation and an autopsy.

1219
01:52:18,827 --> 01:52:22,103
AUTOPSY PROVES ACCUSED RIGHT:
THE DECEASED KNEW!

1220
01:52:22,997 --> 01:52:28,276
ROSSl-COLOMBOTTI ACQUITTED
AND CHEERED BY WOMEN

1221
01:52:29,461 --> 01:52:31,531
Three months later,
discharged from the army,

1222
01:52:31,672 --> 01:52:35,062
my wife and I moved to Milan
where, with Uncle Monsignor's help,

1223
01:52:35,259 --> 01:52:40,175
I got a reference from the Church
for a position at Enricone SpA,

1224
01:52:40,431 --> 01:52:44,470
a vast industrial complex
with about 3,000 employees.

1225
01:52:44,685 --> 01:52:46,243
Of course, Mum.

1226
01:52:46,353 --> 01:52:48,469
Everything's going really well here.

1227
01:52:48,605 --> 01:52:50,482
Tell Dad and my uncle too.

1228
01:52:50,607 --> 01:52:52,245
It's a big city.

1229
01:52:52,359 --> 01:52:55,669
As they say, life has a completely different
rhythm from back home,

1230
01:52:55,862 --> 01:52:58,012
but I'm getting used to it.

1231
01:52:58,990 --> 01:53:02,426
At midday I always go to meet Andrea
at the factory.

1232
01:53:02,618 --> 01:53:04,769
Andrea's very well regarded, Mum.

1233
01:53:04,913 --> 01:53:06,790
They call him the Colonel.

1234
01:53:06,915 --> 01:53:09,588
Yes, yes, double.

1235
01:53:09,751 --> 01:53:10,979
Andrea?

1236
01:53:11,085 --> 01:53:13,360
Andrea, what are you doing?

1237
01:53:13,504 --> 01:53:16,576
- Andrea?
- Yes, darling, I'm coming.

1238
01:53:16,757 --> 01:53:18,873
Sorry, Mum, but Andrea's working.

1239
01:53:19,009 --> 01:53:22,922
I assure you he's perfect. He'd make
the most demanding of wives happy.

1240
01:53:23,138 --> 01:53:24,491
No, Mum.

1241
01:53:24,598 --> 01:53:27,671
Andrea doesn't need
to take any risks to love me.

1242
01:53:27,852 --> 01:53:31,162
No, the past is dead and buried.

1243
01:53:31,355 --> 01:53:36,509
Every man gets to the point where
he wants a proper, ordered life.

1244
01:53:38,070 --> 01:53:40,584
Andrea says goodbye again, Mum.

1245
01:53:40,739 --> 01:53:44,209
Sometimes he has to work in the evening,
you know.

1246
01:53:44,409 --> 01:53:48,163
OK, bye, Mummy. Bye. Bye.

1247
01:53:48,371 --> 01:53:50,931
Bye, Mummy. Yes. Lots of kisses.

1248
01:53:51,082 --> 01:53:53,472
Yes. More kisses. Bye, Mummy. Bye.

1249
01:54:10,893 --> 01:54:14,249
Andrea, come to bed.

1250
01:54:14,438 --> 01:54:16,828
Yes, darling. I'm coming.

1251
01:54:51,015 --> 01:54:53,609
Oh, God! Oh, God! Who's there?

1252
01:54:53,768 --> 01:54:55,759
Andrea, what are you doing?

1253
01:55:00,691 --> 01:55:03,569
THE END
