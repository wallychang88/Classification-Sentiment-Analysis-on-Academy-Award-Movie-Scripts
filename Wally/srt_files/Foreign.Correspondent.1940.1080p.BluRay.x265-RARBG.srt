1
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,367
- What's new?
- Same old daily bunkeroo.

2
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:02,580
Mr. Powers says he wants to see
that foreign stuff as soon as it comes in.

3
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:08,544
Don't declare war
for a few minutes.

4
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,478
"According to a high official,
it is believed..."

5
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:26,979
Bah!

6
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,315
Foreign correspondent!

7
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,819
I could get more news out of Europe
looking in a crystal ball.

8
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:35,905
That, uh, Stebbins cable
has a morsel in it.

9
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:39,116
Stebbins makes me sick.
They all make me sick.

10
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:43,079
Europe about to blow up, and all
I can get out of my foreign staff...

11
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,122
is a daily guessing game.

12
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:49,168
- I want some facts, Mr. Bradley!
- For instance?

13
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,295
Any kind of facts.

14
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,841
There must be something going on
in Europe beside a nervous breakdown.

15
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:58,052
Why not try sending me over,
Mr. Powers?

16
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,557
You've written a book
on economics or something...

17
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,433
The Twilight of Feudalism.

18
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,519
Yes.
It was very well received.

19
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,813
Not by me. I don't want
any more economists...

20
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,732
sages or oracles
bombinating over our cables.

21
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:14,569
I want a reporter, somebody
who doesn't know the difference...

22
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,362
between an "ism"
and a kangaroo.

23
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,740
A good, honest crime reporter...
that's what the Globe needs.

24
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,450
That's what Europe needs.

25
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:24,704
There's a crime hatching
on that bedeviled continent.

26
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,081
Wait a minute.

27
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,792
I've got something
that might pass for an idea.

28
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:35,172
Who was that fellow that ran down
the payroll robbery last week?

29
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,841
Oh, you mean Johnny Jones.

30
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,594
He beat up a policeman,
didn't he, in the line of duty?

31
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,221
Yes, there's talk
at the City desk of firing him.

32
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,141
Hmm.
Beat up a policeman, eh?

33
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,394
Sounds ideal for Europe.

34
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,440
Send Mr. Jones up here
right away.

35
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,484
Mr. Powers wants to see you,
Mr. Jones.

36
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:58,237
- He does, huh?
- You should come right away.

37
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,365
- What about?
- I ain't in his confidence.

38
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,243
Tell him to save his breath.
Tell him I've resigned.

39
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,163
- I'm supposed to bring you there.
- Okay.

40
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:12,793
Wait till I open this.

41
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,339
Where's Mr. Jones?
I told you to send him right up here!

42
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,846
- Are you Mr. Jones?
- Yes.

43
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,390
Sit down, please.

44
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,018
Oh. You mind
a personal question?

45
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,312
- No.
- Are you married?

46
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,522
- No luck.
- Single, eh?

47
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,525
- Ever been in Europe?
- No.

48
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,447
What's your opinion of the present
European crisis, Mr. Jones?

49
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,324
What crisis?

50
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,662
I'm referring
to the impending war.

51
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:52,041
Oh, that. To tell you the truth,
Mr. Powers, I haven't given it
much thought.

52
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,835
You don't keep up
with our foreign news, do you?

53
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:58,339
Mr. Powers, if you're gonna fire me,
you can scrap the intelligence test.

54
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:02,218
It's okay with me. I can get a job
on any other newspaper in town.

55
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,636
- So long.
- Wait a minute.

56
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,805
- Nobody fired you.
- Huh?

57
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:09,016
How would you like to cover
the biggest story in the world today?

58
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:13,020
- Give me an expense account,
and I'll cover anything.
- I'll give you an expense account.

59
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,939
- Okay, what's the story?
- Europe.

60
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:18,317
I'm not exactly equipped,
but I could do some reading up.

61
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,653
No, I like you
just as you are.

62
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,197
What Europe needs
is a fresh, unused mind.

63
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,909
- Foreign correspondent, huh?
- No. Reporter.

64
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:32,081
I don't want correspondence.
I want news.

65
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,709
Think you could dig up
some news in Europe?

66
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,837
- I'd be very happy to try, sir.
- This is what I mean.

67
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,881
Mr. Van Meer, when questioned
by our oracle, Mr. Stebbins...

68
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,925
refused to open his mouth.

69
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,428
Twelve hundred words
cable-tolled to the fact that...

70
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,763
the great Van Meer
had nothing to say.

71
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:51,684
You know what that stuff is doing?
Driving our readers crazy
with frustration.

72
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,602
Who's Van Meer?

73
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,604
Keynote to the European
situation today.

74
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:58,107
Listen, Jones.
If Van Meer stays at the helm...

75
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,526
of his country's affairs
for the next three months...

76
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,445
it may mean
peace in Europe.

77
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,698
If we knew what he was thinking,
we'd know where Europe stands.

78
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,992
- A German, huh?
- No. Holland's strongman.

79
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,911
One of two signers
of the Dutch treaty with the Belgians.

80
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,830
Now, this is
your first assignment.

81
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,624
Talk with him,
find out what's in that treaty...

82
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:18,044
and what he thinks
is going to happen... facts.

83
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,004
- Van Meer, huh?
- Right.

84
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,756
- Anybody else?
- No.

85
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:26,302
How about Hitler? Don't you think
it'd be good to pump him?
He must have something on his mind.

86
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,850
- Yes?
- Mr. Stephen Fisher
to see you, Mr. Powers.

87
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:36,187
Tell him to come in.
Did you ever hear of Stephen Fisher?

88
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:39,315
- I'm afraid he's not on my beat.
- He is from now on.

89
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:42,318
He's head of the Universal Peace Party,
and very close to Van Meer.

90
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:45,154
They're both working to prevent
Europe going up in flames.

91
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,697
Oh.

92
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,283
- How do you do, Mr. Fisher?
- How are you?

93
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,994
- Nice of you to come over. Sit down.
- Thank you.

94
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,872
Mr. Fisher, Mr. Jones,
our new foreign correspondent.

95
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:58,000
- I want you to know each other.
- How do you do?

96
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,794
"Jones"...
I don't like that name.

97
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,129
It's going to handicap you,
young man.

98
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,340
Now, wait a minute.

99
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,675
I've got some sort
of a name here.

100
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,679
Yes. "Haverstock."
"Huntley Haverstock."

101
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:14,433
- Sounds more important,
don't you think?
- Oh, yes. Very dashing too.

102
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,978
- It sounds better than
Richard Harding Davis.
- What's the matter with that?

103
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,814
We can't use that.

104
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,400
That's the name of one of our greatest
war correspondents 40 years ago.

105
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:26,695
Speak up, young man.
You don't mind being
Huntley Haverstock, do you?

106
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,489
A rose by any name, sir.

107
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:32,326
It's exciting being present
at the christening of an American
newspaper correspondent.

108
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,537
Shouldn't we break a bottle
of champagne over him?

109
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:39,375
Break one over my head
to see if I'm still awake.
"Huntley Haverstock."

110
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,544
Well, Mr. Haverstock,
you'd better get started.

111
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,004
You've got a lot to do...
passports, photos, visas...

112
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,382
- Expenses.
- I'll send a note to the cashier.

113
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,551
I hope you brought
your Sunday articles over.

114
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,719
I managed three of them.

115
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:54,390
- See you in London, Mr. Haverstock.
- Yes, of course.

116
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,809
Thank you, Mr. Powers.
Thank you for everything.

117
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,395
Except Huntley Haverstock.

118
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,081
Get a load of this, Mother.

119
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,958
How's it look? Chic?

120
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,295
Don't wear it over one eye.
It makes you look like a gangster.

121
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:28,591
You always think boys are
wearing their hats over one eye.
Let him wear it the way it is.

122
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:32,094
He'll have to wear a stovepipe
when he gets to London.
They call 'em poppers.

123
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,098
- Toppers, Uncle Bjorn.
- Bobby, put that in the box
for Uncle John.

124
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:39,059
- Let me try it on.
- No, I'm going to first.

125
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,604
- Now he's a regular
war correspondent.
- Without a war.

126
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:45,816
- He'll get his war, all right.
- Aw, they're all throwing
a big bluff over there.

127
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,276
Let's hope so.

128
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,696
Mother, how do you like
the way we have our nest furnished?

129
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:54,783
I'd hang lighter curtains, and I'd move
that sofa out in the middle.

130
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,077
It's too bad you haven't
an open fireplace.

131
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,872
If you'd speak to the captain,
he'd tend to everything.

132
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:03,626
All ashore that's going ashore!

133
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,879
All ashore...

134
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,756
Now, Mother.

135
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,128
You're Jones, aren't you? My name's
Stebbins, London man for the Globe.

136
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,715
Yes, Mr. Powers told me
you'd be here. Nice of you to come.

137
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,261
- I lost mine on the way over.
- I can say your other name too...

138
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,429
that Huntley Tavers... feld...

139
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:01,684
I could say it yesterday,
but I had a tough session
with the boys last night.

140
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,062
- I'll stick to Jones, if you don't mind.
- Jones is great with me.

141
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,439
Let's get out of here.
This crowd's making me nervous.

142
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,566
My nerves aren't
in the pink this morning.

143
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,694
You take it easy.
I'll follow you.

144
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,531
- Porter, bring those bags,
and don't bang them into my knees.
- Very good, sir.

145
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,203
What about a drink
after that long train ride?

146
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,205
Sounds like
a very logical idea.

147
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,125
I may not act it,
but I've been here 25 years...

148
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,545
London man for the Globe,
and they haven't caught on to me yet.

149
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:32,840
- How did you manage it?
- You cable back
the government handouts...

150
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,175
and sign 'em
"our London correspondent."

151
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,177
- What's yours?
- Scotch and soda, please.

152
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,722
- Miss? Oh, miss?
- Just a moment, sir.

153
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,892
Oh, miss, please...

154
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,186
Scotch and soda
and a glass of milk.

155
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,731
- "A glass of milk"?
- I'm on the wagon.

156
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,567
I went to the doctor today
about these jitters...

157
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:55,738
and he said it was the wagon
for a month or a new set of organs.

158
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,781
I can't afford new organs.

159
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,744
If I'd known you were on the wagon,
I could've got along without this...

160
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,704
but as long as it's here...

161
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,581
Good luck.

162
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:11,295
- Good?
- Just like any other scotch and soda.

163
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,339
That's what I thought.

164
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:18,886
Doesn't taste the way it did
when I was a baby.
That's got poison in it.

165
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,263
Speaking of poison,
I got some pills...

166
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,932
Oh, some cables have been
coming over from New York.

167
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,269
They love to cable. Makes them
think you're working for them.

168
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,440
There's an invitation to that lunch
for the Dutchman Van Meer tomorrow.

169
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,317
I guess that's your dish.

170
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:36,945
This is given by
the Universal Peace Party.
That's Fisher's organization, isn't it?

171
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,615
I don't know. I don't follow
those things very much.

172
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:43,660
New York wants it, I send it.
That's the secret
of being a correspondent.

173
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,580
Been doing it 25 years.

174
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,333
Twenty-five years,
and I end up on milk.

175
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,983
- Good morning.
How's the water wagon?
- Look at that.

176
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,277
One of them shook off
this morning.

177
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,324
Oh... well, I'm just on my way
to the Van Meer luncheon.

178
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,786
I've got to have lunch here
with old man Clark.
He's the international...

179
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:29,206
Here you are.
I didn't know whether
to meet you in the grill or upstairs.

180
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,875
Hmm.
Good-bye, Stebbins.

181
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,211
Good-bye,
Miss, uh, Clark.

182
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:37,423
Who is he calling "Clark"?
He's got his nerve.

183
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,758
Oh, some fresh
American reporter.

184
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,344
Good morning, Mr. Van Meer.

185
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:49,268
I beg your pardon, sir.
You are Mr. Van Meer, aren't you?

186
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,978
That's my name, yes.

187
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,647
My name's Haverstock.
You don't know me. I'm an American.

188
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,567
- I happened to be on my way
to your luncheon.
- Ah?

189
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,111
- Then perhaps...
- That's very kind of you, sir...

190
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:03,031
Come. Come, come.
It's all in a good cause.

191
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,117
Savoy Hotel.

192
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:14,543
- This is very kind of you, Mr. Van Meer.
- It's a pleasure, my boy.

193
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,962
I dislike riding alone.

194
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,506
One thinks too much
while riding alone.

195
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,884
Yes, exactly.
The Polish situation...

196
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,762
and the Dutch treaty with the Belgians
must be on your mind these days.

197
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,724
What do you feel England
will do in case the Nazis...

198
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:31,393
England
is so beautiful, hmm?

199
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,938
It's nice to see London
in the sunshine.

200
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,734
Always there is lots
of rain or fog.

201
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,694
Also, it is August.

202
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,864
Yes, I found out it was August.
That was good for me.

203
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,325
But would you mind
telling me how you feel...

204
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,410
about Mr. Fisher
and his peace organization?

205
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,412
You know Mr. Fisher?

206
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,915
Oh, a very fine man.

207
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:57,252
A good man. I wish there were more
like him in the world just now.

208
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,881
Then I take it you don't think
there's much hope for peace.

209
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,009
I mean, you don't think
one little peace organization...

210
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,470
can make much headway
against the European war panic.

211
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:10,766
I would like to think so.
Oh, look at those birds.

212
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:14,853
No matter how big the city,
there must always be parks...

213
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,814
and places
for the birds to live.

214
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,275
I was walking through the park
this morning...

215
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,612
and I saw several people
feeding the birds.

216
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:27,491
That's a good sign
at a time like this, is it not?

217
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,117
Yes, it's a dandy sign...

218
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,871
but I think right now the birds
are the least of our problems.

219
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,457
Your country, for instance...
what might be its attitude...

220
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,584
Oh, we're now
near the Savoy.

221
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,674
How much?

222
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,927
A shilling.

223
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,637
That's fine.

224
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,644
By the way, young man...

225
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,564
what newspaper
do you represent?

226
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,567
As a matter of fact,
I'm not exactly a reporter...

227
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:05,654
but I was trying to get you to talk,
and I didn't want bird talk either.

228
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,614
I gathered that.

229
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,577
Just what was it you were
trying to get me to tell you?

230
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:16,123
I was trying to find out what you know
about the possibility of a general war.

231
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,083
How do you really feel
about it?

232
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:21,753
My boy,
I feel very old and sad...

233
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,840
and helpless.

234
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,187
Well, I did have one.

235
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,932
The last news from Poland
was very alarming.

236
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:19,102
- Nobody wants war, and yet...
- Then we don't have to have it.

237
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,272
Miss Fisher, often circumstances
over which we have no control...

238
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,817
Yes, those very convenient circumstances
over which we have no control.

239
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,445
It always seems odd,
but they usually bring on war.

240
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,448
You never hear of circumstances
over which we have no control...

241
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,367
rushing us into peace,
do you?

242
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,410
Very determined woman,
my daughter.

243
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:39,206
Let's go and see if you can pick a fight
somewhere else. Excuse us.

244
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,083
- Good for you.
- Wasn't he a bore?

245
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,251
Many worthy people are.
How do you do?

246
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:46,004
How would you like to be fishing
in Ireland at this minute?

247
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,965
We haven't had a good sail
or swim together in months.

248
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,093
Not even a game of cribbage.
Miss them?

249
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,095
Up anchor, mate.
There's the admiral.

250
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,889
He has a weakness for you.
Go do your stuff.

251
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,517
Ah, here you are... the Jones
that became a Haverstock.

252
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:01,770
Have a good trip? I still wish
you were Richard Harding Davis.

253
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,106
- So do I, sir. Anything except...
- Hello.

254
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,275
Hello. Meet Mrs. Appleby.
This is Huntley Haverstock...

255
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,277
special correspondent,
New York Globe.

256
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,321
- Foreign correspondent? Not really?
- Cross my heart.

257
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:15,117
You look such a sweet boy.
You don't seem like the others...
you know, greasy.

258
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,494
- No?
- But I'm sure you're marvelous at it.

259
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,996
I wonder if you know a friend,
Monty Rockingham.

260
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,998
He's in the embassy
at Istanbul.

261
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,792
Or is it Honolulu?

262
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,461
Do help me with this
distinguished-looking gentleman
over here.

263
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:30,298
I can't make any headway
with him, but I'm sure
he must speak some language.

264
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,968
Everybody does.
I haven't the least idea who he is...

265
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,846
but there isn't anybody here
who isn't internationally important.

266
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,140
This is Mr. Haver...
- Uh, Stock.

267
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,481
No English?

268
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,401
Vous parlez français?

269
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,695
- Try German.
- Sprechen Sie Deutsch?

270
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,156
Splendid.
What else do you know?

271
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,366
- Well, only pig latin.
- Pig la...

272
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,660
Oh. Here we are.

273
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,871
This'll do it.

274
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,873
Ah.

275
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,333
Now we're getting somewhere.
The universal language.

276
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,169
Dear Maharaja.

277
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:16,511
Ah.

278
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,224
Well, they come in pairs.

279
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,645
If you speak English, will you give me
a hand with the laughing Latvian?
What's he talking?

280
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,899
- Latvian.
- No kidding? I didn't know
the Lats had a language.

281
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,276
I thought they just
rubbed noses.

282
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,155
You mean,
you actually speak Latvian?

283
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,199
Oh, just enough to get about.

284
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,327
What does "just enough
to get about" consist of in Latvia?

285
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,662
Well, I don't think
you'd have any trouble.

286
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,207
That'll be a comfort
when I get to Latvia.

287
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,751
You think
there might be a chance soon?

288
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,711
You never can tell
in my racket.

289
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:53,173
- I suppose you've guessed
I'm a foreign correspondent.
- Are you? That's nice.

290
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,470
I see you're taking notes.
Are you covering this affair too?

291
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,097
- I sort of work here.
- Oh, publicity!

292
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:03,099
You're just the one
I'm looking for.

293
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:05,519
We've got to go
in a secret conference right away.

294
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:06,853
Oh.

295
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,730
Uh...

296
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,526
Me? Excuse me.

297
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,529
I beg your pardon,
but I have a Latvian friend here...

298
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,989
who's particularly interested
in the origin of the kilt.

299
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,827
I wonder if you'd be interested
in talking to him.
He's a lovely fellow.

300
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:25,205
It's a most amazing story.
You see...

301
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,542
the Greeks, in the early period,
they used to wear a kilt.

302
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,586
What is this big secret
conference all about?

303
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,713
It's no secret
as far as I'm concerned.

304
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,591
However, I'll let you in
on that part later.

305
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,052
But since you're handling
the publicity for this outfit...

306
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:43,265
you might give me a line
on what it's about... this League
for Peace and Understanding.

307
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,267
What is it
you'd like to know?

308
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,311
First, is this Mr. Fisher
entirely on the level?

309
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,773
- Very much so.
- He seems like a very nice guy.

310
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,608
He is, I assure you.

311
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,403
Well, what is it that
makes him, or you, think...

312
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,447
that an organization like this,
made up of well-meaning amateurs...

313
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,908
buck up against those tough
military boys of Europe?

314
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,244
It's the "well-meaning amateurs,"
as you call them...

315
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,955
who do the fighting
when the war comes, isn't it?

316
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,541
- Luncheon is served.
- Please don't go yet.

317
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,960
You don't want any
of those dreary chicken patties.

318
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,837
I'm sorry. I must go.

319
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,964
Then sit
at the press table with me.

320
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,134
Nobody listens to the speeches
at the press table. We could talk.

321
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:21,553
- You don't know my name yet.
- Is it necessary?

322
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,180
It is to me.
Don't mind if you hear...

323
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:27,559
it's Huntley Haverstock,
because it's really Jones.

324
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,645
- What's yours?
- Mine's really Smith.

325
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,148
Don't mind if you hear
it's anything else.

326
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,406
- Waiter?
- Yes, sir?

327
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,533
Same young lady.
Try again.

328
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,952
I have taken the young lady
13 notes, sir.

329
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,288
She won't accept any more.

330
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,169
Milords, ladies...

331
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,671
and gentlemen...

332
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,633
pray silence
for your chairman...

333
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,052
Mr. Stephen Fisher.

334
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,681
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have an announcement to make...

335
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,643
which I'm sure will be
a great disappointment to us all.

336
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,187
I've just received this telegram
from Mr. Van Meer...

337
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,815
who was to have been
our guest of honor today.

338
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:19,527
"Deeply regret. Called away suddenly
owing to unforeseen circumstances.

339
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:22,197
I will be unable to attend
your meeting as planned.

340
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:25,075
I am with you and your work
with all my heart.

341
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,786
I could not have said more
had I been there."

342
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,457
Although this removes
one of our star attractions
at the luncheon...

343
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,751
we may have more time
to tell you...

344
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,212
from the inside
what this party has stood for...

345
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,965
and why we've asked you
here today.

346
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:42,926
I can think of no one
more competent to do this...

347
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,345
than the speaker
I am about to introduce.

348
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,889
I trust you will not think
this is a family affair...

349
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,016
when I say
I refer to my daughter...

350
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,019
Miss Carol Fisher.

351
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:01,069
Milords...

352
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,863
ladies and gentlemen...

353
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,574
pray silence
for Miss Carol Fisher.

354
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:17,585
Ladies and gentlemen...

355
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:21,798
I trust that, even making allowances
for a father's exuberance...

356
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:25,427
you do not think I'm in any way
being put forward today...

357
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,721
as a substitute
for Mr. Van Meer.

358
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:32,058
Unhappily for us, no one
can take Mr. Van Meer's place.

359
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,270
What I can do, possibly, is
to clear up a few misapprehensions...

360
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:38,523
that seem to have crept
into the public discussion
of this movement...

361
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,693
and revise some
of the epithets applied to us...

362
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:45,780
by some who have not gone
as deeply into the matter
as they might.

363
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,700
- The female of the "speeches"
is deadlier than the male.
- Shh!

364
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,952
...as a group
of well-meaning amateurs.

365
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:54,581
I'm sure there are some of you here
who think of us as such.

366
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:58,543
I should like to ask anyone who has
called us "well-meaning amateurs"...

367
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,463
to stand up by his chair
and tell me just why...

368
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:04,049
a well-meaning amateur
is any less reliable...

369
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:06,676
than a well-meaning professional
at a moment like this...

370
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,511
but I'll not take the time.

371
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,931
I think the world
has been run long enough
by the well-meaning professional.

372
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,100
We might give
the amateurs their chance now.

373
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,854
But what I really want to do
is give you a brief idea of...

374
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,565
just... -

375
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:25,320
just how far-reaching
our amateur plans are.

376
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,658
Use your notes.

377
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:33,495
And, uh, just...

378
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,497
why we ask for your support...

379
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,874
professional or amateur.

380
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,751
What I mean is that...

381
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,837
however much one may...

382
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,509
I mean,
we should both...

383
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,262
both of us...

384
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:16,890
Better to wait in there.

385
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,269
- Mr. Fisher, how are you?
- When did you get over?

386
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:24,939
Just now.
I had a cable from Mr. Powers.
This is my first assignment.

387
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:28,776
Rather ironic assignment:
A peace conference
in the shadow of war.

388
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:32,405
- You mean it's really coming?
- Today and tomorrow will tell.
There's still hope.

389
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,116
- I'm going back to London today.
- Leaving for London?

390
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,785
I only just got here.
The conference is just beginning.

391
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:41,581
Today and tomorrow,
the work of peace must be done
in London rather than Amsterdam.

392
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:45,585
Are you taking your whole staff
to London with you, including your...

393
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:49,297
No, someone staying here will see
you're given all the help you need.

394
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,799
You'll be in very good hands.
Here she is.

395
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,678
- Mrs. Appleby, Mr. Haverstock.
- We met at the luncheon.

396
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,639
You remember
Mr. , don't you?

397
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,849
He's nice,
but I still can't understand him.

398
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:03,269
Dr. Williamson,
Mr. Huntley Haverstock
represents the New York Globe.

399
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,105
He's unfamiliar with Amsterdam
and the machinery of peace meetings.

400
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,608
Would you take him
under your wing?

401
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:13,029
Perhaps you and Mrs. Appleby
might see he samples eight or ten
varieties of Dutch cheese tonight.

402
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,948
Now I must see
what unlucky person...

403
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:18,117
is going to give up his seat
to me on that plane.

404
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,536
Don't get into any mischief,
will you?

405
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:23,164
- "Mischief"?
- Your first visit to Amsterdam?

406
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,417
- Yes.
- You must let me take you
to Rembrandt's house...

407
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:30,338
It might be a good idea
if we went over the agenda
of the conference.

408
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,966
If you'll excuse me,
I see a friend.

409
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,355
Mr. Van Meer, how are you?

410
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:50,358
We seemed to lose each other
the day before yesterday.

411
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:52,819
I'm so sorry
you were called away.

412
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,737
Don't you remember me?

413
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,491
We shared the same cab
on the way to the luncheon.

414
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,494
Excuse me. May I have
your picture, Mr. Van Meer?

415
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,079
Thank you.

416
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:18,970
There he goes!

417
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,860
Follow that car! Quick!

418
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,742
Oh.

419
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,370
- You better get out of here.
- Don't be silly. Drive on.

420
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,792
- Who's he shot?
- Van Meer. Assassinated.

421
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,377
- Dead?
- Looked like it.

422
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:35,213
- Bad show.
- Couldn't be much worse,
from his point of view.

423
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,636
Do you mind shoving
your knees out of the way?

424
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,409
You'd better hop
in the back, old girl.

425
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:06,160
Hurry.

426
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,377
Safety glass.
I wonder whose make.

427
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,130
- Good chauffeur
you've got, Miss Fisher.
- Yes, isn't he?

428
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,840
- You two know each other?
- Yeah.

429
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,634
I forgot. This is Scott ffolliott.
Newspaperman, same as you.

430
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,219
Roaming correspondent.

431
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,221
- Mr. Haverstock, Mr. Ffolliott.
- With a double F.

432
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,348
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

433
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:30,685
- I don't get the double F.
- At the beginning. Both small Fs.

434
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:34,981
- It can't be at the beginning.
- One of my ancestors had his head
chopped off by Henry VIII.

435
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,775
His wife dropped the capital letter
to commemorate the occasion.

436
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,360
There it is.

437
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:44,365
- How do you say it? Like a stutter?
- No, just straight "fuh."

438
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:08,055
- It's stopped raining.
The sun's coming out.
- The police are coming.

439
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:37,084
That's the most amazing
disappearing trick I've ever seen.

440
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:43,424
Don't suppose they could've
got up that high, do you?

441
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,773
Vanished.

442
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:03,361
Take a look for yourself,
old boy.

443
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,863
Tell him your name,
about the two small Fs.

444
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,533
That would be a bit over his head.

445
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,497
Well, this isn't catching
any assassins.

446
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:18,626
- We should've kept one of those
policemen and played bridge.
- I guess you're right.

447
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,129
Oh!

448
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:26,133
I'll bet 2 to 1 on the derby.

449
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,994
Look at those sails
on that windmill.

450
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,913
You'll get used to those
when you've been in Holland longer.

451
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,668
I could've sworn
they were going against the wind.

452
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:03,629
Why don't you lie down
on the grass and cool off?

453
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,258
In due time, but first I want you
to get the police back here.

454
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:10,928
- The police again?
- We don't want the police.
I've decided not to prosecute.

455
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,847
You'll get the police,
'cause our man's in there.

456
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:14,223
- Where?
- In that mill.

457
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,852
- What makes you think so?
- A lot can happen while I'm explaining.

458
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,105
Please get the police.
I'd go if I spoke the language.

459
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,065
- What'll you do?
- A bit of snooping.

460
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,484
I hate to seem executive,
but this is serious.

461
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,237
- Come on, Scott.
- All right. You shall have your police.

462
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,976
It's a signal.
It's a signal for that plane to land.

463
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:37,593
Oh.

464
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,346
Ah, come in...

465
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,932
and close the door, mister.

466
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:47,728
Mr. Van Meer.
It isn't possible.

467
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,942
I've just been given a drug...

468
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,944
drug of some sort.

469
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,739
But I saw you shot just now
outside the conference hall! I saw it!

470
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:02,076
They gave it to me...

471
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:04,411
when they moved me from...

472
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:08,040
Ah, it's beginning now. I...

473
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,376
The man I saw shot
was a dead image!

474
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,837
The man you saw shot...

475
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:15,047
that wasn't me.

476
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,550
He was a subs...

477
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,511
substitute
that looked like me.

478
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:22,054
But why? What...

479
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:26,559
They... They want
the world to think...

480
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,770
that I've been assassinated.

481
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,438
Yes.

482
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,733
To conceal the fact...

483
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,652
that I am in their hands.

484
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:39,363
"Their hands"?
Who are "they"?

485
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:43,158
I can't explain.

486
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:46,370
I'm not cert...

487
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:48,289
This drug...

488
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,666
I can hardly think.

489
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:55,337
All I can tell you is that...

490
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:59,133
they are going
to take me away by plane...

491
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,220
like a bird.

492
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,557
Always are places
in the city...

493
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:10,019
where birds can get crumbs.

494
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,733
Birds. Cru...

495
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,318
Oh, quickly.

496
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,779
A pencil.

497
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:10,759
You see? Old mill.

498
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,595
Up the road.

499
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,722
Look.

500
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:17,432
Man.

501
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,727
Old mill. Understand?

502
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:22,729
Does anyone here
speak English?

503
00:41:22,856 --> 00:41:25,232
English? We speak English
in the school.

504
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,569
Why have you been
holding out on me?
Tell these two policemen...

505
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:30,404
to come with me.

506
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:33,740
Very, very important.
Big old prisoner. Old mill.

507
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:36,410
Tell them to follow me.
Do you understand?

508
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,459
Yeah.

509
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:54,094
Yeah. That's what I've been
trying to tell you. Come on.

510
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,075
They've gone.

511
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:31,840
They've killed him.

512
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,432
But it isn't...

513
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,309
Who are you?

514
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,812
Where are the others?

515
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:53,904
There's been a frame-up.
Ask him where the others have gone.

516
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:05,040
He says he doesn't know
what you're talking about.
There are no other people.

517
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,125
He's been asleep here all day.

518
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:10,295
He's lying. I talked
to Van Meer in this very room.

519
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,722
Well, there's one thing
I can show you...

520
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,975
the assassin's car,
the one we followed.

521
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:34,152
A unique specimen, old boy.
The only one-horse sports car
in the world.

522
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:37,698
That car was here!
Listen, I know I look a fool...

523
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:40,033
but there's something fishy
going on around here.

524
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,703
There's a big story in this.
I can smell it...

525
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,706
and I'm going to get
to the bottom of it.

526
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:48,000
And nothing's gonna stop me,
do you understand?

527
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:52,170
I'm going to prove that that was not
Van Meer that was assassinated
but his double.

528
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:14,276
Who is it?

529
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:18,822
All right, come in.

530
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,956
- Mr. Haverstock?
- Yes.

531
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,375
What are you, the house detective?
You weren't announced.

532
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,753
I'm sorry, sir.
We asked at the desk.

533
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,089
Policemen, huh?
Don't tell me you're here
to apologize about the windmill.

534
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:38,717
No, sir. We simply want you
to come with us...

535
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,094
and tell your story
to our chief of police.

536
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:44,264
Does this chief of police
speak English?
I'm a very busy man.

537
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,934
It will take no more
than half an hour, sir.
We all speak English.

538
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,896
That's marvelous.
That's more than I can say
for my country.

539
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:53,815
Would you sit down?
I have to make a phone call.

540
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,942
Dinner date
with a young lady.

541
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:14,211
The exchange doesn't answer.
Well, I'll call later.

542
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:17,130
Look, I'm a very quick bather.
Would you excuse me...

543
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:20,008
while I jump in the tub
and give myself a shave?

544
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,260
Look at some magazines.
I'll be right back.

545
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:26,348
- You couldn't bring the chief
of police here, could you?
- No, I am afraid not.

546
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:28,183
No, I thought not.

547
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,884
- Please don't bother to come.
- You'll find it on my dressing table.

548
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,401
Well, we meet again.

549
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,278
So it seems.

550
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:06,156
Quite a lot's happened
since I last saw you.

551
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:08,575
- So I see.
- Uh...

552
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:12,496
I, uh, had quite a chase
after that guy outside Amsterdam.

553
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:15,332
It's quite a country.
It's interesting. Windmills and tulips.

554
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,417
Did you find
everything you...

555
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:23,590
We were just talking about the tulips.
Don't seem to be any.

556
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:25,967
I really think
I should be going now.

557
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,221
Thank you very much
for the powder.

558
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:31,598
Oh, must you really go now?

559
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,350
Yes, I must be going now.

560
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:35,685
Really.

561
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:39,648
Good-bye.

562
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,615
- You've made quite
a day of it, haven't you?
- Shh! Listen...

563
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:51,576
Made monkeys out of ffolliott and me,
broken into my bedroom...

564
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,079
and disgraced me
before a friend of my father's.

565
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,872
What are your plans now?

566
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,458
- You might at least
have had your clothes on.
- Take it easy.

567
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,753
- This is serious business.
- I've seen your "serious business" before.

568
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,713
- What are you doing?
- Escaping.

569
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,925
- From what?
- A couple fellows in my room
about to kill me.

570
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:11,054
- May I ask who?
- Two gentlemen disguised as policemen
waiting to take me for a ride.

571
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,683
- Don't you think you've been talking
through your hat long enough?
- I'm not!

572
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:17,477
I've thrown a monkey wrench
into some international dirty business.

573
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:20,855
I know Van Meer's alive.
That's the reason they want to kill me.

574
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:23,275
- I can think of others.
- You've got to help me...

575
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:26,319
not for my sake, but this is
the biggest story in Europe.

576
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:31,032
- Your childish mind is as out of place
in Europe as you are in my bedroom.

577
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,784
Get over there.

578
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:39,666
Ah.

579
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,428
You see what you're doing,
don't you?

580
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:54,848
This is going straight back to London.
We'll be common gossip by tomorrow.

581
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:58,059
I don't care for myself,
but my father's engaged in great work.

582
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:02,314
He's trying to help avert a dreadful war.
This is just the thing to discredit him.

583
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,442
I know you care nothing
about our work.
All you're interested in...

584
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:07,569
is having fun with windmills
and hotel bathrooms.

585
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:09,446
You don't believe
I'm in trouble.

586
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:13,950
You'll be in plenty of trouble
if you don't get out.
For the last time, please go.

587
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:22,042
Okay, but I want you to know exactly
what's going to happen when I do go.

588
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:26,546
I'll go back to my room
and try to shake those fellows off,
but I won't succeed.

589
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:30,175
They'll stick to me like a couple
of tattoo marks until they get me.

590
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:33,678
They'll stop at nothing.
I seem to know too much,
and they're right.

591
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,473
I don't know the ins and outs
of your crackpot movement...

592
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:39,643
and what's wrong with Europe,
but I do know a story...

593
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:43,396
and I'll keep after it
until either I get it or it gets me.

594
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:46,024
Sorry you have those
derogatory opinions of me...

595
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:48,318
but I guess
that can't be helped.

596
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:51,613
Well, so long.

597
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:54,407
It's been nice knowing you.

598
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:58,078
I said "good-bye."

599
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:06,086
Don't go.

600
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:12,926
Oh, I guess I could've handled
those fellows all right, with luck.

601
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:15,303
We mustn't take chances.
We should get some help.

602
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,472
That's what I had
in mind at first.

603
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:19,557
I'll get Dr. Williamson
and Mr. Van...

604
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:22,227
Not with me this way.
They might not understand.

605
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,270
They have understood.

606
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:34,739
We could catch the boat to England
and see Father if you could get out.

607
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,450
That's the hitch. What's that friend
of yours? F-f something.

608
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:40,954
- Ffolliott.
- Give me Mr. Ffolliott's room, please.

609
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,622
Left the hotel?

610
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:44,833
That's strange.
We were to dine together tonight.

611
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:48,962
- He realized how much I meant to you.
- You'd mean much more
with your clothes on.

612
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:51,923
- You like the intellectual type.
Say, I've got an idea.
- What?

613
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,592
The manager, please.
Buzz for the valet, will you?

614
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,555
Hello, is this the manager?
This is Mr. Haverstock in 537.

615
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:01,307
What kind of a hotel is this?
My bathtub leaks...

616
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:03,685
my phone's out of order,
and I've been robbed.

617
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:06,646
Will you send somebody up
right away? Thank you.

618
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:10,650
Operator,
send a waiter up to 537.

619
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:13,278
And ask the chambermaid
to bring up clean sheets.

620
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:15,155
I've set mine on fire.

621
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:19,409
And I'd like a window-cleaner, and ask
boots to come up and get my shoes.

622
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:21,536
And hurry it up.
That's a good girl.

623
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:25,039
- That'll clutter up that room
for those two guys.

624
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:27,709
It's the valet.
Come in.

625
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:29,252
- Do you speak English?
- Yes, sir.

626
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:32,172
- Go to my room, 537...
- 537.

627
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:35,091
And get me a shirt, tie,
suit, and a hat.

628
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:39,846
You see, my husband's waiting
in the room for this gentleman.

629
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:05,056
No sign of them yet.
Come on, let's hide in the cabin.

630
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,773
- Full up, sir. Sorry.
- Not even a small cabin?

631
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,609
Not a thing.
Everybody in a hurry to get home.

632
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:20,780
I see. I have a rare bank note here
you might be interested in.

633
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,074
That is, if you collect
rare bank notes.

634
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,786
Sir, I'd do it if I could,
but there just isn't a place left.

635
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:30,498
Aboard an English ship you come up
against such an air of incorruptibility.

636
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:33,626
As a matter of fact, sir,
I just had a cabin returned.

637
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:36,254
- Can I have your name, sir?
- Oh.

638
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,424
One cabin isn't going to do us
much good. We just can't...

639
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:43,094
I fully intended to sleep in the lounge.
I hope you didn't think I...

640
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,597
No, of course not.
It's very kind of you.

641
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:47,473
Fine. I'll take it.

642
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,893
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm afraid it's too late now.

643
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:54,355
You seemed to have
some doubt about taking it.
I had to let that gentleman have it.

644
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:57,734
Oh, that's too bad.
It's such a rare five-pound note too.

645
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:00,528
The watermark's upside down.
I think you'd have loved it.

646
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,822
Well, perhaps next time.

647
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,740
Were you really going to tip
that man five pounds?

648
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:48,660
Of course. I charge all
my traveling expenses to the office.

649
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,620
Corrupting an official:
Five pounds.

650
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:53,331
You're just a wee bit
unscrupulous, aren't you?

651
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:55,917
Not unscrupulous.
Just in love.

652
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:59,921
- It's the same thing, I suppose.
- I beg your pardon?

653
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:02,173
I beg yours.

654
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:05,051
You see, I love you
and I want to marry you.

655
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:10,807
I love you,
and I want to marry you.

656
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:15,520
Well, that cuts our love scene down
quite a bit, doesn't it?

657
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:18,898
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.
It's made a new man of me.

658
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:21,567
I hope not entirely new.
It took me some time...

659
00:55:21,694 --> 00:55:24,070
to get used
to the first man you were.

660
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:27,240
To be perfectly frank,
I expected a little more argument.

661
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:30,368
I'm left with quite a few things
I wanted to say.

662
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:33,746
Save them until after we're married.
I imagine they'll sound much better then.

663
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:35,498
I'd saved things to say then too.

664
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:38,668
You were really quite sure
of yourself, weren't you?

665
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:40,837
Funny... I didn't think
I had a chance.

666
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:43,673
- A guy's got a right to dream,
though, hasn't he?
- Evidently.

667
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:46,134
Do you think your father
will understand?

668
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:49,262
I think Father
will be delighted, frankly.

669
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:11,075
Right, sir.

670
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:21,085
- Good morning, Miss Carol.
- Good morning, Stiles.

671
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:24,672
- This is Mr. Haverstock.
Is Father up yet?
- Yes, miss. He's having breakfast.

672
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,466
Come on.

673
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,432
- Hello, Father.
- What are you doing in London?

674
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:36,976
Jo... Mr. Haverstock
brought me back on the boat.

675
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,687
Nothing wrong, is there?
You're not ill? You look healthy.

676
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,314
No, I'm fine.
It's Mr. Haverstock.

677
00:56:41,482 --> 00:56:43,483
I hope you don't mind
my barging in.

678
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:47,445
On the contrary. I'm delighted.
You cover a lot of territory, don't you?

679
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:51,657
You didn't even send a wire.
Just for that, I hope your trip
was perfectly uncomfortable.

680
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,285
It wasn't so bad.
We couldn't get cabins...

681
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,579
but we managed
to sleep on the deck.

682
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,790
Monsieur Krug.
How nice to see you again.

683
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,917
Mr. Haverstock,
Monsieur Krug.

684
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:06,339
Monsieur Krug is a member
of the Borovian Embassy staff here.

685
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:08,508
Sit down.
Have a spot of breakfast.

686
00:57:08,634 --> 00:57:11,135
I know I should tidy up,
but I'm simply starved.

687
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:18,142
So you were in Amsterdam
yesterday, Mr. Haverstock?

688
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,020
Poor Van Meer. I count his death
a heavy personal loss.

689
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,064
Of all people,
why Van Meer?

690
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:26,484
You can't ask "why" of an assassin.
There's no logic in killing.

691
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:29,654
We can't spare such men
in a world like ours.

692
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,406
Did you by any chance meet him,
Mr. Haverstock?

693
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:34,659
Not formally,
but I saw him die.

694
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:37,328
Horrible.

695
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:41,332
As a matter of fact, I chased the man
that shot him and almost caught him.

696
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,669
Mr. Haverstock is a newspaperman,
Monsieur Krug.

697
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:49,173
That would be quite a coup,
bringing in your first story
wrapped around an assassin.

698
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:53,511
I shall have to be
getting along now, Mr. Fisher.

699
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:58,432
Shall we settle on the wording
for the peace petition now or later?

700
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:01,894
We may as well clear it up
in the study. You'll excuse us?

701
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,647
Father, could I speak to you?
It's terribly important.

702
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:08,442
This won't take a moment.
Meanwhile, see if you can't
interest Mr. Haverstock...

703
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:10,778
in some eggs and bacon.

704
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,656
- Mr. Fisher...
What's that man doing here?
- It's Monsieur Krug.

705
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:16,033
- Van Meer isn't dead.
- But I just read...

706
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,202
That was his double.
Van Meer was kidnapped.

707
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:21,873
- I talked to him in a mill
outside Amsterdam.
- What has Krug to do with it?

708
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:25,334
- Remember my description
of the man in the mill?
- You mean the sweater?

709
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,087
Of course! But that's impossible.
We've known Monsieur Krug...

710
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:32,049
Mr. Krug brought Van Meer here
by plane last night.
He's in England. They're hiding him.

711
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:35,761
- Positive about this?
- I was as close to Krug
as I am to you now.

712
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:39,432
- It'd be terrible if we made a mistake.
On the other hand...
- Mr. Fisher.

713
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,601
Leave it to me.

714
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:49,901
I don't want to seem inhospitable,
but I must ask you to leave.

715
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:53,446
Mr. Haverstock is going to suggest
I turn you over to the police.

716
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:56,949
Mr. Haverstock seems to be
something of a troublemaker.

717
00:58:57,075 --> 00:59:00,620
I thought you said
he'd been taken care of
by our agents in Amsterdam.

718
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:02,455
I thought so too.

719
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:04,874
I don't understand it,
unless perhaps...

720
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,419
Miss Fisher's being with him
may have caused complications.

721
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:11,214
It would've been ideal
if she'd been in our confidence.

722
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,216
Leave my daughter out of it.

723
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:16,010
- I beg your pardon.
- Most unfortunate, his coming here.

724
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:19,722
I've never had to cope with this sort
of thing before, thanks to you.

725
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:22,141
Someone has to take care
of the sordid details.

726
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:26,771
But this is close to home.
In fact, it is my home.
After all, I'm only a politician.

727
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:28,689
In a sense.

728
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:32,151
And politicians aren't usually
called upon to, uh...

729
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,487
do away with their guests,
are they?

730
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:36,614
Quiet, boy. Quiet.

731
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,158
Not in the house.
No, sir.

732
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:42,245
But I have an idea.

733
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,670
- Do you remember Rowley?
- Rowley?

734
00:59:50,796 --> 00:59:54,465
Yes, the little man who used to work
at your father's stables in Austria.

735
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:58,719
Yes, I recall he was present
when a mutual friend of ours, um...

736
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:01,597
accidentally fell off
the high bridge at Bern.

737
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,349
He's retired now.

738
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:05,726
Lives somewhere
in Clapham here in London.

739
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,521
If Mr. Haverstock could be
induced to hire him...

740
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:11,232
in the capacity
of a private detective...

741
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:13,567
- What for?
- Well...

742
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:17,446
you should warn him that it is
very dangerous to go about London...

743
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,657
with the knowledge
that he has.

744
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:22,702
Yes, I see. Yes.

745
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:26,205
You use the English language
with great delicacy, Krug.

746
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:29,333
Thank you, sir. I shall look
Mr. Rowley up at once...

747
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,043
and give him his instructions.

748
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:33,879
But you mustn't.
It would be too dangerous.

749
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:40,177
- What do we do? Call Scotland Yard?
- I thought it best
to send Krug on his way.

750
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:42,388
You let him get away?
Well, listen...

751
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:46,392
Don't you see how important it is
not to rouse Krug's suspicions?

752
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,562
- Van Meer will be killed immediately.
- Dead or alive, it's a story.

753
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:51,355
Johnny, Father's right.

754
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,984
- Okay, I'll cable them what I've got.
- I wouldn't if I were you.

755
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:57,987
Van Meer's life may depend
upon our keeping this quiet.

756
01:00:58,113 --> 01:00:59,822
Keep it quiet?

757
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:03,951
A famous diplomat's kidnapped
under my own eyes,
and I muzzle myself?

758
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,871
I'm sorry,
but this is a story with facts...

759
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:10,750
the kind I was sent here to get,
the kind America's waiting for.

760
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:13,669
It'll be bigger if you can wait
just a few hours...

761
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:17,590
until we can find Van Meer
and discover what's behind
this whole curious business.

762
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:20,468
- I know what's behind it.
- I don't mean who's behind it.

763
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:22,595
I mean the why of it.

764
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:26,432
Dear, will you get me
all my correspondence with Krug?

765
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:28,267
Please, Johnny,
do what Father says.

766
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:30,936
It'll be best for you
and poor Mr. Van Meer.

767
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,272
Okay. I'll wait.

768
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:40,321
- I'm worried about you.
- I'm a little worried about myself.
I feel weak-minded.

769
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:43,949
You're doing the right thing,
but I don't like you dashing about
without protection.

770
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:46,869
- Forget it.
- If what you say is true,
you need protection.

771
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:51,624
I've covered beer mob killings
and race riots since I was a tot
without even a rabbit's foot.

772
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:55,586
These people are criminals,
more dangerous than
your rumrunners and housebreakers.

773
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,338
They're fanatics.

774
01:01:57,464 --> 01:02:01,634
They combine a mad love of country
with an equally mad indifference to life...

775
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:04,095
their own as well as others.

776
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:06,806
They're cunning,
unscrupulous...

777
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:09,183
and... inspired.

778
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:14,188
And I really couldn't
face Mr. Powers again...

779
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:18,150
if you didn't live long enough
to turn in the best story of the year.

780
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:21,570
I'm gonna be
a fine foreign correspondent
hiding in an attic somewhere.

781
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:25,324
I'm not suggesting you hide anywhere.
Just get somebody to watch out for you.

782
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:28,285
A nurse? Johnny Jones goes
to Europe and hires a nurse.

783
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:31,038
That's gonna look great
on the expense account.

784
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:35,000
I know a very efficient
private detective agency
where we can get just the man.

785
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,920
- Okay, whatever you say.
- I can arrange it all for you.

786
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,925
If it'll make you feel better,
I won't mention it to anybody.

787
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:46,846
If anyone finds out I've hired
a bodyguard, I'll shoot myself.

788
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,861
- If that's Mr. Rowley,
tell him to wait outside.
- Yes, sir.

789
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:06,699
I've called on Mr. Haverstock.
Will you tell him Mr. Rowley is here?

790
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:08,784
- Will you wait here, please?
- Thank you.

791
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:14,206
- Mr. Haverstock, your cab's here.
- Where are you going?

792
01:03:14,374 --> 01:03:17,376
- To the office. I've got work to do.
- But you mustn't go.

793
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:21,255
I was sent over here at great expense
as a newspaperman, not a refugee.

794
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:24,008
- How about lunch at the Savoy?
- I'll see you out.

795
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:28,220
Johnny,
please be careful.

796
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:29,972
I'll be all right.

797
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:35,853
Mr. Haverstock?

798
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:39,190
Is this the man?
Look, who's protecting who?

799
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:41,692
Well, I ain't lanky, sir,
but I'm quick.

800
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,944
I take it
you understand what to do.

801
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:47,948
You can trust me to take care
of Mr. Haverstock.
Are we going now, sir?

802
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:51,202
Yes, you can take me to my office,
and if you're good...

803
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:53,704
- to the American Club.
- Right, sir.

804
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:57,917
- You'll keep after this other thing?
- As soon as there's news,
I'll let you know.

805
01:03:58,043 --> 01:03:59,835
Then you can break the story.
Good-bye.

806
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,420
Good-bye, sir.

807
01:04:06,927 --> 01:04:08,677
Why, Carol.

808
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:11,764
Nothing must happen to him, Father.
I just couldn't...

809
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:19,522
How do we go, sir?

810
01:04:19,648 --> 01:04:23,192
Would you like me to walk behind you,
or beside you, like a friend?

811
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:26,195
- What's the custom?
- Different people has different tastes.

812
01:04:26,321 --> 01:04:29,406
With the Duke of Albatrorr,
the duke, being a democratic gent...

813
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:32,117
I used to walk alongside of him,
man-to-man, like.

814
01:04:32,244 --> 01:04:35,746
On the other hand, I once had a lady
who thought that was disrespectful.

815
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:38,290
"Three paces behind," she says,
"and don't smoke on duty."

816
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:41,961
- What's good enough for a duke
is good enough for me.
- Thank you, sir.

817
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:47,091
If we want to go to the American Club,
we'd better take a cab. There's one.

818
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:49,552
What's the trouble, sir.
Is it gangsters after you?

819
01:04:49,678 --> 01:04:52,930
- Not exactly.
- We're not afraid
of gangsters over here, sir.

820
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:55,975
- Even our police don't carry guns.
- What do they do?

821
01:04:56,101 --> 01:05:00,145
Hit you over the head with a stick.
A bit more healthy-like.

822
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:08,696
Did you see that?
Someone deliberately pushed me!

823
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:12,324
That was me, sir. If I'd have pulled
you back, you'd have been caught.

824
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:16,328
- It was push or nothing.
- Smart work, Mr. Rowley.
Thank you very much.

825
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:19,498
After all, that's what I'm here for,
isn't it? Taxi!

826
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:26,338
- American Club.
- Yes, sir.

827
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,173
After you, sir.

828
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:39,268
I'm not certain, sir,
but I've got an idea...

829
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:42,521
two men just got
in another cab to follow us.

830
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:44,523
I don't see
anyone suspicious.

831
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,692
Well, I may have
been mistaken...

832
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:49,236
but I'm almost certain
I saw them.

833
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:54,408
They may have heard
where we're going.

834
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:57,703
Driver.

835
01:05:57,829 --> 01:06:00,289
Driver?
Go down Victoria Street...

836
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:02,249
'round past
Buckingham Palace.

837
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,709
Right, sir.

838
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:07,129
We might give 'em the slip
if we go the long way around.

839
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:12,509
I'm afraid
they're still after us.

840
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:16,138
Our best plan is to pull 'round
the next corner and change cabs.

841
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:19,350
Driver? Take the first
to your left and pull up.

842
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,560
We're going to walk a bit.

843
01:06:28,026 --> 01:06:31,320
I'll do it, sir. I understand
the money. It'll be quicker.

844
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:34,073
Thank you, sir.

845
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:38,410
Our best plan is to slip
into the cathedral for a bit.

846
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:42,539
Let's call off this ducking
and let them catch up with us
and have a showdown.

847
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:46,794
- I wouldn't cause a scene.
Our job is to give 'em the slip.
- All right.

848
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:50,673
- Let's go.
- Nice bit of architecture, sir, innit?

849
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:18,450
Do you mind not going right in, sir?

850
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:22,329
I saw by the notice it was
a requiem mass... a mass for the dead.

851
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:26,291
That sort of thing
always depresses me...
praying for the dead and all that.

852
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:28,752
The dead are all right
in their place, sir...

853
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,880
but the music and the candles
always gives me the creeps.

854
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:35,134
It does really, sir.
I don't like to be so fussy...

855
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:41,515
How about
a trip up top, sir?

856
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:44,101
That'd really put 'em
off the scent.

857
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,953
Boys, careful there.

858
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:19,428
- I can't see.
- Eh? Here, here.

859
01:08:19,554 --> 01:08:22,473
There you are, me boy.

860
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:24,349
Ooh!

861
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:26,351
Look, there it goes. There.

862
01:08:26,478 --> 01:08:28,687
I'll have to buy you
another now.

863
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:30,731
Love a duck!

864
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:33,275
Careful, boys.

865
01:08:33,401 --> 01:08:35,527
You better be careful too, sir.

866
01:08:40,992 --> 01:08:42,576
Not yet, boys.

867
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:49,958
Let's get out of here.
I have a luncheon date
and plenty to do before it.

868
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:53,545
I've got it in mind, sir.
Don't you worry. Really, now, look.

869
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:56,215
Isn't it worthwhile
coming up here to see it, sir?

870
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:58,383
There's the houses
of Parliament over there.

871
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:01,804
And there's St. James's Park.
That green patch. Yeah.

872
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:03,680
Come along, boys.

873
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:13,774
You must excuse me getting so scared
when you leaned over just now, sir.

874
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,735
I was once with a man
on a bridge in Switzerland.

875
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:18,987
He had a very nasty fall.

876
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:23,158
Killed him. Stone dead.

877
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:26,954
Always made me
a bit nervous since.

878
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:46,265
Don't go down just yet, sir.
I'd like you to see St. Paul's.

879
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:48,809
There it is,
just coming out of the mist.

880
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:52,145
Oh, and look. There's the 'orse guards
approaching Buckingham Palace.

881
01:09:52,272 --> 01:09:55,774
- See 'em? Down there.
- It makes the backs of me legs go funny.

882
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:58,485
Height always did.
Let's get down again, Eric.

883
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,404
Why didn't you say so before?

884
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,447
Miss,
I know just how you feel.

885
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:06,410
Them as has
no head for heights can't help it.
Nobody ought not to blame them.

886
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:09,788
- What's it got to do with you?
- All right, keep your head on.

887
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:12,374
- I was only sympathizing.
- I'm going down anyway.

888
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,543
- Wait for the lift.
- No.

889
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,593
No stairs for me.
I'm gonna take the elevator.

890
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,344
Wait a minute, sir.

891
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:28,307
You ain't seen
the 'orse guards yet.

892
01:10:28,433 --> 01:10:30,684
You must see
the 'orse guards, sir.

893
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:34,062
Where?
I don't see anything.

894
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:36,398
Why, there they are, sir.

895
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:38,483
Down the road.

896
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:41,570
Just going toward the...

897
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:43,488
the white building.

898
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:57,669
No, boys. This way.

899
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:20,525
Well, there but for
the grace of God.

900
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:25,739
- I still don't know what instinct made me
step aside when he came at me.
- You need a drink.

901
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:28,533
I heard the lift coming up,
and I turned.

902
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:31,703
I saw that look in his eye
as he came toward me.

903
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:34,790
In that split second, the whole thing
flashed through my mind.

904
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:37,209
All I could think of was Fisher.

905
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:39,878
"Fisher planned this."

906
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:42,756
Then I guess I just stepped aside,
and over he went.

907
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:45,217
Over he went, all right.
Did you want this?

908
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:46,802
No, thanks.

909
01:11:46,928 --> 01:11:50,347
When are you going to send the story
to our esteemed gazette?

910
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:52,516
When I get ready.

911
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:54,685
Well, there goes another
of my illusions.

912
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:57,854
I thought you were one of those
journalists nothing could stop.

913
01:11:57,981 --> 01:12:00,983
Floods, smallpox, love...
the story must go on.

914
01:12:01,109 --> 01:12:03,694
It'll go on.

915
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:07,948
No. I can understand
you not wanting to drag
Miss Fisher into it.

916
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:10,409
On the other hand,
she's probably in it already.

917
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,577
- The moll of the gang.
- Why, you dirty...

918
01:12:12,704 --> 01:12:15,789
On second thought, I'm sure not.
I'm sure she's a fine girl...

919
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:17,749
upstanding, honest,
with a great soul.

920
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:20,752
I can't send the story
on Van Meer until he's safe.

921
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:23,422
We've got to find Van Meer first.

922
01:12:23,548 --> 01:12:26,633
Ah, there's our man now, probably.
Mr. Van Meer, come in.

923
01:12:28,136 --> 01:12:30,637
Good morning, Stebbins.
How are you, Haverstock?

924
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:33,432
Congratulations on your little
set-to with Rowley.

925
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:37,602
What do you know
about Rowley?

926
01:12:37,729 --> 01:12:40,355
Very little ffolliott doesn't hear.
He probably even knows about Fisher.

927
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:42,274
I was onto Fisher
a year ago...

928
01:12:42,442 --> 01:12:44,443
but that fellow
with the high-neck sweater...

929
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:46,945
- Krug... he's new to me...
- You're onto him too?

930
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:49,948
- Followed him to London.
- I thought you were cold on this story.

931
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:52,617
On the contrary.
I've been doing a bit of noticing.

932
01:12:52,744 --> 01:12:55,328
- Remember that tramp asleep in the mill?
- Yeah.

933
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:58,623
- He wasn't a tramp at all.
- Van Meer, I suppose.

934
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:02,419
Not quite, but I noticed him
do a strange thing for a tramp.

935
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:05,380
He dirtied his hands
with some of that nasty Dutch soil.

936
01:13:05,506 --> 01:13:08,341
I can't follow the workings
of these masterminds.

937
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:13,472
No.
Tell him it's ridiculous.

938
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:17,267
You'd already disappeared,
so I followed Krug...

939
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,394
but ended up
at the same old mousetrap.

940
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,937
You mean Fisher?

941
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:24,191
The good, kind, genial head
of the Peace Party, Herr Fisher.

942
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:28,987
Hello, Eddie?
This is Plunger Stebbins.

943
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:32,074
I want to place a bet
on Flibbertigibbet in the first...

944
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:36,286
The race is over?
What do you know about that?
Okay, I'll call you later.

945
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:39,164
Any objection to working
the rest of this thing together?

946
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:41,833
Catch Fisher, find Van Meer,
that sort of thing?

947
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:45,212
All right, but I'd like to know
why they kidnapped Van Meer.

948
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:47,839
He was one of the signatories
to a certain treaty.

949
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:50,050
The most important clause
was never written down...

950
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:52,344
just memorized
by the two people who signed.

951
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:54,179
They're gonna
beat it out of him?

952
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:57,682
They're going to try. It'd be
a good idea if we put a stop to them.

953
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:00,352
It contains information
that would be valuable to the enemy...

954
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,979
in the war that breaks out tomorrow,
weather permitting.

955
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:05,482
What? Why didn't someone
let me in on this?

956
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:08,527
- Stebbins, we've got to get busy.
- Plenty of time. Lunch first.

957
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:10,946
You mind waiting?
You might be of some help.

958
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:13,657
I thought up a little plan
for forcing Fisher's hand.

959
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:15,408
Let's have it.

960
01:14:15,535 --> 01:14:19,121
I think the neatest thing would be
to kidnap Fisher's daughter.

961
01:14:20,206 --> 01:14:23,875
- Oh, yeah?
- One of Fisher's few genuine traits
is his affection for Miss Fisher.

962
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:26,211
Easy. You're speaking
to the man who loves her.

963
01:14:26,337 --> 01:14:28,880
All the better. Give you
a chance to get chummy...

964
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:32,592
and keep her out of this mess
while we batter away at papa.

965
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:35,262
This is my scheme:
I walk in, let Fisher know...

966
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:37,889
his daughter's in the hands
of someone who means business...

967
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:41,560
just as he means business
when he kidnaps people.
He'll see things our way.

968
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:43,687
- Nothing doing.
- I thought you were a newspaperman.

969
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:46,314
That doesn't include kidnapping
your fiancée where I come from.

970
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:49,484
- It would if your country were at stake.
- This isn't my country.

971
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:52,571
It's your story. Don't be gloomy.
She doesn't have to know.

972
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:55,907
- Just keep her amused.
- Why not grab Fisher
and have a showdown?

973
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:59,744
No good. We've got nothing
on Fisher. He'd slip out of it anyway.

974
01:14:59,871 --> 01:15:02,539
All we'd do would be
to kill Van Meer.

975
01:15:02,665 --> 01:15:04,541
Mm.

976
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:08,336
Hello, darling. Are you all right?
What were you doing on the tower?

977
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:13,091
Trying to keep out of harm's way,
but those assassins followed.
There was a scuffle, and over he went.

978
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:15,510
Darling, they won't stop
till they get you.

979
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,846
You must leave London
immediately.

980
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:23,560
The one thing everybody
forgets is I'm a reporter.

981
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:25,478
There's a war.
I can't run out.

982
01:15:25,605 --> 01:15:29,107
Scott, he can't stay here.
Tell him how desperate these men are.

983
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:31,318
He shouldn't stay another minute.
Take him somewhere.

984
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:35,030
- I won't go.
- Couldn't you think up some aunt
in the country or something?

985
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:37,991
There's my Aunt Margaret
at Harpenden.
Let me take you there.

986
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:40,118
- How about it?
- Stay out of this.

987
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:42,412
It's the only
sensible thing to do.

988
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,706
May I use your telephone?

989
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:54,216
Hello, Stiles?
Miss Carol speaking.

990
01:15:54,342 --> 01:15:57,636
Tell Mr. Fisher I'm driving down
to Aunt Margaret's at Harpenden.

991
01:15:57,762 --> 01:16:00,597
- I won't go.
- I'll be back in time for dinner.

992
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:02,349
Thank you.

993
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:05,268
- It's settled.
We can get you a toothbrush...
- It's no good.

994
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:08,230
I'm wondering whether this idea
of your aunt is so good.

995
01:16:08,356 --> 01:16:10,357
Maybe it'd be better further out...
say, Cambridge.

996
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:13,777
- There's no place
as obscure as Harpenden.
- It isn't so much the place...

997
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:16,238
as the fact Krug
might connect you with it.

998
01:16:16,364 --> 01:16:19,658
- You're right. Make it Cambridge.
- I'll phone your father
so he doesn't worry.

999
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:22,661
Thank you, Scott.
Please, Johnny?

1000
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:37,008
That was a break, her suggesting
they go to the country.

1001
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:40,136
As a matter of fact, old boy,
I suggested it to her...

1002
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:42,305
on the phone
about half an hour ago.

1003
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:54,609
There hasn't been a sign
of anybody for the last 30 miles.

1004
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:57,988
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

1005
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:01,992
You might at least talk to me.
It's unfair to sit there and pout...

1006
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:04,869
because I've kidnapped you
from your so-called duties.

1007
01:17:04,996 --> 01:17:06,871
- You've kidnapped me?
- Mm-hmm.

1008
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:09,541
- Just remember that, will you?
- Please forgive me.

1009
01:17:09,709 --> 01:17:11,835
Why, sure.
I don't think kidnapping's...

1010
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:15,505
anything to get sore about when done
by the right kidnapper, do you?

1011
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:17,340
- Not at all.
- Thanks.

1012
01:17:24,724 --> 01:17:26,266
Hello?

1013
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:31,062
No, Mr. Ffolliott.
I'm afraid he's not in yet.

1014
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:32,731
Very well, sir.

1015
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:47,078
- Johnny, you don't love me.
- You're crazy.

1016
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:50,790
- You looked unhappy
when you kissed me.
- Never happier in my life.

1017
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:53,084
Won't do.
Johnny, what's happened?

1018
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:55,795
The war, I guess.
They say it's coming tomorrow.

1019
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:58,673
So you've changed
your philosophy since yesterday.

1020
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:01,343
There are more important things
in the world than love.

1021
01:18:01,469 --> 01:18:03,887
- I've got lots to do. Important things.
- Carol...

1022
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:06,765
Got to get started.
It'll take three hours to get back.

1023
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:10,101
I'm not going to be misunderstood.
I'm so in love, I'm going mad.

1024
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:12,604
Won't do.
I suppose it can't be helped.

1025
01:18:12,772 --> 01:18:15,023
You've turned European
on me overnight, Johnny.

1026
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:19,611
That's unfair. I'm just as big
a jackass as I ever was. Bigger.

1027
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:22,113
You're not going back
to London to dinner tonight.

1028
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:24,908
You can't run out
on your kidnapper like that.

1029
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:27,744
I mean...
Well, you know what I mean.

1030
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:30,413
If you run out on me now,
I'm going...

1031
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:32,749
straight to London
and let them bump me off.

1032
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:34,584
Be a relief at that.

1033
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:38,088
Well, you are moody.
Am I the cause?

1034
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:44,302
If you knew how much
I loved you, you'd faint.

1035
01:18:52,186 --> 01:18:54,312
There.
What'd I tell you?

1036
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:57,148
Come in.

1037
01:18:57,274 --> 01:18:58,900
- Mr. Haverstock?
- Yes?

1038
01:18:59,026 --> 01:19:01,152
- Call from London.
- Have them switch it up.

1039
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,446
Sorry, there's only one phone...
in the office.

1040
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,990
All right, I'll come down.

1041
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:08,451
Forgive me
for a moment, dear.

1042
01:19:14,417 --> 01:19:16,501
Just a moment, sir.

1043
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:24,509
Hello?

1044
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:28,304
Is that you, Haverstock, old boy?
Are you alone? Can you talk?

1045
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:32,225
I can't get a hold of Fisher.
He's been out all afternoon.

1046
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:35,687
I'm afraid you'll have to keep the girl
much longer than we'd planned.

1047
01:19:35,855 --> 01:19:39,190
I don't know what time he'll be back.
I've got to catch him alone.

1048
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:40,984
Keep the girl there
for the night.

1049
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:43,361
But that's
absolutely impossible.

1050
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:45,989
We can't let
this thing go now.

1051
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:51,077
I can't very well explain, but I simply
couldn't pull a thing like that.

1052
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:55,457
You've got to try. There isn't anything
else to be done. I'm counting on you.

1053
01:19:55,583 --> 01:20:00,128
Hello?

1054
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:12,557
Are you quite satisfied
with your room, sir?

1055
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:15,768
Well, not exactly.
That is, I mean, yes...

1056
01:20:15,895 --> 01:20:18,313
but I really wanted
another room as well...

1057
01:20:18,439 --> 01:20:20,273
a single room.

1058
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:22,859
Oh. Mr. Naismith?

1059
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:25,570
Mr. Naismith, this gentleman
wants another room.

1060
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:29,115
For the young lady?
How long will you be requiring it?

1061
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:32,160
She'll only be here
just the one night.

1062
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:37,582
- The gentleman has number 7, sir.
- What about number 8?

1063
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:42,378
It doesn't really make any difference,
so long as it's a good room...
windows and all that.

1064
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:44,255
I quite understand, sir.

1065
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:47,175
I think perhaps the room
next to yours would be best.

1066
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:50,470
It's quite cozy, isn't it,
Miss Pollitt? Number 8?

1067
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:53,598
- They're all very much alike to me, sir.
- Eight'll do.

1068
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:56,518
Will you bring the young lady
and sign the book, please?

1069
01:20:56,644 --> 01:20:59,145
Yes, I'll... I'll get her.

1070
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:20,458
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, Stiles.

1071
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:29,634
Terrible thing, sir, that poor man
who was here this morning.

1072
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:32,220
Yes, terrible, Stiles.
My bags all packed?

1073
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:34,430
- Yes, sir.
- And Miss Carol's?

1074
01:21:34,557 --> 01:21:37,892
Mrs. Stiles packed hers too.
She hopes she's put in the right things.

1075
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:41,062
It's been such a rush, especially
with Miss Carol not back yet.

1076
01:21:41,188 --> 01:21:43,898
Mr. Ffolliott's here now.
He's waiting in the sitting room.

1077
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:46,359
Another gentleman just phoned.
He wouldn't leave his name.

1078
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:50,280
I thought I recognized his voice
as the foreign gentleman
who was here at breakfast.

1079
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:53,533
- Did he say he'd telephone again?
- Yes, he said it was urgent.

1080
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:55,994
Well, show Mr. Ffolliott
into the study.

1081
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:16,514
- Hello, sir.
- Scott, you caught me
at a very busy moment.

1082
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,683
I'm getting ready to go
to America tomorrow.

1083
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:20,685
Are you taking
Carol with you?

1084
01:22:20,853 --> 01:22:24,772
Yes. She doesn't know yet.
It's been such a rush.
I'm waiting for her now.

1085
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:28,192
What's your worry? Must be important,
by the number of times you telephoned.

1086
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,153
Yes, it is, sir.
It's about Carol.

1087
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:33,531
- I'm afraid that...
- What? Anything happen to her?

1088
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:36,367
I don't think you'll be able
to take her to America.

1089
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:38,661
What do you mean?
Why not?

1090
01:22:40,039 --> 01:22:43,041
It'll sound rather silly to you,
but Carol has been kidnapped.

1091
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:45,918
- Is this a joke of some sort?
- No, sir.

1092
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,713
What do you mean,
"kidnapped"?

1093
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:51,424
I happen to know
she's with her aunt in Harpenden.

1094
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:53,426
I'm afraid she isn't.

1095
01:23:04,772 --> 01:23:08,733
Stiles, who gave you the message
that Miss Carol had gone
to her Aunt Margaret's?

1096
01:23:08,859 --> 01:23:11,569
Miss Carol herself, sir.

1097
01:23:11,695 --> 01:23:14,489
- Thank you, Stiles.
- That's where she thought
she was going.

1098
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:27,335
Get me Harpenden 43422.

1099
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:32,256
Hello, is that you, Margaret?

1100
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:34,092
Is Carol with you?

1101
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:39,263
No. No, I...

1102
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:42,642
I wasn't certain. She said
she might run down to see you.

1103
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:46,187
I didn't know whether
to expect her back for dinner.

1104
01:23:46,313 --> 01:23:48,564
Right.
Good night, Margaret.

1105
01:23:50,984 --> 01:23:52,902
No, she isn't there.

1106
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:55,947
What makes you say
she's been kidnapped?

1107
01:23:58,617 --> 01:24:01,577
Well, sir... I arranged it.

1108
01:24:05,124 --> 01:24:07,375
This has gone far enough.
Where is Carol?

1109
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:11,504
Carol's being held
as a sort of hostage...

1110
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:15,591
by some people who are
very much in earnest...
as much as you are.

1111
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:19,637
Don't be so cryptic.
I haven't the faintest idea
what you're talking about.

1112
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:24,767
I want to know
where you're hiding Van Meer.

1113
01:24:29,106 --> 01:24:32,650
So that's it.
You've been talking with Haverstock.

1114
01:24:32,776 --> 01:24:36,028
He was here this morning telling us
about Van Meer still being alive.

1115
01:24:36,155 --> 01:24:38,906
- You promised Haverstock
you'd look into it, didn't you?
- Naturally.

1116
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:43,035
An unusual way of looking into it,
trying to have him put out of the way.

1117
01:24:43,162 --> 01:24:46,706
I realize a life or two
is a small matter, the way you work.

1118
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:50,793
Well, the people who have got Carol
can take a leaf out of your book.

1119
01:24:52,671 --> 01:24:54,964
Where is she?
What have you done with her?

1120
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:57,633
Where's Van Meer?

1121
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:06,684
Hello?

1122
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:10,521
I think I can get our Dutch friend
to talk if you come along.

1123
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:14,192
Sorry to drag you here like this,
but I think it's the only way...

1124
01:25:14,318 --> 01:25:16,319
if you want
to leave tomorrow.

1125
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:19,322
When you get here,
ask at the cashier's desk...

1126
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:21,115
to use the phone.

1127
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:23,367
They'll show you straight up.

1128
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:27,705
Very well.
I'll drop in as soon as I can.

1129
01:25:27,831 --> 01:25:30,833
If you want Carol, you'd better
tell me where Van Meer is.

1130
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:34,545
- Bring her back.
I'll give you the address.
- Carol can be home in three hours...

1131
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:36,380
but I want
that address now.

1132
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:38,800
You'll have it
as soon as Carol is home.

1133
01:25:38,926 --> 01:25:41,135
I can't possibly
wait three hours.

1134
01:25:41,261 --> 01:25:44,180
Besides, I happen
to want Van Meer alive.

1135
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:16,212
Well, Scott,
I delivered him, all right.

1136
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:18,005
Good.

1137
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:22,093
I'll be getting along now.
Thanks very much
for those points for my leader.

1138
01:26:22,261 --> 01:26:25,012
Can I take them now?
Good night, Carol. Good night, sir.

1139
01:26:25,138 --> 01:26:26,764
Good night.

1140
01:26:31,562 --> 01:26:33,437
I beg your pardon, sir.

1141
01:26:47,578 --> 01:26:51,497
This isn't like you.
What is it that's upset you so?

1142
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:55,293
I know I'm being silly.
I'm behaving perfectly stupidly.

1143
01:26:55,419 --> 01:26:57,920
Please forgive me.

1144
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:00,089
I wouldn't mind so much...

1145
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:02,717
but I didn't think
he was that sort of person.

1146
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:07,805
Something to do
with young Haverstock?

1147
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:09,974
You like him very much,
don't you?

1148
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:14,604
After what happened today...
I drove him down to the country
to get him away from those people...

1149
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:17,565
I thought you were going
to Aunt Margaret's.

1150
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:19,734
We were,
but Scott ffolliott...

1151
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:22,945
thought it would be better
to go further away.

1152
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:25,114
So...

1153
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:28,951
I thought the College Arms
at Cambridge would be a good place.

1154
01:27:29,077 --> 01:27:31,662
When we got there,
I found out he wanted...

1155
01:27:32,873 --> 01:27:35,333
You see,
we'd been joking about it...

1156
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:38,961
but when I heard him book
the extra room, I knew he meant it.

1157
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:43,716
Such a cheap trick.
That's what hurts: It was so cheap.

1158
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:46,552
It wasn't at all
like I thought he was.

1159
01:27:48,013 --> 01:27:51,557
What difference does it make?
I don't care if I ever see him again.

1160
01:27:51,683 --> 01:27:54,560
You won't have to. We're going
to America tomorrow by clipper.

1161
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:57,313
Tomorrow?
Oh, but I can't.

1162
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:01,359
Well... I suppose I can,
but why tomorrow?

1163
01:28:01,485 --> 01:28:03,945
It's our last chance. War will
probably be declared tomorrow.

1164
01:28:04,071 --> 01:28:08,199
I have to get to Washington.
The boats will be crowded.
We're liable to wait weeks.

1165
01:28:08,325 --> 01:28:11,953
- But what about Mr. Van Meer?
- We've done all we could.

1166
01:28:12,079 --> 01:28:14,705
I was at the foreign office
with Ainsworth this afternoon.

1167
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:16,499
They're taking
the whole thing over.

1168
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:18,209
Stiles, what is it?

1169
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:21,587
- The blackout, sir.
I have to draw the blinds.
- Oh, I forgot.

1170
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:25,174
- Before you do that,
order me a taxi, will you?
- Yes, sir.

1171
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,551
I've got people I must see
before we leave.

1172
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:30,721
I'll try not to be long.
Mrs. Stiles has done your packing.

1173
01:28:30,847 --> 01:28:33,599
I thought we might go to Southampton,
stay at the Southwestern.

1174
01:28:33,725 --> 01:28:36,018
Stiles, and my hat, please.
Good-bye, darling.

1175
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:40,564
In the meantime, you and Stiles
might be loading the car
so as not to lose time.

1176
01:28:40,691 --> 01:28:42,608
- You'd better eat.
- What about you?

1177
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:44,568
I'll get a sandwich later.

1178
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:55,037
242 Charlotte Street...

1179
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,206
halfway up
Tottenham Court Road.

1180
01:29:05,799 --> 01:29:08,676
Wait here until Haverstock turns up.
He's bound to come here.

1181
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:11,595
Bring him along
to 242 Charlotte Street...

1182
01:29:11,722 --> 01:29:14,056
off Tottenham Court Road.

1183
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:25,943
- Hello?
- Hello. Hello?

1184
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:29,447
Hello.

1185
01:30:00,771 --> 01:30:03,522
Be careful.

1186
01:30:14,284 --> 01:30:17,078
Might I use your telephone?

1187
01:30:17,204 --> 01:30:18,829
This way, sir.

1188
01:30:39,059 --> 01:30:43,062
- Where is he?
- In there. We can't make him
say anything. It's up to you.

1189
01:30:43,188 --> 01:30:45,731
Let's get it over.
Is this place safe?

1190
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:48,400
There'll be no interruption.
We closed it for decoration.

1191
01:30:48,527 --> 01:30:51,070
- Those people downstairs?
- They won't make any trouble.

1192
01:30:51,196 --> 01:30:54,907
They know what will happen
to their relatives
in the homeland if they do.

1193
01:31:21,726 --> 01:31:25,020
Not a very attractive nest,
and the music a little vulgar...

1194
01:31:25,147 --> 01:31:26,480
but it serves its purpose.

1195
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:28,065
Yes.

1196
01:31:47,127 --> 01:31:48,836
Pardon me.

1197
01:31:53,592 --> 01:31:55,426
Put your arm around him...

1198
01:31:55,552 --> 01:31:57,303
and hold his head forward.

1199
01:32:00,056 --> 01:32:02,016
These lights...
can't you cut them down?

1200
01:32:09,441 --> 01:32:11,108
I thank you.

1201
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,737
Oh, I thank you very much.

1202
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:21,619
You're like my friend,
Mr. Fisher.

1203
01:32:21,745 --> 01:32:23,329
I'm sorry.

1204
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:25,456
It's just so dark.

1205
01:32:28,001 --> 01:32:29,960
I cannot tell, but...

1206
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:35,299
but you are
so like my friend.

1207
01:32:35,467 --> 01:32:38,219
I am Fisher, Mr. Van Meer.
I am your friend.

1208
01:32:38,345 --> 01:32:39,595
Oh!

1209
01:32:39,721 --> 01:32:42,181
I am so glad.

1210
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:45,601
Mr. Fisher,
are the police here?

1211
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:48,312
Oh, they mustn't get away.

1212
01:32:48,438 --> 01:32:51,815
You mustn't let
these people go.

1213
01:32:54,236 --> 01:32:58,155
I represent the Jupiter Life Assurance.
Could I interest you in a small policy?

1214
01:33:04,454 --> 01:33:07,498
- Why did you bring him up?
- I didn't know what to do.

1215
01:33:07,624 --> 01:33:09,333
I'd relieve the lady
of this embarrassment...

1216
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:11,502
but you know
how women are with firearms.

1217
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:13,671
No sense of timing.
I'll just sit here.

1218
01:33:13,797 --> 01:33:15,839
You carry on
with whatever you were doing.

1219
01:33:15,966 --> 01:33:18,509
Don't mind me.
I sometimes sit like this for hours.

1220
01:33:18,677 --> 01:33:20,636
Who's that?

1221
01:33:20,762 --> 01:33:23,222
Is it the police?

1222
01:33:23,348 --> 01:33:26,183
Oh, tell me where I am.

1223
01:33:26,351 --> 01:33:28,435
You are in London,
Mr. Van Meer.

1224
01:33:28,561 --> 01:33:30,771
In London?

1225
01:33:30,897 --> 01:33:33,023
Have I been here long?

1226
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:37,152
Oh, you must send
a telegram...

1227
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:39,029
to my wife.

1228
01:33:39,197 --> 01:33:41,532
Tell her
I am safe with you.

1229
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:44,576
Please try to understand.
The police are not here.

1230
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:47,246
I am here
merely to talk to you.

1231
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:50,374
But these... these people...

1232
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:53,627
They think I'm working with them.
They don't know I'm your friend.

1233
01:33:53,753 --> 01:33:56,088
We must play a little game.

1234
01:33:56,214 --> 01:33:58,716
- A little game?
- Yes.

1235
01:33:58,883 --> 01:34:01,385
They have asked me
to get you to tell me...

1236
01:34:01,511 --> 01:34:03,304
what they are trying
to find out.

1237
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:06,098
But I can't do that.

1238
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:08,100
You know I can't.

1239
01:34:08,226 --> 01:34:10,602
You can tell me,
Mr. Van Meer.

1240
01:34:10,729 --> 01:34:14,440
Just that one clause
in the treaty. Clause 27.

1241
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:17,318
Clause 27.

1242
01:34:17,444 --> 01:34:19,737
Come, Mr. Van Meer.

1243
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:23,198
But it's the... the secret clause.

1244
01:34:23,325 --> 01:34:27,036
I know it: Clause 27.

1245
01:34:27,162 --> 01:34:29,455
But they...
they mustn't know it.

1246
01:34:29,581 --> 01:34:32,124
It would help them
if they make war.

1247
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:36,086
War, Fisher. You don't
want them helped, do you?

1248
01:34:36,212 --> 01:34:38,005
Of course not.

1249
01:34:38,131 --> 01:34:40,424
Just let them see you
telling it to me.

1250
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:42,176
It'll be enough.

1251
01:34:42,302 --> 01:34:44,970
Just let them see you
whisper it to me.

1252
01:34:45,096 --> 01:34:48,015
I'll promise to keep it safe.

1253
01:34:48,141 --> 01:34:50,893
He's not your friend.
Don't tell him.

1254
01:34:51,019 --> 01:34:52,936
Who was that?

1255
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:57,024
Someone just said
you weren't my friend.

1256
01:34:58,777 --> 01:35:01,612
Why didn't you bring
the police?

1257
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:05,074
Why aren't you taking me
away from here?

1258
01:35:06,201 --> 01:35:07,659
Ah.

1259
01:35:07,786 --> 01:35:10,287
You are not
taking me away.

1260
01:35:11,373 --> 01:35:13,707
Why?

1261
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:15,459
You are so...

1262
01:35:15,585 --> 01:35:17,419
F-Fisher?

1263
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,216
Fisher!
Fisher, where are you?

1264
01:35:23,426 --> 01:35:25,177
Help me.

1265
01:35:25,303 --> 01:35:27,096
Help me, Fi...
Help...

1266
01:35:29,766 --> 01:35:32,518
Oh, yes.

1267
01:35:32,644 --> 01:35:34,853
I see now.

1268
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:36,772
There's no help.

1269
01:35:37,816 --> 01:35:41,276
No help for the whole...

1270
01:35:41,403 --> 01:35:44,655
poor, suffering world.

1271
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:47,408
Oh, you...

1272
01:35:47,534 --> 01:35:50,494
you cry peace, Fisher.

1273
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:53,497
Peace.
And there was no peace.

1274
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:58,419
Only war and death.

1275
01:35:58,545 --> 01:36:01,964
You're...
You're a liar, Fisher.

1276
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:04,383
A cruel, cruel liar.

1277
01:36:06,177 --> 01:36:09,513
You can do
what you want with me.

1278
01:36:09,681 --> 01:36:12,182
That's not important.

1279
01:36:12,308 --> 01:36:15,853
But you'll never
conquer them, Fisher.

1280
01:36:17,397 --> 01:36:20,732
Little people everywhere...

1281
01:36:20,859 --> 01:36:23,777
who give crumbs to birds...

1282
01:36:23,903 --> 01:36:25,988
lie to them...

1283
01:36:27,073 --> 01:36:30,367
drive them, whip them...

1284
01:36:30,493 --> 01:36:33,745
force them into war.

1285
01:36:33,872 --> 01:36:36,707
When the beasts like you...

1286
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:39,543
will devour each other...

1287
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:43,213
then the world...

1288
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:48,218
will belong
to the little people.

1289
01:36:48,344 --> 01:36:50,262
We're wasting valuable time.

1290
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:53,390
Kurt.

1291
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:21,543
All right. I...

1292
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:23,795
I will speak.

1293
01:37:25,757 --> 01:37:28,425
I will tell everything.

1294
01:37:28,593 --> 01:37:30,427
Come on, Mr. Fisher.

1295
01:37:32,889 --> 01:37:36,266
In the event
of invasion by an enemy...

1296
01:37:39,646 --> 01:37:42,189
Why, it's only a restaurant.

1297
01:37:42,315 --> 01:37:43,941
Look! Come on!

1298
01:37:44,067 --> 01:37:46,777
This way, sir!
Down the back stairs!

1299
01:38:12,512 --> 01:38:14,054
Follow me!

1300
01:38:29,654 --> 01:38:33,156
Come on, Haverstock!
They must've gone out some other way!

1301
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:46,753
You're an idiot if you don't nab Fisher
before he gets on that plane.

1302
01:38:46,879 --> 01:38:49,423
How can we arrest him
without any evidence?

1303
01:38:49,549 --> 01:38:52,175
Don't be so obstinate.
Isn't Van Meer himself proof enough?

1304
01:38:52,302 --> 01:38:54,052
No, and you ought to know it.

1305
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:56,179
What proof is there
against Fisher personally?

1306
01:38:56,306 --> 01:38:57,889
Of all the conceited,
stupid numbskulls...

1307
01:38:58,016 --> 01:39:01,310
If you'd stop behaving like
a Boy Scout and let us handle this...

1308
01:39:01,436 --> 01:39:03,186
Ask McKenna
to come in here.

1309
01:39:03,313 --> 01:39:06,106
Why don't you go see Dr. Boniface?
He's good for nerves.

1310
01:39:06,232 --> 01:39:08,191
- Identification of Van Meer complete?
- Absolutely.

1311
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:11,820
He's unconscious in the nursing home,
but there's no doubt it's Van Meer.

1312
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:14,197
You'd better get back there.
Take somebody with you.

1313
01:39:14,365 --> 01:39:16,617
Get a statement
as soon as he comes to.

1314
01:39:16,743 --> 01:39:21,496
In the meantime, send a man
to keep an eye on that flying boat
and await instructions from us.

1315
01:39:21,623 --> 01:39:25,751
What's the good of being
related to Scotland Yard?
I can't get my brother to do anything.

1316
01:39:25,877 --> 01:39:29,296
- Scotland Yard can't solve my problems.
- Scotland Yard's in on it.
Everybody but me.

1317
01:39:29,422 --> 01:39:33,717
You're in it too.
We've got to get on that plane
and keep an eye on Fisher.

1318
01:39:33,843 --> 01:39:36,553
While we're driving down,
ring up Mayfair 24574.

1319
01:39:36,679 --> 01:39:39,181
- Just a moment. Let me get it down.
- Mayfair 24574.

1320
01:39:39,307 --> 01:39:41,558
That's my cousin.
He's the director of the airline.

1321
01:39:41,726 --> 01:39:45,479
Tell him I've got to have two seats
on the clipper for America
tomorrow morning.

1322
01:39:45,605 --> 01:39:48,732
Then go to the Hilton Nursing Home
and stick by Van Meer.

1323
01:39:48,858 --> 01:39:52,694
Then phone Miss Edith Armbruster,
Kensington 66255.
Tell her I'm off to America.

1324
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:55,322
Will she dine with me next Monday
instead of tomorrow?

1325
01:39:55,448 --> 01:39:57,532
- Square it with her, will you?
- Sure, sure.

1326
01:39:57,659 --> 01:40:01,411
Then call up Stephens at the Post
and tell him I'm off to America.

1327
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:03,914
Cable New York.
Tell them I'm off to America.

1328
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:08,210
Then ring up
the Crescent Dancing Academy
and cancel my rumba lesson.

1329
01:40:08,336 --> 01:40:10,671
Two ham sandwiches
on rye bread.

1330
01:40:12,298 --> 01:40:15,050
There's no use my waiting around.
I have several things...

1331
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:19,096
Hard to say how soon he'll recover.
It may be hours before he can speak.

1332
01:40:19,222 --> 01:40:22,265
I don't know much about this,
but my friend's on the clipper.

1333
01:40:22,392 --> 01:40:25,268
The minute Van Meer speaks,
they'll send word to the plane.

1334
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:27,646
Did you hear the wireless?
We're at war.

1335
01:40:27,772 --> 01:40:31,233
War declared!
Read all about it! Special war edition!

1336
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:33,235
War declared! War!

1337
01:40:33,361 --> 01:40:35,904
It's war with Germany!
War declared!

1338
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:38,281
England declares war
on Germany!

1339
01:41:04,475 --> 01:41:07,894
Miss Pimm?
Miss Pimm, I found that picture.

1340
01:41:23,494 --> 01:41:26,329
- Steward, bring me
one of those, please.
- Yes, sir.

1341
01:41:57,695 --> 01:42:00,030
- Any message for me?
- What name, sir?

1342
01:42:00,156 --> 01:42:02,783
Steward, is there a message
for me? Mrs. Benson.

1343
01:42:02,909 --> 01:42:05,160
I'll be with you
in a minute, madam.

1344
01:42:05,286 --> 01:42:07,537
- This one's for me.
- Yes, sir.

1345
01:42:20,384 --> 01:42:22,344
Lovely, isn't it?

1346
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:25,847
Sort of makes you forget
all about the war and troubles.

1347
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:28,642
It would be nice
if we could just keep flying...

1348
01:42:28,768 --> 01:42:31,269
for a long time,
live in the clouds.

1349
01:42:31,395 --> 01:42:33,396
Yes, it would be very nice.

1350
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:37,818
But it's time for me
to make a landing...

1351
01:42:37,944 --> 01:42:39,903
a forced landing.

1352
01:42:40,029 --> 01:42:42,030
What's the matter?
Anything happen?

1353
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:45,700
I've got to talk to you.
I don't want to, but I've got to.

1354
01:42:45,827 --> 01:42:48,161
It's the hardest part...
talking to you now.

1355
01:42:48,287 --> 01:42:50,539
I don't mind
about the rest, really.

1356
01:42:50,665 --> 01:42:53,458
It's about Krug
and Van Meer.

1357
01:42:53,584 --> 01:42:55,043
You've guessed.

1358
01:42:55,169 --> 01:42:58,588
Not till last night.
I've just been worried.

1359
01:42:58,756 --> 01:43:00,549
But I believed in you.

1360
01:43:00,675 --> 01:43:02,342
You shouldn't.

1361
01:43:04,095 --> 01:43:06,930
It's true, then,
what I wouldn't believe?

1362
01:43:07,056 --> 01:43:08,598
Yes.

1363
01:43:08,724 --> 01:43:10,600
I'm to be arrested
when we land...

1364
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:13,603
- Oh!
- As a spy, shipped back to London.

1365
01:43:13,729 --> 01:43:16,606
- Father...
- That's quite all right, except...

1366
01:43:16,774 --> 01:43:19,359
just the one phase of it: You.

1367
01:43:20,444 --> 01:43:22,696
That's why
I've got to talk to you.

1368
01:43:23,906 --> 01:43:27,409
I should like you to hear a little
from my own point of view.

1369
01:43:27,535 --> 01:43:31,830
It might help you...
afterwards.

1370
01:43:31,956 --> 01:43:35,000
First about yourself,
my deceiving you.

1371
01:43:35,126 --> 01:43:38,962
I had to. I didn't want you involved
because you're English...
half English, anyway.

1372
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:42,924
I'm not. I'm just coated with
an English accent... a very thin coat.

1373
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:47,304
I've fought for my country
in my heart in a very difficult way...

1374
01:43:47,471 --> 01:43:49,931
because sometimes
it's harder to fight dishonorably...

1375
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:52,350
than nobly in the open.

1376
01:43:52,476 --> 01:43:55,353
I've used my country's methods
because I was born with them.

1377
01:43:55,479 --> 01:44:00,066
I don't intend making this sort
of plea to the court-martial.

1378
01:44:00,192 --> 01:44:03,820
I'm making it only to my daughter,
whom I've loved dearly...

1379
01:44:03,988 --> 01:44:07,157
and before whom
I feel a little...

1380
01:44:07,283 --> 01:44:08,950
ashamed.

1381
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:17,417
What you say to me now
means much more to me
than any other verdict...

1382
01:44:17,543 --> 01:44:18,960
my dear.

1383
01:44:19,086 --> 01:44:21,379
- Steward?
- Yes, sir?

1384
01:44:21,505 --> 01:44:23,715
This is not for me.
I was mistaken.

1385
01:44:25,343 --> 01:44:28,637
I'm not gonna sit here another 14 hours
and play hide-and-seek with her.

1386
01:44:28,763 --> 01:44:30,889
I'm gonna talk to her
and have it over with.

1387
01:44:31,015 --> 01:44:34,726
I don't see that you could do any harm.
He knows we're on the plane.

1388
01:44:34,852 --> 01:44:38,188
- Not a word in front of her, understand?
- I wouldn't dream of talking.

1389
01:44:38,314 --> 01:44:41,691
- What are you going to say?
- How do I know? I'm all mixed up.

1390
01:44:41,817 --> 01:44:44,694
In love with the girl
and gonna help hang her father.

1391
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:46,821
I've got to say something
or go crazy.

1392
01:44:47,865 --> 01:44:50,241
Would a little brandy
make you feel better?

1393
01:44:50,368 --> 01:44:53,036
You know it always
makes me cry harder.

1394
01:44:53,204 --> 01:44:54,996
- Oh!
- Surprise.

1395
01:44:55,122 --> 01:44:58,708
- What are you doing here?
- Just having myself a ride.

1396
01:44:58,834 --> 01:45:01,461
Look, Carol,
I've got to speak to you alone.

1397
01:45:01,587 --> 01:45:03,713
It's very important.
Do you mind, Mr. Fisher?

1398
01:45:03,839 --> 01:45:06,716
- Ffolliott's with you, isn't he?
- In a way, yes.

1399
01:45:06,842 --> 01:45:08,635
And you're both
after my father.

1400
01:45:08,761 --> 01:45:11,388
You're going to have him
arrested, aren't you?

1401
01:45:11,514 --> 01:45:15,058
I don't know what you're talking about.
I never arrested anyone in my life.

1402
01:45:15,184 --> 01:45:18,061
That's a lie. You've been
following him from the beginning.

1403
01:45:18,187 --> 01:45:21,481
That's why you wanted me
out of the way yesterday at the inn.

1404
01:45:21,607 --> 01:45:24,651
Pretended you loved me, tried to
keep me overnight so you could...

1405
01:45:24,777 --> 01:45:28,488
It's a lie, that's all.
Everything you've said
to me have been lies.

1406
01:45:28,614 --> 01:45:30,949
- Hello. Quite a reunion, isn't it?
- You too?

1407
01:45:31,075 --> 01:45:33,284
Please, dear.
Stay and have a drink, Scott.

1408
01:45:33,411 --> 01:45:35,286
- I'll be back.
- Where are you going?

1409
01:45:35,413 --> 01:45:38,206
Just to stretch my legs.
I read that wireless you received.

1410
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:41,209
- It was given to me by mistake.
- That's all right, sir.

1411
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:43,837
You're not going
unless I go with you.

1412
01:45:43,963 --> 01:45:47,298
I know you both think my father
is a traitor and a renegade.

1413
01:45:47,425 --> 01:45:49,426
Well, he isn't... not to me.

1414
01:45:49,552 --> 01:45:51,886
Thanks. It's a minority report,
but very welcome.

1415
01:45:52,013 --> 01:45:54,180
Carol, I've got nothing
to do with spies.

1416
01:45:54,306 --> 01:45:56,808
I'm just a reporter.
I came here after a story.

1417
01:45:56,934 --> 01:45:59,686
I'm sorry I heard of Van Meer.
I'd blow up the Globe...

1418
01:45:59,812 --> 01:46:02,230
and cut Mr. Powers's throat
rather than harm you.

1419
01:46:06,444 --> 01:46:08,111
What is it?

1420
01:46:10,740 --> 01:46:13,908
- They've gone crazy.
What do they think they're doing?
- Who are they?

1421
01:46:14,035 --> 01:46:17,203
Go below. Tell them
we're being attacked.

1422
01:46:22,710 --> 01:46:25,712
Sorry about this.
It has nothing to do with me.

1423
01:46:25,838 --> 01:46:29,883
- We're coming down.
- You're the most amazing,
cool-headed woman I've ever seen.

1424
01:46:30,009 --> 01:46:31,301
- Make Father wear this.
- Right.

1425
01:46:31,427 --> 01:46:33,053
Here you are.
Put these on.

1426
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:36,556
Keep changing.

1427
01:46:36,682 --> 01:46:39,184
Could you come out, sir?
They're all going nuts!

1428
01:46:39,310 --> 01:46:43,688
I'll be out immediately.
What am I going to say?
This isn't like bad weather.

1429
01:46:43,814 --> 01:46:46,149
Tell them it's a mistake,
that it's target practice.

1430
01:46:46,275 --> 01:46:50,361
I know it's foolish for me
to ask you to be calm.

1431
01:46:50,488 --> 01:46:52,447
We're doing the best we can.

1432
01:46:59,538 --> 01:47:02,040
Are we all going to be drowned?

1433
01:47:02,166 --> 01:47:04,250
Keep away
from that window, sir.

1434
01:47:04,376 --> 01:47:06,419
It might be dangerous.
Sit back.

1435
01:47:06,545 --> 01:47:09,380
I'm not going to put this on.

1436
01:47:09,507 --> 01:47:12,675
What are they firing at?
I never heard of anything so stupid.

1437
01:47:12,802 --> 01:47:15,095
I shall see the British consul
as soon as...

1438
01:47:28,984 --> 01:47:30,652
She's gone.

1439
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:38,451
What in the name of heaven
are they doing?

1440
01:47:46,001 --> 01:47:48,419
Switch off the gas.
You've got the other port motor.

1441
01:47:48,546 --> 01:47:51,589
- They cut off the other starboard motor.
Cut that off too.
- Right.

1442
01:47:51,715 --> 01:47:54,634
It's German, the Von Schier.
She thought we were a bomber.

1443
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:56,344
She's steaming to our rescue.

1444
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:59,389
The wing's coming off!

1445
01:48:02,184 --> 01:48:05,186
- Let me get out!
- Come away from that door!

1446
01:48:05,312 --> 01:48:06,771
We're crazy to stay here.

1447
01:48:06,897 --> 01:48:11,401
- When she hits the water,
the tail's the best place.
- Right. Let's get back there.

1448
01:48:43,475 --> 01:48:44,726
Look out!

1449
01:49:09,752 --> 01:49:11,461
Mr. Fisher!

1450
01:49:12,671 --> 01:49:14,130
Quick!

1451
01:50:43,971 --> 01:50:46,472
No good staying on here.
She's going under.

1452
01:50:46,598 --> 01:50:48,057
Quick! Onto the wing!

1453
01:51:41,528 --> 01:51:43,780
Look! There's the pilot!

1454
01:52:10,557 --> 01:52:14,185
- Don't let him on, fools!
We shall all go down!
- Shut your mouth!

1455
01:52:14,311 --> 01:52:16,771
- I'm gonna throw that swine off.
- No, he's right.

1456
01:52:16,897 --> 01:52:19,524
It won't hold us.
I'd better slip away.

1457
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:22,944
Quickly move to the other end.
That might make it lighter here.

1458
01:52:41,171 --> 01:52:43,673
Hurry! He's gone!

1459
01:52:54,184 --> 01:52:57,478
Johnny, don't go!
You'll be washed away!

1460
01:53:04,111 --> 01:53:05,695
Johnny, come back!

1461
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,229
Look!

1462
01:53:42,691 --> 01:53:45,401
It must be the enemy
coming to pick us up.

1463
01:53:46,403 --> 01:53:47,945
Is it the enemy?

1464
01:53:48,071 --> 01:53:50,490
We're all right.
She's American.

1465
01:53:54,453 --> 01:53:57,747
American ship Mohican
picked us all up,
taking us back to London.

1466
01:53:57,873 --> 01:54:00,249
I can't tell you what happened.
We're not allowed.

1467
01:54:00,417 --> 01:54:03,586
I'll wire from London
in a couple of days. Bye, Franklin.

1468
01:54:03,712 --> 01:54:07,048
This is awkward. I've just been
having a dirty row with the captain.

1469
01:54:07,174 --> 01:54:09,175
The fellow insists on acting
the true-blue neutral.

1470
01:54:09,301 --> 01:54:12,261
"Enemy waters." Not a line
to the press from his ship.

1471
01:54:12,387 --> 01:54:16,057
- Can't send out any stories?
- We can only use the wireless
for private messages.

1472
01:54:16,183 --> 01:54:19,185
"Hello, Aunt Effie. Safe aboard
the Mohican. Feeling tip-top."

1473
01:54:19,311 --> 01:54:23,856
I ask you!
Two days before we get to London,
we get scooped on our own story.

1474
01:54:23,982 --> 01:54:27,026
- Why don't you have a crack
at brass buttons?
- What's the use?

1475
01:54:27,152 --> 01:54:29,612
What good will it do me?
My hands are tied.

1476
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:31,447
- What are you talking about?
- Carol.

1477
01:54:31,573 --> 01:54:33,366
I came 4,000 miles
to get a story.

1478
01:54:33,492 --> 01:54:35,952
I get shot at like a duck,
pushed off buildings...

1479
01:54:36,078 --> 01:54:38,829
I get the story,
and then I got to shut up.

1480
01:54:38,956 --> 01:54:42,333
What are you grinning at? I'm not
gonna throw her father up for grabs.

1481
01:54:42,459 --> 01:54:45,836
He died like a hero
to save her and the rest of us.

1482
01:54:45,963 --> 01:54:48,464
I guess I'm talking
through my hat.

1483
01:54:48,590 --> 01:54:50,633
The whole point is
he was her father...

1484
01:54:50,759 --> 01:54:53,219
and I'm not gonna play Judas
to the only girl...

1485
01:54:53,345 --> 01:54:55,221
I'm glad you've said that.
Very glad.

1486
01:54:55,347 --> 01:54:57,473
- You dry? You all right?
- I'm all right.

1487
01:54:57,641 --> 01:54:59,892
I want you to send it,
the whole story.

1488
01:55:00,018 --> 01:55:02,103
- We'll talk about that later.
- No, please.

1489
01:55:02,229 --> 01:55:05,273
You can't help me
by protecting my father.

1490
01:55:05,399 --> 01:55:09,819
Listen, I'm in love with you.
I can't hit you with a scandal
for a wedding present.

1491
01:55:09,945 --> 01:55:13,656
Johnny, my father fought
for his country his way.

1492
01:55:13,824 --> 01:55:16,701
It wasn't a straight way,
but it was a hard way.

1493
01:55:16,827 --> 01:55:19,954
And I've got to fight
for my country a hard way.

1494
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:22,748
Okay, if that's the way
you feel about it.

1495
01:55:22,874 --> 01:55:25,501
I guess that's for me.

1496
01:55:25,627 --> 01:55:29,088
I put in a call to my uncle...
Uncle Powers.

1497
01:55:29,214 --> 01:55:31,674
Hello? Hello?

1498
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:33,509
Johnny Jones
calling from the Mohican.

1499
01:55:33,677 --> 01:55:37,680
What the deuce is he doing there?
Wait. Johnny wouldn't call
if it wasn't a story.

1500
01:55:37,806 --> 01:55:40,308
Tell them to hold the presses.
Send Bradley in.

1501
01:55:40,434 --> 01:55:42,727
Tell him we're breaking up
page one. Hello?

1502
01:55:42,853 --> 01:55:44,854
Hello, Mr. Powers.
This is Johnny Jones.

1503
01:55:44,980 --> 01:55:46,522
Easy.
Here comes the captain.

1504
01:55:49,318 --> 01:55:51,652
Mr. Powers, keep your ear
glued to this phone...

1505
01:55:51,778 --> 01:55:53,529
and don't hang up.

1506
01:55:59,036 --> 01:56:02,038
- Mr. Haverstock,
I want to talk with you.
- Yes, sir?

1507
01:56:02,205 --> 01:56:05,041
- I've just found out
you're a newspaperman.
- I guess that's right.

1508
01:56:05,167 --> 01:56:08,127
Why didn't you tell me that
when I questioned you?

1509
01:56:08,253 --> 01:56:10,671
- You lied to me, sir.
- My dear captain...

1510
01:56:10,797 --> 01:56:14,050
when you've been shot down in
a British plane by a German destroyer...

1511
01:56:14,217 --> 01:56:17,219
300 miles off the coast of England...
latitude 45...

1512
01:56:17,346 --> 01:56:19,889
and have been hanging on
to a half-submerged wing for hours...

1513
01:56:20,015 --> 01:56:23,059
waiting to drown with half a dozen
other stricken human beings...

1514
01:56:23,226 --> 01:56:25,936
you're liable to forget
you're a newspaperman for a moment.

1515
01:56:26,063 --> 01:56:30,024
You're gonna have to forget it
for as long as you're on this ship.

1516
01:56:30,150 --> 01:56:32,068
I can't understand
your attitude, sir.

1517
01:56:32,235 --> 01:56:35,112
You performed a heroic rescue.
Captain John Martin.

1518
01:56:35,238 --> 01:56:38,574
- You took us out of the sea.
- You're not sending
anything from this ship.

1519
01:56:38,700 --> 01:56:40,951
- That's final.
- You're absolutely right, Captain.

1520
01:56:41,078 --> 01:56:43,412
We mustn't embarrass
the United States government.

1521
01:56:43,538 --> 01:56:44,955
Exactly. That's my point.

1522
01:56:47,042 --> 01:56:50,086
That's the story.
If you don't want me to print it, okay.

1523
01:56:50,212 --> 01:56:52,672
- But you ought to hear it first.
- That's only fair.

1524
01:56:56,843 --> 01:57:00,304
You know who the head
of that movement was in London?
Stephen Fisher.

1525
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:04,100
What? You mean the man who ran
the Universal Peace Party?
That's preposterous!

1526
01:57:04,226 --> 01:57:07,228
Yes, the same Mr. Fisher
who was drowned a few hours ago.

1527
01:57:07,354 --> 01:57:10,439
He was using the Peace Party
as a cover-up for spies and traitors.

1528
01:57:10,565 --> 01:57:12,817
He was going to be arrested
and sent back to England.

1529
01:57:12,943 --> 01:57:17,071
- Those are facts.
- I can't believe it.
He was a friend of mine.

1530
01:57:17,197 --> 01:57:20,783
The same Stephen Fisher
who engineered the kidnapping
of Van Meer, the Dutch diplomat.

1531
01:57:20,909 --> 01:57:23,452
- You don't expect
anybody to believe that.
- It's the truth.

1532
01:57:23,620 --> 01:57:25,538
- I refuse...
- Captain, wait a minute.

1533
01:57:25,664 --> 01:57:29,417
This young lady should know
whether my friend is speaking
the truth about Mr. Fisher.

1534
01:57:29,543 --> 01:57:32,837
Yes, I ought to know.
Mr. Fisher was... my father.

1535
01:57:32,963 --> 01:57:35,923
And I want the story printed.

1536
01:57:36,049 --> 01:57:37,633
What's that?

1537
01:57:37,759 --> 01:57:40,970
Oh, I guess
that's my uncle. Uh...

1538
01:57:41,138 --> 01:57:43,264
Hello? Oh, hello, Uncle.
How are you?

1539
01:57:45,434 --> 01:57:48,686
How's Aunt Sadie?
I'm all right, thanks.

1540
01:57:48,812 --> 01:57:52,148
We had a little accident,
but I can't tell you about it now.

1541
01:57:52,274 --> 01:57:56,068
I'll tell you later. I'll write you.
Yes, I'm going back to Europe.

1542
01:57:56,194 --> 01:57:58,863
I was wondering
if you had any instructions for me.

1543
01:57:58,989 --> 01:58:01,073
Yes. Keep on the job.

1544
01:58:01,199 --> 01:58:03,701
Have you got all that?
Rush it out at once.

1545
01:58:16,590 --> 01:58:19,175
This is London.
We have as a guest tonight...

1546
01:58:19,301 --> 01:58:21,093
one of the soldiers
of the press...

1547
01:58:21,219 --> 01:58:24,013
one of the little army
of historians writing history...

1548
01:58:24,139 --> 01:58:26,140
from beside
the cannon's mouth...

1549
01:58:26,266 --> 01:58:29,560
the foreign correspondent
of the New York Globe,
Huntley Haverstock.

1550
01:58:29,686 --> 01:58:31,187
Hello, America.

1551
01:58:31,354 --> 01:58:34,482
I've been watching a part
of the world being blown to pieces.

1552
01:58:34,608 --> 01:58:37,359
A part of the world as nice
as Vermont and Ohio...

1553
01:58:37,486 --> 01:58:39,487
And Virginia and California and Illinois...

1554
01:58:39,613 --> 01:58:42,406
lies ripped up and bleeding
like a steer in a slaughterhouse.

1555
01:58:42,532 --> 01:58:46,076
I've seen things that make
the history of the savages
read like Pollyanna legends...

1556
01:58:46,203 --> 01:58:48,829
It's a raid. We shall have
to postpone the broadcast.

1557
01:58:48,955 --> 01:58:52,500
- Let's go on as long as we can.
- We have a shelter downstairs.

1558
01:58:52,626 --> 01:58:54,543
How about it, Carol?

1559
01:58:54,669 --> 01:58:57,505
- They're listening in America, Johnny.
- Okay.

1560
01:58:57,631 --> 01:58:59,548
We'll tell them, then.

1561
01:58:59,674 --> 01:59:02,927
I can't read the rest of the speech...
the lights have gone out...

1562
01:59:03,053 --> 01:59:05,346
so I'll just have to talk
off the cuff.

1563
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:08,766
All that noise you hear isn't static.
It's death coming to London.

1564
01:59:08,892 --> 01:59:12,436
They're coming now.
You can hear the bombs falling
on the streets and homes.

1565
01:59:12,562 --> 01:59:16,440
Don't tune me out.
This is a big story, and you're part of it.

1566
01:59:16,566 --> 01:59:20,611
It's too late to do anything here except
stand in the dark and let them come.

1567
01:59:20,737 --> 01:59:24,114
It's as if the lights were all out
everywhere... except in America.

1568
01:59:24,241 --> 01:59:26,200
Keep those lights burning.

1569
01:59:26,326 --> 01:59:28,536
Cover them with steel,
ring them with guns...

1570
01:59:28,662 --> 01:59:31,747
build a canopy of battleships
and bombing planes around them.

1571
01:59:31,915 --> 01:59:34,124
Hello, America!
Hang on to your lights.

1572
01:59:34,251 --> 01:59:36,752
They're the only lights left
in the world.
