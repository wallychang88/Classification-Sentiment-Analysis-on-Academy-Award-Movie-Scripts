1
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:32,119
"Flash, the freighter,
Star of Capetown,

2
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:36,924
"was sunk today off the north coast
of Africa by a mysterious explosion.

3
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,592
"All hands accounted for

4
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:42,129
"with the exception
of two unidentified stowaways."

5
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:52,639
Look at us.
Two on a raft, sunny-side up.

6
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,642
"I'll tell you how to get home," you said.
"We'll stow away," you said.

7
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:59,513
"No, sir," I said. "Don't be a
sap," you said. "No, sir," I said.

8
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,258
"We're stowing away,
and that's that," you said.

9
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:02,383
"No, sir," I said.

10
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,384
Yak, yak, yak, yak,
yak, yak, yak, yak.

11
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:06,087
What a brilliant
conversationalist you are!

12
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,690
I took one look at that crate and
knew it would blow up in our faces.

13
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,659
Wait till they find out who was
smokin' in the powder room.

14
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,728
Never mind that now.
Look at us.

15
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,031
Food gone, water gone.

16
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,933
Hey! What's that bulge
in your pocket?

17
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:21,969
Oh, that's...

18
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:23,170
Yeah, that.
That there.

19
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,072
It's just an old
tobacco pouch. It's...

20
00:03:25,106 --> 00:03:27,074
Tobacco pouch? When did
you start smokin' a pipe?

21
00:03:27,108 --> 00:03:28,685
I... Ever since this morning. Cigarettes
make me nervous. Oh, this morning?

22
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,588
You just went down to the store and got
yourself a meerschaum and some tobacco?

23
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:32,546
Yes, I did.
You notice...

24
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,249
That's clever. Come on, come on.
Dig, dig.

25
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:38,685
Hand it over here. Let's see.
Come on, reach.

26
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,621
Oh! I forgot.

27
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:41,555
Surprised, huh?

28
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,457
I figure two of 'em
for one of us is better

29
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,060
than one of 'em for two of us.
Yeah.

30
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:48,595
Here, you can spit
your teeth in there.

31
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,664
Just dunk it lightly.

32
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:55,702
Well, Junior, we gotta face it.

33
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:59,740
We may be days, and days, and days,
without seeing a ship or land.

34
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,742
We're gonna get hungry,
mighty hungry.

35
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:04,178
What do you mean "get hungry"?

36
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,712
We'll toss a coin.

37
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,649
What's the date?
Hea...

38
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:11,418
1910!

39
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,288
Pretty close.
1911.

40
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,689
Well, that's the way it goes.

41
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,225
Somebody loses, somebody wins.

42
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:21,595
Okay, so you win the nickel! See if you
can find any white meat on that buffalo.

43
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:25,399
I got a TL for you. We tossed for
something much deeper than that.

44
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,237
I remember a story once
about two fellows like us.

45
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:33,307
Castaways.
They tossed a coin, too.

46
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,353
They figured there's no use
both of them starving.

47
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:37,978
Well, naturally.

48
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,648
The fellow who survived used to tell his
grandchildren about his pal's sacrifice.

49
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:44,251
Hey, that's very...
Wait a minute.

50
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:45,786
What pal's sacrifice?

51
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,788
I don't know, though.

52
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,799
You should've eaten more
oatmeal when you were a kid.

53
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,692
You're kind of scrawny.
No firmness there.

54
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:55,596
I don't think you'd do me more than a
week, and there's no icebox aboard.

55
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,065
Jeff, Jeff, you're losing
your buttons.

56
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:00,634
You mean, you'd eat me,
without vegetables?

57
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,403
Calm down, now.
Calm down, Junior.

58
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,405
I'm not gonna
do anything right away.

59
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:07,508
I might not do anything for a week or so.
Not until I get desperate.

60
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,343
Oh, Jeff!

61
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,688
You wouldn't like me. Once I bit
my tongue and I tasted awful.

62
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,714
Help!
Jeff, don't...

63
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,683
Turkey, look!

64
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:19,120
Look, am I seeing things?
What?

65
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,221
Look here.

66
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:21,388
What is that over there?

67
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:22,656
Land! Land!

68
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,458
We're saved!
We're saved!

69
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,760
Hey! Hey!
A submarine!

70
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,496
Man the pumps!
Man the pumps!

71
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,242
Last stop!

72
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:43,144
Got a stone in my shoe.

73
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,746
Hey, wait a minute!

74
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:51,752
A fine pal. All I hope is that Aunt
Lucy's lookin' down from above

75
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,754
and seein' the way
you're treating me lately.

76
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:56,457
You gonna start stuffing that
Aunt Lucy down my throat again?

77
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,359
Yeah, well, never mind.

78
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:01,328
She saw you tossin'
that coin and lickin' your chops.

79
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:04,798
You're certainly sloughing off
your promise to her.

80
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,402
Aunt Lucy. I can see her
now lying on her dying bed

81
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:11,805
lookin' at you with those big,
trusting eyes.

82
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:15,742
"Before I go, Jeff, promise
me one thing," she said.

83
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:19,713
"Promise me you'll always be a
friend to little Orville," she said.

84
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:23,450
"No matter what happens, you'll never
leave the little jerk," she said.

85
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:26,153
"Promise me, Jeff.
Promise me," she said.

86
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:28,722
Yeah, then she up and died
before I had a chance to say no.

87
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,726
Who you shushing?
What's the matter?

88
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,197
I hope she didn't hear. The dead
have a way of comin' back, you know.

89
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,532
Get out. When they're
dead, they're dead.

90
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,901
Not Aunt Lucy.
She was a Republican.

91
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:44,738
Okay, Junior, I'm sorry.

92
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,773
I guess I shouldn't have said that.
All right.

93
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:49,510
You know how I feel about you.

94
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:52,346
I guess in my own way
I sort of love you.

95
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:59,186
All right, but you don't
have to slobber all over me.

96
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,488
I guess I kind of love you, too.

97
00:07:03,324 --> 00:07:06,760
Yeah. Now wait a minute, Junior.
Stop kissing me.

98
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,362
What are you talkin' about?
I didn't...

99
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:09,930
You did, too!

100
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,333
Look, are you crazy?
I don't mind being kissed,

101
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:14,268
but this is ridiculous.

102
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:16,870
There, you did it again.

103
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:17,771
I did not.

104
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,873
You didn't?
No.

105
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:23,477
Well, I felt something.
Something like a wet paint brush.

106
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,313
You did?

107
00:07:26,347 --> 00:07:28,282
I did, too.
I thought it was you.

108
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,750
And I thought it was you.

109
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,421
You see!
Aunt Lucy's come back.

110
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:37,724
You did it with all that
disrespectful talk. Aunt Lucy!

111
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,297
What's that?
What?

112
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,566
What's the matter?
You yellow?

113
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,401
It's only a kangaroo.
Yeah.

114
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:49,803
What're you gettin' scared for?

115
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,273
Let's take a ride.
This is probably...

116
00:07:56,377 --> 00:07:57,978
Good girl.
Good girl.

117
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:02,816
You think we got enough gas?

118
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,985
I got her carburetor
cut down to nothin'.

119
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,020
Where do you suppose we are?

120
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:10,524
This must be the place where they
empty all the old hourglasses.

121
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:14,328
I think this is what's left
after I clean my spinach.

122
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,996
Hey, look!

123
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,832
Could've thought of another
way to get us here.

124
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,034

00:11:44,605 --> 00:11:46,172
What'd he come to town for?
A manicure?

172
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,142
He loves the Princess
Shalmar of Karameesh.

173
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,144
He has come here
to ask her to marry him.

174
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:54,981
I'd hate to be around
when he comes for a divorce!

175
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,049
You short of blades?

176
00:11:57,818 --> 00:11:59,986
It's a strange country, buster.
It's a strange country.

177
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,187
Yeah.

178
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,825
Well, not too strange.

179
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:05,959
It's food we're after.

180
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:08,595
That's what I say, food. Yes.
Remember?

181
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,229
Food.

182
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:16,069
No, thanks,
we ate four days ago.

183
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:20,240
I wish I had
my drool cup with me.

184
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:32,919
Allah be praised. Allah be praised.
Allah be praised.

185
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,861
Allah be praised.

186
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:46,299
What is this? Free cold cuts!
Everything on the house.

187
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:50,270
Well, what are we waiting for?
Shangri-La.

188
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,739
Allah be praised, brother.
We'll get loaded.

189
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,741
This is living!

190
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:57,811
Hey, what's the idea? The other
fellow did it. Why can't he?

191
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:01,682
Allah has seen fit to dim
the light of his wisdom.

192
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:04,284
To us, such unfortunate ones
are sacred.

193
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:08,989
Well, I don't think that's...
Shh!

194
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:17,774
Hey, what's the matter?
What are you doing?

195
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,041
What are you lookin'
at me like that for?

196
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:21,334
Turkey, from now on,
you're sacred.

197
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,903
What do you mean, sacred?

198
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,871
You just became a
full-blooded American idiot.

199
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:27,574
No, you do it. Who's gonna
believe I'm an idiot?

200
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:28,951
Well, will you look at
the head start you got?

201
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,176
Now, all you gotta do is

202
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,154
go into a shop, put on that
silly look, and talk like this.

203
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,047
Now watch.

204
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,718
I'll take some of those, some
of these and some of those.

205
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:38,919
Let me have that slow.

206
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:40,587
Like this.
I'll take some of these,

207
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:43,189
and give me a few
of them there...

208
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,059
You feel all right, daddy?

209
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,928
Let me hear you do it now,
come on.

210
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,972
I'll take some of those,
and some of those over there.

211
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,232
That's great. That's great.
That's wonderful.

212
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:53,466
The first shop we go into,

213
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,244
the guy'll load us up and throw
in his daughter. Come on.

214
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,436
His daughter?
Yes.

215
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,080
I'll take some of those
and some of those, too.

216
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,906
Don't over-train.
Save it.

217
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,340
Give me some of those over there
and you want some, too? Okay.

218
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:11,284
What can I do for you,
gentlemen?

219
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,754
Go, ahead.
Tell him, Junior.

220
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:15,627
I want some of those
and some of those

221
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:16,757
and some of those...

222
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,992
Hey! Are you making fun of me?

223
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,360
Oh, no, I always talk like this.

224
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,863
Oh, you do, huh?
Well, why do you?

225
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:25,031
Oh, because I can't help it.
I'm an idiot. I'm sacred.

226
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:27,868
So you're saying
I'm an idiot, too?

227
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,279
Oh, if you think you're an idiot
I'm not gonna argue with you...

228
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,805
What's that?

229
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:37,143
Okay, I'll take some of those,

230
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,880
and some of those,
and some of those...

231
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:45,085
Well, what do you think of that?

232
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:48,388
How do you like that?
Jeff, Jeff!

233
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,855
Mother told me there'd be
moments like this.

234
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:23,323
I wonder how she knew.

235
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:24,725
Hey, Turkey.
Where've you been?

236
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:25,902
I've been lookin'
everywhere for you.

237
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,961
Do it some more.

238
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:29,229
What's the matter with you?

239
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,463
Do it some more.
Kiss it again.

240
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,332
What'd the guy hit you with?
A piano?

241
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,400
Hey, come on.
Snap out of it. Hey!

242
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,269
It's a strange country.

243
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,371
A minute ago she came
along in a gold box,

244
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,340
fellows carrying it with sticks.

245
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:44,044
She took my hand, kissed my
fingertips, my knuckles, my wrist.

246
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:47,948
My toes are still braided. Oh, it
was wonderful. Do it some more.

247
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:49,916
Hey, hey. Come on, now.
You're delirious.

248
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,260
You need something
in your stomach.

249
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,494
Come on, boy.
You'll be all right.

250
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,155
Come on, boy.
Here we go.

251
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:05,131
Hey, how do you figure
on paying for all this?

252
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,400
What? Are you scared?
You got red blood, ain't you?

253
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,803
Yeah, but I don't
wanna get it all over strangers.

254
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,472
Go ahead. Eat up. Eat up, son.
I'll think of something.

255
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:14,316
These guys don't monkey around.
They got knives.

256
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,911
They're liable to try and get
the food back the hard way.

257
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:25,018
You have already eaten
to the amount of 230 kolacs.

258
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,753
You have money to pay, yes?

259
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:29,322
Yeah. Yeah, we'll pay.
But we're still eating.

260
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,324
Put it on separate checks, too.

261
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,227
Oh, and bring us a couple of more
portions of those jellied-turtle eggs.

262
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,337
Yes, and the turtle
that laid them.

263
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,662
Bring her in.

264
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:39,108
And don't be afraid to spread a
lot of pixie dust, double layer.

265
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,134
You have already
eaten six portions.

266
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,304
Well, can we help it
if we're turtle-egg fiends?

267
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,876
First chance we get, we better
dash for the nearest exit.

268
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,511
Yeah, but how about
that guy's knife?

269
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:55,115
We're gonna look silly stumbling
out of here on a set of stumps.

270
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,850
Have a nut burger
and forget about it.

271
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:58,160
I can hardly wait
for the dessert.

272
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,485
What are we having?

273
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,192
Say, what do you usually tip?
Ten percent?

274
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:08,061
Let's not spoil him.

275
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:24,177
Go ahead, buster.
Blubber wants to talk to you.

276
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,512
I think I better...
I'd better go, huh?

277
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,057
If he gets tough,
don't worry about a thing,

278
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:30,550
I'll be right here
under the table.

279
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,919
Buy a rug for me.

280
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,586
Garcon!

281
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,321
Who is that?
The local bookmaker?

282
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:11,524
Here's 287 kolacs for the
little snack and five for you.

283
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,259
Get yourself a facial, huh?

284
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,996
Well, come, come. Let little
Orville in on this deal.

285
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:17,306
How'd you get the spinach,
old boy?

286
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,641
There's a funny thing. A guy I've
never seen before in my life

287
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:23,403
gives me 2,500 kolacs. That's 200
federal diplomas. Are you listening?

288
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,071
Two hundred skins?
Why, what for?

289
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,206
I sold him something.

290
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,316
Well, you've got
nothing to sell.

291
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,274
We've already
hocked your pivot tooth.

292
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:29,919
Well, it wasn't much
but it was all I had,

293
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,444
and was he anxious to get it.

294
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,413
What did you sell him?

295
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,516
Look, Orville,

296
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:39,552
I want you to keep very calm now.
And don't get excited.

297
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,854
What did you sell him?

298
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,290
You.

299
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,126
Oh, well,
for a minute, I... Huh?

300
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:47,593
Me! Wait a minute.

301
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,362
Get that guy and give
him those fish back!

302
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,472
What's the matter with you?
You can't sell me.

303
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,366
I'm not a horse. It's just
the way I comb my hair.

304
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,044
I know, Orville. You and I
know you're not a horse.

305
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:56,545
But these people
are peculiar around here.

306
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59,248
What are you talking about? Are you
going nuts? Why would a guy buy a guy?

307
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:01,483
I don't know. I don't know. They
buy anything. Any old junk.

308
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:02,584
But you can't do that to me.

309
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,377
You can't sell me.
You don't own me.

310
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,913
Oh, no, not now.
No. He does.

311
00:19:06,947 --> 00:19:09,382
Why would he buy me?
What does he want me for?

312
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,217
I didn't ask him.

313
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,518
Wait a minute?

314
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:13,954
You sold me
to a zombie like that,

315
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,231
and you don't even know
what he wants me for?

316
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:16,498
You've got to
be careful, Turkey,

317
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:17,457
when you're dickering
with these people.

318
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,592
You gotta knock 'em off
while they're hot.

319
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,836
Do you know why they buy guys in
a country like this? For slaves!

320
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,571
They hit you with whips,
they put you to pickin' cotton,

321
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,130
they beat you,
and they beat you...

322
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,531
Wait. They don't
pick cotton here.

323
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:26,642
Well, they beat you
for whatever they're pickin'.

324
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,434
I know, I saw
Uncle Tom's Cabin twice.

325
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:30,370
Now, look, will you
relax a minute?

326
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:31,337
I've got this thing all figured out.
See, I've got plans.

327
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:32,438
But I...

328
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:33,782
I've got the guy's address
and I'm gonna get you back.

329
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:37,177
And when I do, we'll be where we
are now, only 200 bucks ahead.

330
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,344
What's that, nothing?

331
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:40,280
Well, that's something.
It might work out.

332
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:41,481
And a 100 of that is mine.

333
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,524
That's what I'm telling you.

334
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,284
Well, come on.
Put me in the higher brackets.

335
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,186
There's no use
giving it to you now.

336
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:48,630
If anything goes wrong, with the
plans, why, the money'd be wasted.

337
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,323
If anything goes wrong?
Yeah.

338
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,791
Well, I'm gettin' out of here.

339
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,735
See, you might have sold me, see, but
you're not gonna deliver me, see,

340
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,428
because I'm not
gonna be here, see.

341
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:56,696
Wait, wait, wait.
No, sir, see.

342
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,707
I don't have to deliver you.
They're coming to pick you up.

343
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:01,667
Coming to...
What? Pick me up?

344
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,579
Well, who do you think you're
playing with, children?

345
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:06,272
You're talking to Turkey,
the man with the muscles. I...

346
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:07,673
Wait a minute.
Turn the lights on.

347
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,142
Wait a minute.
What's going on here?

348
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:13,113
Wait just a second.
Aunt Lucy! Aunt Lucy!

349
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:15,948
The least you could do
is wrap me as a gift.

350
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,431
Geoffrey.
Geoffrey!

351
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,667
Huh?
What do you want?

352
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,436
You're a naughty, naughty boy.

353
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,747
You shouldn't have done that
wicked thing to little Orville.

354
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:41,707
You must find him, Geoffrey, you must
find him at once and bring him back.

355
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,609
Oh, I'm so distressed.

356
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:45,611
Well, I didn't know, Aunt Lucy.

357
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:47,580
Honest, I didn't.
The fellow I sold him to

358
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,750
was only a jobber and he
resold him later at a profit.

359
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,052
He wouldn't tell me to who.

360
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,087
"To whom," Geoffrey,
"To whom."

361
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,757
Yes, ma'am, to whom. But I
still don't know where he is.

362
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,626
Well, you've got to find him, Geoffrey.
Little Orville needs you.

363
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,729
Well, what can I do, Aunt Lucy? I've
been looking for him for a week.

364
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:07,133
Geoffrey, you remember that song you
used to sing? The one Orville loved?

365
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:08,677
Which song was that, Aunt Lucy?
Oh, you know.

366
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:10,803
♪ Ho-ho-hum,
you hear me shoutin'?

367
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,672
♪ Ho-ho-hum, zoot?

368
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,507
You remember.

369
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,742
Well, go through the streets
singing that song.

370
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,355
And little Turkey... I mean, Orville,
will hear you and reveal himself.

371
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,714
It might work.
It might work at that.

372
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:25,751
But look, Aunt Lucy, you being up there
and all, you must see everything.

373
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:29,455
Gee, you could save me a lot of trouble
if you just tell me where he is.

374
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:32,825
Oh, I'm not supposed to, Geoffrey.
It's against the rules.

375
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,660
Oh, come on, Aunt Lucy.

376
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:37,830
Gee, I won't crack to nobody.

377
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:41,734
Well, if you go to the marketplace,
then head east about 200 paces,

378
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:46,106
you'll come to... Oh, I can't talk
to you anymore now, Geoffrey.

379
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,773

Tell them who I am, Turkey.

Why, I never saw him

underhanded sickle-snoot!

00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:29,074
We were kids together in the same

00:28:35,515 --> 00:28:36,882

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,954
Come. Sit here beside me.

465
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,224
Well...

466
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:47,226
Now, Orville, I want you
to tell me the truth.

467
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,094
Do you know him?

468
00:28:49,128 --> 00:28:50,730
Well, I used to,
but I kinda outgrew him.

469
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:53,065
I don't dally much
with riffraff these days,

470
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,934
and he's a pretty
raffy kind of a riff.

471
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:57,202
Yeah. What...

472
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,972
Why didn't you tell me
you had a friend in Karameesh?

473
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:00,940
And such a friend.

474
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:03,242
Oh, so you didn't tell her
about me, huh?

475
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:05,887
Well, I didn't want to dicker too much.
It might've queered the deal.

476
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,880
This kid can't
handle competition.

477
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,915
You can understand why,
can't you, ma'am?

478
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:12,885
Yes, I can.
Here we have a proverb.

479
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:15,721
"A goose is beautiful
until it stands beside a peacock."

480
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:18,624
Say, goose...

481
00:29:18,658 --> 00:29:20,135
What are you made up for anyhow?
What is this?

482
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,027
Ladies' night in a Turkish
bath or something?

483
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:23,896
What time do you light up, Jack?

484
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,798
It might interest you
to know, buster,

485
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:27,242
that you're looking at the
future prince of Karameesh.

486
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,068
Who?
I'm gonna be a pasha,

487
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,145
with the accent on the "pash."

488
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:30,970
What?

489
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:33,205
We're going to be married on...

490
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,174
When is the big day,
dream thing?

491
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:36,809
When the moon,
in its last quarter,

492
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:38,978
silvers the blossoms
of the almond tree.

493
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:40,713
That's Tuesday night,
about 9:00.

494
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:43,182
Oh, drat! I shall be
listening to Hobby Lobby.

495
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:46,952
Say, how can a dream like you
go for a drip like this anyhow?

496
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:48,754
It is written in the stars.

497
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:51,657
I've been counseled
by Hyder Khan, the wise one,

498
00:29:51,691 --> 00:29:54,727
to take this man for my
husband, and I must obey.

499
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,964
Yeah, well, all I can say, old Hyder Khan
must've been out of focus at the time.

500
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:01,701
Oh, is that so? Well, the nuptial
knot's practically tied, see,

501
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:03,736
and there's nothing
you can do about it, see.

502
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:06,205
I'm her Heathcliff. She
bought me for 200 skins.

503
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,674
And it looks like I'm gonna
get your money's worth.

504
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:11,143
She bought you? Where did
she meet up with you?

505
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:12,353
She's the dame I told you about

506
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,346
in the gold box with the sticks.

507
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:18,117
Come on, baby. Give your little
princie a big kiss, king size.

508
00:30:26,626 --> 00:30:30,596
Now kiss him on the nose. See
if you can straighten that out!

509
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,297
Oh, my.

510
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,733
Well, this defeats me.

511
00:30:33,766 --> 00:30:35,043
I gotta give you
credit, though, Junior.

512
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:36,645
You certainly did
all right for yourself.

513
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:38,303
To show you there's
no hard feelings,

514
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,815
I'm gonna stick around
for the wedding.

515
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,106
I'll even give you away.

516
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,908
Oh, now, just a second.

517
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:44,820
You've already given me away.
Just because I hit the jackpot,

518
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:46,354
you wanna stick around
and pick up the nickels, huh?

519
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,113
Well, come on, blow
before I press a button

520
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:49,691
and have your head
served up in a cup and a saucer.

521
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:51,116
Oh, wait a minute.
Quit shoving,

522
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,861
or there'll be a roomful
of teeth around here.

523
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:54,987
Now, listen, I'm talking
nice to you,

524
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,590
but you'd better get out of here
before I forget that I'm the Prince.

525
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,227
Do that again.

526
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:06,632
He did it!

527
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:09,268
Gentlemen, please.

528
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:12,137
What is your name?

529
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:13,105
Geoffrey.

530
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:15,207
Geoffrey, I want you
to stay here with us.

531
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,142
Well, I think I could
be very happy here.

532
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:19,287
Oh, come on, honey. Daddy's tired
and it's getting near my bed time,

533
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:21,346
and I have to
catch up with my reading.

534
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,715
Good night, Geoffrey.

535
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:24,149
Good night.

536
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,341
Do it some more.
Do it some more.

537
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:50,976
Come on, bub, rub.

538
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,412
Why is the Princess
going to marry you, Orville?

539
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:56,315
She was to have married
Mullay Kasim, the desert sheik.

540
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:57,750
Why has she changed her mind?

541
00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:59,985
Oh, I guess sheiks
have gone out of style.

542
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:02,421
What the modern girl wants
is a nice, reliable wolf.

543
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:04,323
Do it some more.
Do it some more.

544
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:05,934
I'll get you time-and-a-half
for overtime.

545
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:08,260
There's something
very strange about it all.

546
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,429
Something very, very strange.

547
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:12,932
Yeah, it's
a strange country, baby.

548
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:15,100
Orville.

549
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:16,335
Huh?
Listen.

550
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:21,273
If this were known,
it would mean my death.

551
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:24,343
But in my heart,
there is a great love for you.

552
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:25,510
You, too?

553
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:28,748
Say, if this keeps up,
I'll have to buy myself a scooter.

554
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:33,819
Is my love hopeless, or do you perhaps
have some crumbs of affection for me?

555
00:32:33,853 --> 00:32:35,487
Oh, you know how a prince is.

556
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,891
I may set you up with a
little hat shop or something.

557
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:40,125
What a racket!

558
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:45,430
We're trying a new shade,
nightingale's blush.

559
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,867
Nightingale's blush,
that's sweet.

560
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,369
You get a complete
recondition and guaranteed job,

561
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:51,780
and you'll still look like a warthog.

562
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:54,774
Come on, gals, get a breath of fresh air.
Go ahead, beat it. Scat.

563
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,242
Just a second! I'm giving
the orders around here.

564
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:58,811
Besides, she's only done
nine toes.

565
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:00,379
Well, she can do
the other three later.

566
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:02,381
Go on, I want to put him
under the dryer. Beat it.

567
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:04,392
You'll bring on the rash. You'll spoil him.
Go on. Beat it.

568
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:07,419
Don't go far,
girls. I may need you.

569
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,325
Who are these Christmas tigers?
Who are they yessin'?

570
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:16,361
Well, the Princess' old man used
to use this for a courtroom.

571
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:18,530
He never lost a case.

572
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,365
That's very nice.
That's nifty.

573
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,402
Now, look, puffy, I want to have
a talk with you, man-to-man.

574
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:24,870
Yeah, who's gonna
hold up your end?

575
00:33:24,904 --> 00:33:26,081
I'll see you in a couple weeks.

576
00:33:26,105 --> 00:33:27,339
I have no time for riffraff.

577
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,141
You think you're pretty cute,
don't you?

578
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,886
Sending me that note they're
torturing you night and day.

579
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,453
Get out of town. There's
nothin' I can do for you.

580
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:35,347
That's right. There is nothing.
I can handle it all myself.

581
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,458
Now, look, buster, I want you to leave.
I know how you operate.

582
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:39,018
I don't want a best man.

583
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:40,519
You figure you'll move in, huh?

584
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:42,387
You figure maybe
you'll wind up the Prince.

585
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:43,856
Could be.
Could be.

586
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:45,166
Yeah, well, you're takin'
a powder, see,

587
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,430
and you're taking it right now.

588
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,893
That's gratitude, huh?
That's nice.

589
00:33:47,927 --> 00:33:50,571
You seem to be forgettin' that I'm
the guy that sold you into all this.

590
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:51,964
Now you want to toss me out.

591
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:53,065
Oh, don't give me that!

592
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:54,366
You thought you were selling me

593
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,468
into pickin' cotton with whips.

594
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:02,241
Yeah. Hey, now,
wait a minute. Hey!

595
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:04,209
Wait a minute. Where do
you think you're going?

596
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:05,344
What's in there?

597
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,012
Oh, it's nothing,
just milady's boudoir.

598
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:08,423
"Milady's boudoir"? What are
you doing going in there?

599
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:11,350
It's a strange country, chum.
It's a strange country.

600
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,252
Oh, find my friend,
Mr. Peters, a little corner

601
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:14,854
to sleep in over at the snake house.

602
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,321
You big phony.

603
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:17,833
Go ahead, buster. Get yourself
a rattle to play with.

604
00:34:17,857 --> 00:34:19,524
It's a nice parlay
from you to the snake.

605
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,427
Cuddle with a cobra.
Happy fangs!

606
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:26,465
Now wait a minute. You can't do this to me!

Okay, Ma, I'll get
a job tomorrow.

638
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,772
No, no, no. Wake up! Wake up!

639
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:55,340
What's the matter?

640
00:37:55,374 --> 00:37:57,542
The Princess is unfaithful.
She cares nothing for you.

641
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:58,819
Look, I'll see you
in the hat shop later.

642
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:00,379
No, listen!

643
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:02,047
At this moment,
she and your best friend

644
00:38:02,081 --> 00:38:03,758
are in each other's arms
in the gardens below.

645
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,184
Yeah, well, I...

646
00:38:05,217 --> 00:38:07,086
What?
Yes. Look.

647
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:11,623
Why, the lowdown, filthy,
double-crossing centipede!

648
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:12,991
Trying to climb into my shoes

649
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,336
and pull the roof in over his head!
That's what he's trying to do!

650
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,661
Why, the crawling lizard!

651
00:38:16,695 --> 00:38:19,164
I'll show him what a salami
has gotta go through.

652
00:38:19,198 --> 00:38:21,133
No, no, no. Don't waste
your anger upon them.

653
00:38:22,234 --> 00:38:24,503
Let us fly.
Let us fly together.

654
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:26,705
Okay, but let go
of my landing gear.

655
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:29,108
You and I, thus,

656
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:33,278
and thus... And thus will
my love consume you.

657
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:41,086
From manufacturer
direct to consumer.

658
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,054
I go!

659
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:44,856
Excuse me.

660
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,791
Beloved. Beloved!

661
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:49,228
Thus.

662
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:52,097
I...

663
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,170
Say, let me ask you something,
Princess.

664
00:38:58,203 --> 00:39:00,739
Suppose you, sort of, put off
this wedding for a little bit,

665
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:02,707
and I, sort of,
hung around a little bit,

666
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:03,708
and you grew
to like me a little bit,

667
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:05,744
wouldn't that change things
a little bit, huh?

668
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:07,746
No, Geoffrey, it would not.

669
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:10,815
I like you now.
The more I get to like you,

670
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,618
the more reason
I will have to marry Orville.

671
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:16,721
You like me so you're gonna
marry Orville.

672
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:19,158
Boy, that's a new kind of brush.

673
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,725
That is the way it must be.

674
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:23,328
There are many, many things
you don't understand.

675
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:25,230
Later you will know.

676
00:39:25,264 --> 00:39:26,607
Well, now, look, before you
figure on getting hooked up

677
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:27,842
to that chisel-chinned character,

678
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,710
I think there's a few things
you ought to know about him.

679
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,903
Why, Geoffrey, what do you mean?

680
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:33,838
Sit down a minute.

681
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:36,941
Just to give you an idea

682
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:39,311
of what kind of a double-crossin'
hoodlum he really is...

683
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:40,645
Did you know...

684
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:43,815
Oh, no. It's too fantastic.
You'd never believe it.

685
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,517
Go on, Geoffrey, what happened?

686
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,328
Well, we're broke,
see, and he sells me,

687
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:48,853
his best friend, for 200 bucks!

688
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,290
Practically gives me away.
Did you know that?

689
00:39:51,323 --> 00:39:52,691
I thought you sold him?

690
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,827
That's the way he tells it. There's
two sides to everything, you know.

691
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,929
But that's impossible. The
men brought Orville to me.

692
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:01,733
Don't you see, they come to pick
me up and get him by mistake.

693
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,302
But I don't understand...

694
00:40:03,335 --> 00:40:04,779
So you see, by rights, I
should be in his spot.

695
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:06,771
You should be marrying me
instead of him.

696
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:09,241
There's two sides
to everything, you know.

697
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,377
What's the big idea?

698
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:15,247
There's two sides
to everything, you know.

699
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:31,496
Princess! Princess, he's here.
Mullay Kasim, he's here!

700
00:40:43,342 --> 00:40:44,943
Mullay Kasim, my lord.

701
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:46,911
Where is he this...
This dog?

702
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,947
Hold your anger, Kasim.
Wait until you've heard...

703
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,582
I've already heard.

704
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:51,516
It's whispered
throughout the land

705
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,218
that on the very day
set for our wedding,

706
00:40:53,252 --> 00:40:55,887
you're planning to marry
this American!

707
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:59,458
Is it true? Tell me.

708
00:40:59,491 --> 00:41:02,494
Yes, Kasim, it is true.
But it is only because...

709
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:03,962
Enough!

710
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:06,331
Come, Ahmed Caspa.
Let us find this man.

711
00:41:06,365 --> 00:41:08,267
Let us see the color
of his liver.

712
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,969
Let us hang his filthy carcass
for the jackals to nibble at!

713
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:13,272
No, no, wait.

714
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:16,007
First you must hear the words
of Hyder Khan, the wise one.

715
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,978
Hyder Khan?
Very well, Shalmar.

716
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:24,316
Five more minutes does not matter
in the life of a cockroach. Come.

717
00:41:27,386 --> 00:41:31,323
And it is here, written in the
stars, O Lion of the Desert,

718
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:34,393
that the first husband
of the Princess Shalmar,

719
00:41:34,426 --> 00:41:38,363
will die a violent death within
the week of the marriage.

720
00:41:38,397 --> 00:41:39,864
What is that you say?

721
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:41,833
It is also written

722
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:46,805
that her second husband will be
blessed with long life and happiness.

723
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:50,275
Now do you understand?

724
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:53,545
The American, as my first husband,
will die within the week.

725
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:57,682
Then, as the wise one said, I will
be free to marry the man I love.

726
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,753
This is a great joke.

727
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:05,390
It'll be told and retold as
long as men live in Karameesh.

728
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:21,039
First time I ever saw
steam heat in print.

729
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:25,009
Orville?
Orville?

730
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:28,847
Just when it was
getting interesting.

731
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,749
Hello, hon.

732
00:42:30,782 --> 00:42:32,527
Did you tell Geoffrey he's
not to stay for the wedding?

733
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:34,052
That we didn't
want him here at all?

734
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:35,654
Well, I just hinted at it.

735
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:37,756
I gave him a map and
provisions for three months.

736
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:39,891
I can't understand
why you don't like him.

737
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:42,394
I think he's one of the
nicest men I've ever met.

738
00:42:42,427 --> 00:42:45,964
Oh, he's a nice fellow, as nice
fellows go and... Why don't he?

739
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:48,066
Orville, there's something
I must tell you.

740
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:50,702
You know, this is
a very strange country.

741
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:52,671
Yeah.

742
00:42:52,704 --> 00:42:55,039
Like you running into me and
buying me like I was a potato.

743
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:58,710
And me baked
ever since. Ho-hum.

744
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:04,048
No, I mean we have very strange
customs, very strange laws.

745
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:06,985
For the first week of a marriage,
a man and wife live separately.

746
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:09,521
Yeah, well, every...
Huh?

747
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:12,591
It is a custom
thousands of years old.

748
00:43:12,624 --> 00:43:16,094
Oh, little customs, you make 'em, you
break 'em, they come and they go.

749
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:17,896
Did I ever tell you
about Prohibition?

750
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,865
It has been so
for thousands of years.

751
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:22,834
There can be no other way.

752
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:25,704
Oh, honey, don't take on so.
It's only a week.

753
00:43:25,737 --> 00:43:27,606
Yes, only a week.

754
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:30,975
Oh, Orville, when I look at you
and think of our marriage,

755
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:32,811
I can't help crying.

756
00:43:33,845 --> 00:43:35,947
You're so young...

757
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,982
Much, much too young.

758
00:43:38,016 --> 00:43:40,785
Oh, you don't have to
worry about me, baby.

759
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:42,587
I just read a book.

760
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:57,736
Oso Bucco, come here!

761
00:43:58,503 --> 00:44:01,673
When was this American born?

762
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:04,743
I can't finish his tomb
until I have the date.

763
00:44:04,776 --> 00:44:06,077
I don't know, Ahmed.

764
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,046
We don't know what we're doing.

765
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:13,151
Another thing. I tell you we're
making his coffin too small.

766
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:15,920
I tried my wife
in it this morning.

767
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:17,789
Her feet were hanging out.

768
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,724
What are we going to do?
We're just guessing.

769
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:24,496
If we are not careful, we're
going to do a sloppy job.

770
00:44:24,529 --> 00:44:27,866
While the American is still alive,
why don't we measure him?

771
00:44:27,899 --> 00:44:30,869
Oh, we couldn't do that!
He would find out.

772
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:32,471
There are ways.

773
00:44:33,638 --> 00:44:36,741
There are ways!
Come on.

774
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:49,621
Right now I could use
a hole in my head.

775
00:44:57,729 --> 00:44:59,964
Could we disturb you, Master?

776
00:44:59,998 --> 00:45:01,766
Oh, sure, fellas,
what do you want?

777
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,470
If it is not too much trouble,
we would like to measure you.

778
00:45:05,504 --> 00:45:08,139
Yeah, what for?

779
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:11,910
We are making something for you.
It's a surprise.

780
00:45:11,943 --> 00:45:13,812
Oh! Something for the wedding.

781
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:17,816
No, Master.
This is for after the wedding.

782
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:19,984
Oh, sort of
a male trousseau, huh?

783
00:45:20,018 --> 00:45:22,787
Yes, Master, sort of
a male trousseau.

784
00:45:22,821 --> 00:45:24,264
Well, all right, fellas.
Go ahead. Measure away.

785
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:27,559
Thank you. Thank you, Master.
It will be brief.

786
00:45:27,592 --> 00:45:29,594
Waist, 34.
Waist, 34.

787
00:45:29,628 --> 00:45:32,139
So, you know, the Princess kind of has
an eye for beauty, so pretty me up.

788
00:45:32,163 --> 00:45:34,265
Sew in plenty of muscles.
Make it zooty.

789
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:37,702
Do not worry, Master. We will make you
look even better than you do now.

790
00:45:37,736 --> 00:45:38,870
Oh, thanks.

791
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,238
Chest normal, 41.

792
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:42,140
Chest normal, 41.

793
00:45:43,942 --> 00:45:45,744
Chest expanded, 41.

794
00:45:45,777 --> 00:45:47,111
Chest...

795
00:45:47,145 --> 00:45:49,113
Give me lots of room.
I like to spread out.

796
00:45:49,147 --> 00:45:51,249
Now, perhaps
the Master would lie down.

797
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:53,017
Oh, certainly.

798
00:45:56,755 --> 00:45:58,590
5' 11" overall.

799
00:45:58,623 --> 00:46:00,258
5' 11" overall.

800
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:02,260
Say, put a lot of padding
in it, will you, fellas?

801
00:46:02,293 --> 00:46:04,605
I want it nice and comfortable.
I don't want anything stiff.

802
00:46:04,629 --> 00:46:08,667
I assure you, Master. It will
be no stiffer than yourself.

803
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:12,637
Well, good day, Master.
Good day.

804
00:46:12,671 --> 00:46:14,138
Good day.

805
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:16,074
Good day.

806
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:20,178
Oh, one question, Master. What
is the date of your birth?

807
00:46:20,211 --> 00:46:24,015
Birth? What do you want that for?
What's that got to do with...

808
00:46:24,048 --> 00:46:25,850
It is for the record.

809
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:30,054
Oh! September 13th, 1913.
On a Friday.

810
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:32,957
Thank you, Master. We must go now.
We have to carve it on...

811
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:40,064
Carve it on?

812
00:46:40,098 --> 00:46:42,834
And what was that business?

813
00:46:43,835 --> 00:46:46,304
Orville?
Orville?

814
00:46:46,337 --> 00:46:48,139
Those two men.
What were they doing here?

815
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:50,050
Oh, they were measuring me
for some sort of outfit.

816
00:46:50,074 --> 00:46:51,910
Measuring you!
Do you know who they are?

817
00:46:51,943 --> 00:46:53,253
Well, I guess, they're
the royal dressmakers.

818
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:56,114
No, my beloved! No!
They're royal undertakers.

819
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:57,281
Yeah, well, that...

820
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:58,549
Huh?
Yes!

821
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:00,864
You mean, they were measuring
me for a graveyard gabardine?

822
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:05,523
Jeff! Jeff!
Okay, there you are.

823
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:07,868
I've been looking everywhere for you.
I got to have a talk with you.

824
00:47:07,892 --> 00:47:09,961
Now, look, Orvie, I've been
doing a lot of thinking.

825
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:12,072
There's no use of you and I
talking and arguing anymore.

826
00:47:12,096 --> 00:47:13,832
I'm gonna beat it on
out of here.

827
00:47:13,865 --> 00:47:15,242
No. That's it... You're not.
You don't have to.

828
00:47:15,266 --> 00:47:17,277
Oh, I admit I tried to cut in on you.
I made a big play.

829
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:19,680
But, whatever you've got,
that Shalmar's going through with it.

830
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:21,239
Now that's all been changed.

831
00:47:21,272 --> 00:47:22,340
Huh?
Well...

832
00:47:22,373 --> 00:47:24,175
I'm the guy that's shoving off.

833
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:26,678
I've been watching you two and
you're just made for each other.

834
00:47:26,711 --> 00:47:29,280
You look good together.
You're just the right size.

835
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:31,349
And, you're taking her.
See, I'm giving her to you.

836
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:33,918
Now, wait a minute.
What are you cooking up here?

837
00:47:33,952 --> 00:47:37,622
The last gal you gave me was that lady
wrestler up at the St. Nicholas rink.

838
00:47:37,656 --> 00:47:38,823
What's behind all this?

839
00:47:38,857 --> 00:47:41,192
Well, I got to thinking
about the burying...

840
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:43,237
I mean, the marrying, and I
got a hunch it wouldn't last.

841
00:47:43,261 --> 00:47:45,930
So, I got a feeling,
in a week, I'd be cold.

842
00:47:45,964 --> 00:47:48,366
And, besides, I got a girl.
I met mine.

843
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:49,977
I got her at the harem,
right off the assembly line.

844
00:47:50,001 --> 00:47:51,169
Nice model.

845
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:54,105
He's gonna fly with me.
My love will consume him thus...

846
00:47:54,138 --> 00:47:55,406
And thus, and thus...

847
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:57,208
Aunt Lucy?

848
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:59,410
You know, a girl
can eat too much yeast.

849
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:01,412
But, my very own...
Yeah, yeah, later.

850
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,858
You know, you gotta catch me when I'm
in the mood for that sort of thing.

851
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:05,650
You ain't been
out of it for 20 years.

852
00:48:05,684 --> 00:48:08,286
Well, this is a whole new shuffle, huh?
You two!

853
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:09,954
Wait till Shalmar
hears about this.

854
00:48:09,988 --> 00:48:11,398
Oh, yeah, but it's not
gonna be easy, you know.

855
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:14,101
It's gonna be a pretty tough assignment
to get Shalmar to give me up.

856
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:16,270
That'll be a struggle. But you can
handle it, old boy, I'm sure.

857
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:17,705
After all, you've got
everything I've got,

858
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:19,330
and you've had it
many years longer, too.

859
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,332
Yes, only, I got rid of mine.
Yeah, well, you...

860
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:24,111
It's gonna just really tear the heart
out of her to give you up, I guess.

861
00:48:24,135 --> 00:48:26,681
But I'll catch her sort of on the rebound.
She might settle for me.

862
00:48:26,705 --> 00:48:28,348
Yeah, well, that's the spirit
and I'll be right behind you.

863
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:30,284
I'm gonna see you right
through to the end, old pal.

864
00:48:30,308 --> 00:48:31,910
I will leave no stone unturned.

865
00:48:31,943 --> 00:48:34,112
My beloved!
Why don't we fly right away?

866
00:48:34,145 --> 00:48:36,290
Look, honey, why don't you just fly
around and warm your motor up?

867
00:48:36,314 --> 00:48:37,782
I'll join you later.

868
00:48:37,816 --> 00:48:39,684
Orville? Orville.

869
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,963
Orville!
Orville!

870
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:54,198
Orville, this is disgraceful!
Disgraceful!

871
00:48:57,101 --> 00:49:00,238
Orville, I'm not gonna let you do
this dreadful thing to Geoffrey.

872
00:49:01,906 --> 00:49:03,975
Oh, you'll be
the death of me yet.

873
00:49:04,008 --> 00:49:06,410
Please, Aunt Lucy!

874
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:07,722
You've got to talk
to him, Orville.

875
00:49:07,746 --> 00:49:09,347
You've got to
tell him the truth.

876
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,415
But, I ain't doing nothing.
Look what he did to me!

877
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:14,953
Orville, I insist.
If you don't tell him, I will.

878
00:49:14,986 --> 00:49:17,822
But, you can't talk to him.
You're in my dream.

879
00:49:17,856 --> 00:49:20,324
Oh, goodness, gracious me!
That's right.

880
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:22,460
We're only allowed to be
in one dream a week.

881
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:25,396
Mr. Jordan doesn't like us to
go around pestering people.

882
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,131
Well, I can understand that.

883
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:28,466
I've got to make him hear me.

884
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:31,970
Geoffrey! Geoffrey!

885
00:49:32,003 --> 00:49:35,273
Geoffrey!

886
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,308
Geoffrey!

887
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:42,446
Take your hands off me!
Stop it! No! Help!

888
00:49:47,118 --> 00:49:48,186
Guess that'll show her.

889
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:50,721
Your feet are cold.

890
00:49:52,857 --> 00:49:54,926
You see, Master.
Wings!

891
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:57,428
And more than that,
they have legs.

892
00:49:57,461 --> 00:50:00,364
Insects! Fireflies!

893
00:50:00,398 --> 00:50:03,467
By the heavens, what are
they doing in my telescope?

894
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:06,270
I don't know. I haven't cleaned
the lenses for a week.

895
00:50:06,304 --> 00:50:09,874
Dear, oh, dear!
Oh, dear!

896
00:50:09,908 --> 00:50:14,512
I must have mistaken these
fireflies for Jupiter and Venus.

897
00:50:14,545 --> 00:50:17,348
Oh, yes, Master, you've
certainly gummed up the works.

898
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,383
Indeed, I have.

899
00:50:19,417 --> 00:50:21,319
My prophesies for
the American's death

900
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:25,289
were based on the fixed
positions of Jupiter and Venus.

901
00:50:25,323 --> 00:50:27,025
I don't know.
This just doesn't add up.

902
00:50:27,058 --> 00:50:28,793
I want you, and you say
you want me,

903
00:50:28,827 --> 00:50:31,395
and Orville says it's okay,
and still you're gonna marry him.

904
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:34,465
I told you, Geoffrey.
It's something I can't explain.

905
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:37,401
Orville and I are going to be married
and that's all I have to say.

906
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:39,370
Well, I've got something
to say, too, see!

907
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:41,415
We're not suited, see. I'm not
in love with you anymore.

908
00:50:41,439 --> 00:50:42,841
I got another girl.

909
00:50:42,874 --> 00:50:44,909
No more talk.

910
00:50:44,943 --> 00:50:46,486
Go to your room
and prepare for the wedding.

911
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:49,948
I just got one thing
to tell you, Princess...

912
00:50:49,981 --> 00:50:52,150
I'm going to my room
and prepare for the wedding.

913
00:50:52,183 --> 00:50:54,552
Okay, fellas,
who's got the dice?

914
00:50:56,487 --> 00:50:59,290
Boy, he's a pip, isn't he?
Brushing off a dream like you.

915
00:50:59,323 --> 00:51:02,894
Instead of a wedding, you'd think
he was going to his own funeral.

916
00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:05,864
Yes... Wouldn't you?

917
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:07,966
Princess!
Princess!

918
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:10,534
Oh, mistress of my life,
listen and be merciful.

919
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,470
I have made a calamitous error.

920
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:14,939
You must not
marry that American.

921
00:51:14,973 --> 00:51:16,407
You must marry Mullay Kasim!

922
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,909
Mullay Kasim?

923
00:51:17,942 --> 00:51:19,086
Speak.
I must hear everything.

924
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,244
You see, my Princess,

925
00:51:20,278 --> 00:51:23,381
your life is influenced by the
planets Jupiter and Venus,

926
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:27,451
and so, it is my painful duty
to tell you what I've learned.

927
00:51:36,895 --> 00:51:39,630
You are indeed the favored
one of Allah, O Master.

928
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:43,567
For to marry the Princess, most men
in Karameesh would gladly die.

929
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:44,368
Yes.

930
00:51:44,402 --> 00:51:47,138
Yes.
That's what's worrying me.

931
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:49,908
So you see, they turned
out to be fireflies.

932
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:52,110
I was wrong about everything.

933
00:51:55,013 --> 00:51:56,314
Geoffrey!

934
00:51:58,649 --> 00:52:00,919
Geoffrey, don't you see?
Isn't it wonderful?

935
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:03,587
Oh, yes, it's pretty good. I
mean, what's wonderful about it?

936
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,489
It just means Turkey's
back in circulation,

937
00:52:05,523 --> 00:52:07,525
and you get tied up
to Mullay Kasim.

938
00:52:07,558 --> 00:52:08,826
Mullay Kasim.

939
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:12,496
Oh, Geoffrey, you may feel strange
about marrying a Princess,

940
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,366
but I'll spend the rest of my
life trying to live it down.

941
00:52:15,399 --> 00:52:17,635
You mean, me?

942
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:19,570
You mean, you and me?
Is that what you mean?

943
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:21,472
Mmm-hmm.
Mistress!

944
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:26,410
You see, Hyder Khan?

945
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:27,687
You see what your fireflies
have done?

946
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:31,950
Oh, how about this! Wait till I
break the news to doodlebug.

947
00:52:31,983 --> 00:52:36,020
So, that's why little Orville was so
anxious to hand you over to me, huh?

948
00:52:36,054 --> 00:52:38,522
I don't know how, but I think he
got wind of this whole thing.

949
00:52:38,556 --> 00:52:41,159
Well, don't say anything to him, Geoffrey.
Not just yet.

950
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:44,495
Don't you worry about me.
I'll handle him.

951
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:47,098
Yeah, you see, Shalmar and I
had a little talk, Orville,

952
00:52:47,131 --> 00:52:49,600
and we've decided
to accept your generous offer.

953
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,469
Generous offer.
What generous offer?

954
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:54,605
You giving me to her.
She's decided to accept me.

955
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:57,041
The guys are working
on the nuptial knots right now.

956
00:52:57,075 --> 00:52:58,176
No kidding!
That's right.

957
00:52:58,209 --> 00:52:59,944
Boy, I knew you'd see it.

958
00:52:59,978 --> 00:53:02,646
You two, what a pair!
Hand-in-hand!

959
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,562
Brother, you're gonna
have the happiest week.

960
00:53:04,773 --> 00:53:09,195
I mean, what a marriage! You're gonna
be in clover! Yes, sir, deep in clover.

961
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:13,224
Have you told me all?

962
00:53:13,257 --> 00:53:14,325
Oh, Sheik.

963
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:16,160
I have told you
what has befallen,

964
00:53:16,194 --> 00:53:18,929
trusting in your generosity
to reward me.

965
00:53:21,265 --> 00:53:23,001
Here.

966
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:24,535
You must hurry, O Mighty One!

967
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:26,404
When I left the palace,

968
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:29,707
the Princess and her consort
were preparing to leave the country.

969
00:53:49,427 --> 00:53:51,629
Hurry, hurry!
There isn't too much time.

970
00:53:51,662 --> 00:53:53,340
Hey, why don't you get some
sense into your noggin,

971
00:53:53,364 --> 00:53:55,166
and just you and me blow?

972
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:57,344
We're going to the United States
to get hooked up, I tell you.

973
00:53:57,368 --> 00:53:58,802
That's not gonna save your life.

974
00:53:58,836 --> 00:54:01,348
That guy, Hyder Khan's got that jinx
of his spread all over the world.

975
00:54:01,372 --> 00:54:04,508
Oh, yeah? Let's see him
mess around in Brooklyn.

976
00:54:13,451 --> 00:54:14,661
Here comes Murder, Incorporated.

977
00:54:14,685 --> 00:54:16,220
Call me later.

978
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:30,768
So, that is your plan!
Running away with this dog.

979
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:33,671
I could show a dog a few things
about running right now.

980
00:54:33,704 --> 00:54:35,539
I'm not mixed-up
in this at all.

981
00:54:35,573 --> 00:54:38,309
I just work here. I'm just
tending the gardens. I...

982
00:54:38,342 --> 00:54:40,744
My, these tulips need pruning.
Have one?

983
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,146
You lie to Kasim?

984
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:43,714
No, but it's a big switch now.

985
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:46,384
I gave her up. I'm on your side.
I'm your friend.

986
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:48,786
They're ducking out on you,
the dirty double-crossers!

987
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:52,323
What do you think
we ought to do with them?

988
00:54:52,356 --> 00:54:54,058
What is this?

989
00:54:58,229 --> 00:54:59,730
So, there's another one!

990
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:01,532
That's nice going, Junior.

991
00:55:01,565 --> 00:55:03,734
Remind me to throw you a piece
of cheese in the morning.

992
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:05,636
Kasim, I must say...
Silence!

993
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:09,740
Who is this goat? This moon-faced
son of a one-eyed donkey?

994
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:12,776
I wouldn't let him call me that
even if there is a resemblance.

995
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,246
Listen here, big boy. Where do
you come off cutting in here?

996
00:55:15,279 --> 00:55:17,315
Go on. Go play cops and
robbers someplace else!

997
00:55:17,348 --> 00:55:19,350
Beat it, scat, shoo!

998
00:55:19,383 --> 00:55:21,828
Go on, now you tell him. Go ahead, slap
his teeth out. I'll hold your coat.

999
00:55:21,852 --> 00:55:23,354
Well, I'll hold your coat, too.

1000
00:55:23,387 --> 00:55:25,423
Kasim, please.
Please!

1001
00:55:25,456 --> 00:55:28,726
Quiet! You would dare
oppose the will of Kasim?

1002
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:31,629
Oppose your will? I'll have you writing
one if you mess with me, Jack!

1003
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:33,507
Now, you're talking. Go ahead.
Take a poke at him.

1004
00:55:33,531 --> 00:55:35,766
We're not afraid
of him. Are you?

1005
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:38,136
Enough!
You are coming with me.

1006
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:39,746
Caspa, take one of the
girls for yourself.

1007
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:41,139
Now, just a minute here.

1008
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:42,673
Okay, pal, I'm with you.

1009
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:43,850
He says she's going with him.

1010
00:55:43,874 --> 00:55:45,776
Oh! She's going with him?

1011
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:47,511
He says she's going with him.

1012
00:55:47,545 --> 00:55:49,713
He make joke.
Funny boy.

1013
00:55:49,747 --> 00:55:52,483
♪ Patty cake, patty cake,
baker's man!

1014
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:53,851
♪ Bake a cake as...

1015
00:55:58,622 --> 00:56:01,759
Yes, sir, Junior!
That thing sure got around.

1016
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:02,860
Yeah, and back to us.

1017
00:56:04,362 --> 00:56:06,364
Run! Run for your lives!

1018
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:30,830
This way! Come on,
nipper, shake a slipper!

1019
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:33,191
Okay, lover, head for cover!

1020
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:36,394
Hurry!
Hurry!

1021
00:56:36,427 --> 00:56:39,897
Now, wait! You two girls
hide in there, quick! Hurry up!

1022
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,732
No, no, no!
Not you!

1023
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:43,301
We'll stay here
and hold them off.

1024
00:56:43,334 --> 00:56:44,802
Yeah, we'll hold them off.

1025
00:56:44,835 --> 00:56:47,405
Who, us? Who are you kidding?
Hold who off?

1026
00:56:47,438 --> 00:56:50,674
Let's spread out.

1027
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:54,312
Two of you, that way. Search the tower!
Search the palace!

1028
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:00,818
Two of you, in there.

1029
00:57:05,656 --> 00:57:07,458
Come on, now!
Search, you dogs! Search!

1030
00:57:07,491 --> 00:57:09,636
My white stallion to the man
who brings me their heads.

1031
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,462
Come on, now!

1032
00:57:11,495 --> 00:57:14,798
They must learn what it means to
incur the wrath of Mullay Kasim.

1033
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:16,934
They're not in here.

1034
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:18,712
There's no trace of them.
Searched everywhere.

1035
00:57:18,736 --> 00:57:20,079
Highness, we cannot
find them in here.

1036
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,773
They cannot be far. We must find
them and slit their throats.

1037
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:24,007
Yes, Your Highness!

1038
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:26,910
They shall die slowly. Their
tongues shall be ripped out!

1039
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:29,780
Their ears shall be sliced
off and dried on sticks.

1040
00:57:35,253 --> 00:57:38,256
Search the corridors! We'll find them
if we have to tear down the palace!

1041
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:39,857
Yes, Your Highness.

1042
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:28,065
Call the men!

1043
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:31,635
Stand up, you dog!

1044
00:59:31,669 --> 00:59:33,971
Oh, you thought you'd slip
through my fingers, huh?

1045
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:36,940
Caspa, after him!
Get the horses ready!

1046
00:59:38,676 --> 00:59:41,087
I was just going for a broom to
sweep this stuff up, that's all.

1047
00:59:41,111 --> 00:59:43,414
Mullay Kasim will take
care of you in the desert!

1048
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:46,550
Aunt Lucy!

1049
01:00:20,518 --> 01:00:23,554
I never thought I'd wind up
in a camel's snood!

1050
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:29,427
A fine pal you are,
letting me give her up!

1051
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:32,095
And all the time you knew
you weren't gonna die!

1052
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:34,998
That's what's killing me.
You weren't gonna die!

1053
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:36,900
Yeah, well, give me credit.

1054
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:39,803
That's pretty hard to do,
beating you and the embalmer.

1055
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:54,685
I feel like the morning mail.

1056
01:00:54,718 --> 01:00:56,454
RFD.

1057
01:00:56,487 --> 01:00:58,698
Look, they're leaving us! All
alone out here in the desert.

1058
01:00:58,722 --> 01:01:01,158
There's no food,
no water, no nothing!

1059
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:11,044
Well, come on.
Let's start the sack race.

1060
01:01:11,068 --> 01:01:12,002
Where do we go?

1061
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:14,204
Let's hop over the hill
and see what's doing.

1062
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:17,140
Must be a gas station
somewhere around here.

1063
01:01:27,618 --> 01:01:28,895
Say, what are you
still hopping for?

1064
01:01:28,919 --> 01:01:30,521
We've been out of
those nets all day.

1065
01:01:30,554 --> 01:01:32,756
I know, but I want to
keep my watch going.

1066
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:34,124
Say...

1067
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:38,061
How did we get loose with our hands
and feet tied and everything?

1068
01:01:38,095 --> 01:01:40,864
If we told anybody,
they'd never believe it.

1069
01:01:40,898 --> 01:01:42,866
Oh! Let's not
tell them, huh?

1070
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,835
Proceed.

1071
01:01:50,107 --> 01:01:52,209
See anything?
Nothing.

1072
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:54,077
Come on.
Courage, boy!

1073
01:01:54,111 --> 01:01:56,847
"Courage," he says.

1074
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,117
Look at that! You know what they
are, don't you? They're buzzards!

1075
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:03,587
Yeah. They're carrying
finger bowls, too.

1076
01:02:03,621 --> 01:02:06,490
Fine way to end up,
a box lunch for a bird.

1077
01:02:07,157 --> 01:02:08,659
Turkey, look!

1078
01:02:10,661 --> 01:02:12,839
Hey, what's a drive-in doing
in the middle of the desert?

1079
01:02:12,863 --> 01:02:14,498
I'm no quiz kid.
Come on, let's eat!

1080
01:02:14,532 --> 01:02:16,033
Well, I'll force something.

1081
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:21,071
Hey, toss us a couple
of mugs of java!

1082
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:22,706
We got our own sugar.

1083
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,008
Two tall double-dip hamburgers!

1084
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:26,209
Not too well done, please.

1085
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,646
And a couple of mile-high beers!

1086
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:30,781
Hey, it's moving!
We better grab it.

1087
01:02:30,814 --> 01:02:31,915
Hey, come back!

1088
01:02:31,949 --> 01:02:34,017
Wait a minute! Hey!
Hey!

1089
01:02:37,154 --> 01:02:39,657
Hey, what's this "now you see
it, now you don't" stuff?

1090
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:41,925
We might have known.
It's a mirage!

1091
01:02:41,959 --> 01:02:44,194
It sure was a good one.
I could even smell the onions.

1092
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:45,829
Come on!
I'm getting out of here.

1093
01:02:45,863 --> 01:02:47,197

Well, that's an omen.

save them from that wolf, Kasim.

I don't know whether I can make it.

much out of you, huh?

Yeah.

1129
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:35,132
Hey, come on!
Look! Water!

1130
01:05:35,165 --> 01:05:36,233
Water!

1131
01:05:44,074 --> 01:05:45,275
This is a bit of all right!

1132
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:46,443
How about this!
Well!

1133
01:05:46,476 --> 01:05:48,278
What are you doing?
My radiator's dry.

1134
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:50,814
One thing about it, where there's
water, there's life, people!

1135
01:05:50,848 --> 01:05:52,315
All we gotta do is
follow the stream.

1136
01:05:52,349 --> 01:05:54,184
Oh, there's a herring.
Come along, mister.

1137

Come along! Come along!
Come along!

1138
01:06:06,229 --> 01:06:07,297
What do you make of it?

1139
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:09,466
I don't know.

1140
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:10,977
We'd better take it easy until we
find out just whose joint it is, huh?

1141
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:13,036
It might be a camel motel.

1142
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:24,347
Hey, those guys! Those are
Mullay Kasim's gorillas!

1143
01:06:24,381 --> 01:06:27,450
Yeah, and that joint
must be their hideout, huh?

1144
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:29,495
Well, we gotta save the girls.
It's up to us now, Turkey.

1145
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:31,521
We'll have to storm the place.

1146
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:34,792
You storm.
I'll stay here and drizzle.

1147
01:06:34,825 --> 01:06:36,426
I got something that can't miss!

1148
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:37,360
So have they. Guns!

1149
01:06:37,394 --> 01:06:39,797
Now, look. Now, listen
to every word, see.

1150
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:40,907
We don't have to
wait for night, see.

1151
01:06:40,931 --> 01:06:42,365
We just go up
on the place and we...

1152
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:52,575
There's no one.

1153
01:06:52,609 --> 01:06:55,212
I tell you, there were two
men in the horse lines.

1154
01:06:55,245 --> 01:06:56,389
When they ran away,
I shot at them.

1155
01:06:56,413 --> 01:06:59,282
Ah! You've been
drinking koolash again!

1156
01:07:07,124 --> 01:07:08,434
Do you think they know we're here?

1157
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:10,393
We're still wearing
our heads, aren't we?

1158
01:07:10,427 --> 01:07:11,604
That was the dopiest idea
I've ever heard.

1159
01:07:11,628 --> 01:07:14,431
You thinking you could
skin a horse and put me inside.

1160
01:07:14,464 --> 01:07:16,366
How would I look being a horse?

1161
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:18,301
Just the same.

1162
01:07:18,335 --> 01:07:19,913
Look, we gotta get back to where we
started from and wait till dark.

1163
01:07:19,937 --> 01:07:21,104
Let's go.
Okay.

1164
01:07:44,461 --> 01:07:47,430
I think we just went
through a red light.

1165
01:07:51,068 --> 01:07:52,311
I'd feel better
if we had a periscope.

1166
01:07:52,335 --> 01:07:54,513
Will you trust me? Now, I've got
a great sense of direction.

1167
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:56,039
Go right.

1168
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:09,319
You think we're still okay?

1169
01:08:09,352 --> 01:08:11,955
Sure, sure. We were
headed due north.

1170
01:08:11,989 --> 01:08:13,823
North, huh?
Yeah.

1171
01:08:15,325 --> 01:08:19,062
Don't look now, Junior,
but I think we're standing on a rug.

1172
01:08:31,174 --> 01:08:32,542
It is those pigs!
Orville!

1173
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:35,645
Geoffrey, Orville! Don't stand there!
Hurry, run!

1174
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:38,415
Take them outside and
bring me back their ears.

1175
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:40,150
No, wait!

1176
01:08:40,183 --> 01:08:42,953
There must be no shedding of
blood on our wedding night.

1177
01:08:42,986 --> 01:08:45,422
Hey! Did you hear that?
"Wedding."

1178
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:47,257
I stopped listening
when he said, "blood."

1179
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:48,458
Lock them up!

1180
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:50,460
Look out!
I just had this pressed!

1181
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:52,562
Let's not be vulgar, bully!

1182
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:58,501
A fine thing. First you
sell me for 200 bucks,

1183
01:08:58,535 --> 01:09:01,171
then I'm gonna marry the
Princess, then you cut in on me!

1184
01:09:01,204 --> 01:09:02,681
Then we're carried off
by a desert sheik,

1185
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:04,283
now we're gonna have
our heads chopped off.

1186
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:05,642
I know all that.

1187
01:09:05,675 --> 01:09:08,021
Yeah, but the people who came in
the middle of the picture don't!

1188
01:09:08,045 --> 01:09:10,213
You mean, they missed my song?

1189
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:19,222
Who's that?
Who are they?

1190
01:09:19,256 --> 01:09:22,125
That's the great sheik
Neb Jolla and his men.

1191
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:23,260
Friend of Kasim's?

1192
01:09:23,293 --> 01:09:25,328
No, the enemy of Kasim.

1193
01:09:25,362 --> 01:09:27,464
For 10 years,
they have been at war,

1194
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:30,033
but tonight, Kasim has
invited him to his wedding

1195
01:09:30,067 --> 01:09:32,069
as a token of peace.

1196
01:09:32,102 --> 01:09:34,637
But I do not trust
either one of them.

1197
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:37,240
Halt!

1198
01:09:37,274 --> 01:09:39,209
You ought to take something
for your throat.

1199
01:09:39,242 --> 01:09:40,677
What have you got there?

1200
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:43,580
I've brought food for these men.
They have not eaten.

1201
01:09:43,613 --> 01:09:47,050
It cannot matter when it is
their last night to live.

1202
01:09:47,084 --> 01:09:50,053
Very well. Give it to
them through the window.

1203
01:09:51,121 --> 01:09:52,289
Any word from the governor?

1204
01:09:53,623 --> 01:09:54,757
Now, listen carefully.

1205
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:57,027
In this bowl there's a magic
ring from the Princess.

1206
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:58,628
With it, you can make
three wishes.

1207
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:00,073
Perhaps it will
help us all to escape.

1208
01:10:00,097 --> 01:10:03,066
Oh, what good is a ring? Why didn't
you bake us a cake with a file in it?

1209
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:05,668
The ring will not work
for everybody.

1210
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:09,639
If we are fortunate, it might
work for you, Geoffrey.

1211
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:10,873
Should it fail,

1212
01:10:10,907 --> 01:10:14,644
lift the jewel and inside you
will find poison, for two.

1213
01:10:16,746 --> 01:10:18,615
Here.
What is this talking?

1214
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:21,484
Go on, be gone!

1215
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:25,622
Goodbye, honey.
Don't forget to write.

1216
01:10:25,655 --> 01:10:28,625
Just send it to the Dead
Letter Office. Poison.

1217
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:36,533
Three wishes.
All right, start the acka-muracas.

1218
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:38,235
Come on, ring.
Oh, you ring.

1219
01:10:38,268 --> 01:10:40,737
Come on.
Get the four of us out of here.

1220
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,375
Magic ring.
What does she think we are?

1221
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:48,078
A couple of chowderheads?

1222
01:10:48,111 --> 01:10:49,746
No pictures, huh?
Nothing.

1223
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:52,415
Well, get the poison pills.
Let's get it over with, huh?

1224
01:10:52,449 --> 01:10:54,617
Oh, in here, huh?
There they are.

1225
01:10:54,651 --> 01:10:57,187
Yeah.

1226
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:59,632
Close your eyes, pal, and I'll shoot
you one of these concentrated mickeys.

1227
01:10:59,656 --> 01:11:01,634
Wait. Wait. What's the matter
with me shooting them to you?

1228
01:11:01,658 --> 01:11:03,402
Well, you don't want to fall and
get a big knot on your head.

1229
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:04,603
I gotta stay behind
and hold you up.

1230
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:06,696
No, no. I'll stay behind
and hold you up.

1231
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:08,631
On me, huh?
Yeah.

1232
01:11:08,665 --> 01:11:11,034
Don't let me fall too hard.
Oh, no.

1233
01:11:12,669 --> 01:11:16,273
Set the table, Aunt Lucy.
There'll be two more for dinner.

1234
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,409
Boy, I sure wish I had a drink.

1235
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:23,080
Junior! Junior, it worked!

1236
01:11:23,113 --> 01:11:25,682
How about that? The magic
ring, it worked on you.

1237
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:27,784
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle!

1238
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:43,333
Jeff, I'm back! Jeff, I did it!
I'm back!

1239
01:11:43,366 --> 01:11:45,344
Boy! For a minute, I thought
I only had a one-way ticket!

1240
01:11:45,368 --> 01:11:47,504
Hey, hey!
Cut it out!

1241
01:11:47,537 --> 01:11:49,306
What am I doing, huh?

1242
01:11:49,339 --> 01:11:50,783
You know, I think I liked
you better the other way.

1243
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:52,609
Yeah, well...

1244
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:55,645
Well, you've used up our last wish.
We'll never get out of here.

1245
01:11:55,678 --> 01:11:57,780
Oh, stop worrying.
I'll think of something.

1246
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,449
That's what I'm afraid of.

1247
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:01,184
What's going on here?

1248
01:12:01,218 --> 01:12:03,586
Oh, nothing. Say, did anybody
ever escape from this jail?

1249
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:06,156
Once, about a year ago,
two men got out.

1250
01:12:06,189 --> 01:12:08,691
Oh, yeah? Tell me, chum,
how'd they do it?

1251
01:12:08,725 --> 01:12:10,760
It was an accident.

1252
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:13,239
To light a cigarette, I placed my
rifle in the window like this.

1253
01:12:13,263 --> 01:12:15,365
Hello.
Oh, interesting.

1254
01:12:15,398 --> 01:12:16,733
And then what happened?

1255
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:18,311
One of the fellows reached
through the window,

1256
01:12:18,335 --> 01:12:19,845
grabbed the rifle
and pointed it at me.

1257
01:12:19,869 --> 01:12:21,738
Oh, you mean, like this?

1258
01:12:21,771 --> 01:12:24,707
Exactly! Except that he put
it right up against my head.

1259
01:12:24,741 --> 01:12:26,709
You mean, like this.

1260
01:12:26,743 --> 01:12:28,545
Yes! Yes!
What's wrong?

1261
01:12:28,578 --> 01:12:29,846
Put them up!
What?

1262
01:12:29,879 --> 01:12:31,324
You heard me!
Come on, give us those keys!

1263
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:32,882
Hurry, or we'll spread you.

1264
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:35,518
Ahmed, we have done it again!

1265
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:45,788
Say, I don't get this setup.
What's frying?

1266
01:13:45,822 --> 01:13:47,424
I'm cooking up
some small sabotage here.

1267
01:13:47,457 --> 01:13:50,436
We'll have them at one another's throats
in no time. A little internal dissension.

1268
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:53,463
Oh, I get it. Divide and conquer.
Brother against brother.

1269
01:13:53,496 --> 01:13:54,773
Yeah.
Sort of an Arabian Gestapo?

1270
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:57,867
You've got it, Tyrone.
Hasn't missed yet.

1271
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:00,370
Then we grab
the gals and cut out.

1272
01:14:00,403 --> 01:14:01,614
Here, hold this a minute,
will you?

1273
01:14:01,638 --> 01:14:02,839
Allez!

1274
01:14:14,251 --> 01:14:15,361
What are you gonna do with that?

1275
01:14:15,385 --> 01:14:16,953
Look and learn.

1276
01:14:24,861 --> 01:14:26,429
Hey, what are doing?
Making reefers?

1277
01:14:26,463 --> 01:14:28,598
This'll give them that lift.

1278
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,234
I got a pip.

1279
01:15:01,063 --> 01:15:03,032
What now?

1280
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:05,868
Brilliant! Good boy.
Where's the dribble-glass?

1281
01:15:05,902 --> 01:15:08,371
Here. Slip them
the drip, drip.

1282
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:32,595
Neb Jolla, so great is my joy tonight
that I wish to share it with you.

1283
01:15:32,629 --> 01:15:35,465
May our tribes live together
in peace for 1,000 years!

1284
01:15:35,498 --> 01:15:37,434
My hand on that, Kasim.

1285
01:15:37,467 --> 01:15:41,003
You are fortunate indeed to win the
love of so beautiful a princess.

1286
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:44,307
She cannot wait
for my kisses upon her lips.

1287
01:15:44,341 --> 01:15:46,343
Can you, my dove?

1288
01:15:46,376 --> 01:15:49,512
Kasim, you shall soon know
how I feel about you.

1289
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,515
There, you hear?
Yeah.

1290
01:15:59,656 --> 01:16:02,959
I drink to my friend
who was my enemy,

1291
01:16:02,992 --> 01:16:05,895
and to the eternal peace
that has come between us.

1292
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,068
I drink to that,

1293
01:16:12,101 --> 01:16:15,071
and also to the beauty
of my bride-to-be.

1294
01:16:26,983 --> 01:16:29,686
My apologies, O Great Sheik.
It's an accident.

1295
01:16:29,719 --> 01:16:30,929
There must be
a hole in the goblet.

1296
01:16:30,953 --> 01:16:32,722
Yes, I see there is!

1297
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:34,824
I trust you do not do this as a joke?
Do you?

1298
01:16:34,857 --> 01:16:37,627
No, my friend,
my very dear friend!

1299
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:40,897
Happy Fourth of July.

1300
01:17:04,654 --> 01:17:08,491
Kasim, what is the meaning of this?
What's going on here?

1301
01:17:08,525 --> 01:17:10,860
My friend, I give you
my assurances.

1302
01:17:10,893 --> 01:17:12,862
Eat, drink, music!

1303
01:17:12,895 --> 01:17:14,664
Let us all be like brothers.

1304
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:26,709
Do you bring us here to
make fools of us? Do you?

1305
01:17:26,743 --> 01:17:28,611
I tell you, this is
no doing of mine.

1306
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:30,447
Be of good faith.
There will be no more.

1307
01:17:34,951 --> 01:17:38,521
Kasim, when will
these outrages cease?

1308
01:17:38,555 --> 01:17:40,590
Neb Jolla, please, patience.

1309
01:17:40,623 --> 01:17:44,160
I humble myself
at your feet in apology.

1310
01:17:44,193 --> 01:17:45,995
Come, come, sit down.

1311
01:17:47,897 --> 01:17:50,833
This is the screwiest picture
I was ever in!

1312
01:18:18,828 --> 01:18:21,607
At the word from our master, for these
insults, we would tear you to shreds!

1313
01:18:21,631 --> 01:18:24,066
But, believe us. We are
as mystified as you.

1314
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:26,035
We came here to eat,
not to be mystified!

1315
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:27,637
That's right.

1316
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:33,242
Do not trust him.

1317
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:36,112
His is an empty
gesture of friendship.

1318
01:18:48,024 --> 01:18:50,226
Neb Jolla, I am at a loss
to understand!

1319
01:18:50,259 --> 01:18:52,662
Kasim, why do you persist on
playing these pranks?

1320
01:18:52,695 --> 01:18:55,965
It's just as much a surprise
to us, as it is to you.

1321
01:18:55,998 --> 01:18:57,700
Please forget about
the whole thing.

1322
01:18:57,734 --> 01:18:59,144
Your Highness,
I give you my assurance...

1323
01:18:59,168 --> 01:19:02,104
I am trying to control myself,

1324
01:19:02,138 --> 01:19:04,774
but my patience cannot last!

1325
01:19:04,807 --> 01:19:05,842
Neb Jolla, I tell you...

1326
01:19:12,181 --> 01:19:14,083
I'm on fire!

1327
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:15,217
Water, water!

1328
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:16,953
I am on fire!

1329
01:19:18,588 --> 01:19:21,223
Enough, enough!
This is war!

1330
01:19:29,065 --> 01:19:30,266
Fire! Fire!

1331
01:19:32,602 --> 01:19:34,503
This means war!

1332
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:56,659
When I see how
silly people behave,

1333
01:19:56,693 --> 01:19:59,128
I'm glad I'm a camel.

1334
01:19:59,161 --> 01:20:01,831
Oh, I'm glad you're a
camel, too, Mabel!

1335
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:24,286
Hurry up!

1336
01:20:25,722 --> 01:20:28,090
Let's go! Come on.
I'll race you!

1337
01:20:41,838 --> 01:20:44,874
You know, this thing pinches me a little.
You got another one?

1338
01:20:44,907 --> 01:20:46,809
Yeah.

1339
01:20:46,843 --> 01:20:48,253
It won't be long before we're
seeing little old New York.

1340
01:20:48,277 --> 01:20:50,179
Three long years we've
been waiting to get back.

1341
01:20:50,212 --> 01:20:52,390
Yep! I'm gonna grab a piece of
the good old USA and eat it.

1342
01:20:52,414 --> 01:20:54,316
Something down
around New Orleans.

1343
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:56,986
You know, Geoffrey,
I get the strangest feeling

1344
01:20:57,019 --> 01:20:59,188
that we've been through
all of this before.

1345
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:01,090
Looks like I trapped you again.

1346
01:21:01,123 --> 01:21:03,035
And, get me! This time I'm
bringing home the bacon, too.

1347
01:21:03,059 --> 01:21:04,193
And what a slab!

1348
01:21:04,226 --> 01:21:06,028
Orville!
Then the answer's yes?

1349
01:21:06,062 --> 01:21:08,064
Yes, but don't think I'm
marrying you for her money.

1350
01:21:08,097 --> 01:21:09,799
Why are you marrying me?

1351
01:21:09,832 --> 01:21:11,734
I'll think of something.

1352
01:21:11,768 --> 01:21:13,245
Say, I want the Statue of
Liberty to be proud of me,

1353
01:21:13,269 --> 01:21:16,205
so I think I'll powder my nose.

1354
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:17,206
I don't think it'll help.

1355
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:20,076
♪ Moonlight becomes you

1356
01:21:20,109 --> 01:21:22,344
♪ It goes with your hair

1357
01:21:37,894 --> 01:21:40,296
I can't go on!

1358
01:21:40,329 --> 01:21:44,033
No food, no water!
It's all my fault.

1359
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:46,803
We're done for.
It's got me!

1360
01:21:46,836 --> 01:21:49,906
I can't stand it!
No food, no nothing!

1361
01:21:49,939 --> 01:21:51,841
No food, no water!

1362
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:53,642
No food!

1363
01:21:56,779 --> 01:21:58,781
What's the matter
with you, anyway?

1364
01:21:58,815 --> 01:22:01,383
There's New York. We'll be
picked up in a few minutes!

1365
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:03,219
You had to open your big mouth

1366
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:05,321
and ruin the only good scene
I got in the picture.

1367
01:22:05,354 --> 01:22:07,289
I might have won
an Academy Award!
