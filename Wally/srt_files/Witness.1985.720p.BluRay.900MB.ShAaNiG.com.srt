1
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,030
Jacob was a good farmer.

2
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,255
- None better.
- But not the man to buy a horse for you.

3
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,258
Hochleitner, wasn't it your father
sold him the horse...

4
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,284
with a ruptured testicle?

5
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,539
He told him it was a bee sting
that made him limp that way.

6
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:52,384
That horse had one good ball,
that's all it takes.

7
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,750
Rachel...

8
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,248
I'm sorry about Jacob.

9
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,551
I know he will walk with God.

10
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,091
Thank you, Daniel.

11
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,050
- She'll be here.
- I hope so.

12
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,928
Daniel.

13
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,722
So, first time to the big city?

14
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,392
You'll see so many things.

15
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,895
Close your eyes.

16
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,446
Open.

17
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,787
Samuel, careful!

18
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,087
You come back soon.

19
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,752
Samuel!

20
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,437
And you be careful
out among the English.

21
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,802
Mama, look!

22
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,370
He's a cute little Amish boy.

23
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,362
Isn't he cute? I think so.

24
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,905
We have tickets to Baltimore.
Where is that train, please?

25
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,377
It's delayed three hours...

26
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,588
you'll hear it announced
when it's time to board.

27
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,340
- Take a seat right over there.
- But I-

28
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,550
Just take a seat.
I have to wait on these people.

29
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,917
- Yes, sir.
- There?

30
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,382
Mama, look, what's that thing?

31
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,614
Don't go far, Samuel.

32
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,072
Mama?

33
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,445
It's over there.

34
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,662
Samuel.

35
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,150
Hey. man!

36
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,608
What the fuck you doing, man?

37
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,078
- Washing my hands, man.
- What?

38
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,869
- Let's get out of here.
- Hold tight.

39
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,431
I already did that.

40
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,146
Just checking again.

41
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,748
Move these people back,
they shouldn't be this close.

42
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,917
Get Schaeffer on the phone,
get him down here, now.

43
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,390
Right.

44
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,226
- Precherd, who found the body?
- Right over there, sir.

45
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,093
How you doing, pop?
You found the body?

46
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,564
Not me, daddy, I just reported it.
It was the kid.

47
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,431
- What kid?
- How the hell do I know what kid?

48
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,597
It was the kid
in the funny black threads. Over there.

49
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,596
Thanks, pop.

50
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,936
How's he doing?

51
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,107
I'm a police officer, ma'am.
I have to talk to the boy.

52
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,946
What's your name?

53
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,285
Samuel.

54
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,615
- Samuel Lapp.
- And he's your son?

55
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,762
We were on our way to Baltimore.

56
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,460
My sister is expecting us.
Soon our train is leaving.

57
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,958
We'll get you on another train.

58
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,962
Sam, the man who was killed tonight...

59
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:29,637
was a policeman, and it's my job
to find out what happened.

60
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:35,062
I want you to tell me everything you saw
when you went in the bathroom.

61
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,036
There were two.

62
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,233
- There were two men?
- I only saw one.

63
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,792
Does anybody know about this?

64
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:49,378
No, nobody's had a chance
to talk to him.

65
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,326
What did he look like?
The man that you saw.

66
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,553
He was like him.

67
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,830
He was a black man?
He had black skin?

68
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,340
<i>But not schtumpig.</i>

69
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,562
<i>Schtumpig? What's schtumpig?</i>

70
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,147
On a farm,
when a pig is born small like that...

71
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,969
<i>he's schtumpig.</i>

72
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:12,926
A runt.

73
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,689
So, he wasn't a runt.

74
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,644
He was a big guy, like me?

75
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,687
Big guy.

76
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:28,542
<i>Subject is armed. He's wanted
for the stabbing deaths of a narcotic...</i>

77
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,460
I should have been there, John.

78
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,452
I told you.

79
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,842
That's not the point. That's the risk.

80
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,845
Undercover, one mistake,
bang, they kill you-

81
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,871
Where are you taking us?

82
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,882
I'm sorry.

83
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,269
We're looking for a suspect.

84
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,188
We got reason to believe
he's still in the neighbourhood.

85
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,190
I want the little boy
to take a look at him.

86
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,637
You have no right to keep us here.

87
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:59,226
Yes, I do. Your son
is a material witness to a homicide.

88
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,726
You don't understand.
We want nothing to do with your laws.

89
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,402
Doesn't surprise me.

90
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,903
A lot of people I meet are like that.

91
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,080
What did he say?

92
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,747
He asked who you are. Your name.

93
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:24,748
I told him we didn't need
to know anything about you.

94
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,753
Book. John Book.

95
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,928
Hey, man, where're you hiding?

96
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,791
Have a seat.
Young blood, where're you going?

97
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,434
Looking good, T-Bone.

98
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,476
- Hey, man, how're you doing?
- What the fuck?

99
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:29,487
- I'll sue you, man!
- Gotta get his arm. Let's get his arm.

100
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,823
Is this the man, Sam? Is this him?

101
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,825
You sure?

102
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,996
- Back off.
- You listen to me.

103
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,299
I want no further part of this,
nor does my son.

104
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,668
Okay. Get back in the car.

105
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,834
Honest mistake, all right.

106
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,650
John, what are we gonna do with them?

107
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,652
- What?
- A hotel or what?

108
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,988
Put them in a hotel,
they won't be there in the morning.

109
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:06,357
- I'll have to send to Baltimore for them.
- Well, what?

110
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,686
I got it.

111
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,584
This is my sister, Elaine.
This is Mrs Lapp and Samuel.

112
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,420
Where do you want them, Elaine?
The back bedroom, blue room?

113
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,822
Yeah, sure. The blue room.

114
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,867
- Can I help you with something?
- No.

115
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,873
Right back there, Sam. It's in the back.

116
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,933
How could you do this to me tonight?

117
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,459
It's important.

118
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:37,221
Just keep going straight through,
there's a folding cot for your son.

119
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,557
He turned on the light, good.

120
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,197
I told you I had company.

121
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,064
- Where's Jason and Billy?
- Upstairs, asleep.

122
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:49,326
You got a man in the house
and the kids are upstairs?

123
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,729
That's none of your business. So keep
your holier-than-thou mouth shut.

124
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,707
- Anyway, they like Fred.
- Fred? Now we got a Fred.

125
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,735
- Who are these orphans, anyway?
- They're Amish.

126
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,586
- Everything okay?
- Yes. Thank you.

127
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,260
<i>- John says you're Amish.
- Yes.</i>

128
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,434
Do we have to stay here?

129
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,734
No, we don't. Just for the night.

130
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,942
Say Your prayers.

131
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,953
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi, Bob.

132
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,002
When can we leave the city?

133
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:57,297
<i>I'm trying to get this over with
as quick as I can, then you can go.</i>

134
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:58,645
Good.

135
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:02,107
Samuel's probably going to have to
come back and testify. I'm sorry.

136
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,633
No, you're not, you're glad.

137
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,351
- Glad?
- Because now you have a witness.

138
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,015
Yeah, now I got a witness.

139
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:12,688
I just don't like my son spending all
his time with a man who carries a gun...

140
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,687
- and goes around whacking people.
- Whacking?

141
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,696
Come here, kiddo.

142
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,616
Big guy.

143
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:30,163
Now, don't be frightened. You can
see them, but they can't see you.

144
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:33,834
I want the hats and the sunglasses off.
Straighten up.

145
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,876
I want you to tell me
if any of these men...

146
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:42,881
are the man that you saw
in the bathroom. Take your time.

147
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,224
Look real carefully.

148
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,559
Make sure.

149
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,645
Are you sure?

150
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,902
Okay.

151
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,696
Three dogs to stay.

152
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,912
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

153
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:17,085
- These, we call Wurst.
- Sure.

154
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,458
Your sister said you don't have a family.

155
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,457
No, I don't.

156
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,801
She thinks that you ought to get
married and have children of your own...

157
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:06,263
- instead of trying to be a father to hers.
- Oh, yeah?

158
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:10,092
Except she thinks
you're afraid of the responsibility.

159
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:15,272
That's interesting, anything else?

160
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:17,690
Yeah.

161
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:22,654
She said that
she thinks that you like policing...

162
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,958
because you think
you're right about everything...

163
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:27,669
and that you're the only one
who can do anything.

164
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,445
And that...

165
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,991
when you drink a lot of beer,
you say things like:

166
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:37,666
"None of the other police know
a crook...

167
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:41,002
"from a bag of elbows."

168
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,962
I believe that's what she said.

169
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,800
Good appetite.

170
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,698
Captain.

171
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,152
- Yeah?
- Sgt Carter for you on Line 23.

172
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,412
Thanks.

173
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,871
How are you doing?

174
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,086
- I don't know.
- Little boy.

175
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,297
Look, he's shy.

176
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,003
Hey! Knock it off.

177
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,381
Knock it off!

178
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,501
I'll get it.

179
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,086
- Hi.
- Hi, Kathy.

180
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,005
Dad!

181
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,053
- Hello, Marilyn.
- Hi, John.

182
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,907
It's McFee, Paul.
He's one of them, anyway.

183
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,354
Positive ID from the Amish kid.

184
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,360
McFee? Lieutenant Narcotics?

185
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,446
Right.

186
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,536
I hope you don't have
any doubt about that.

187
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,577
It all fits, Paul. Four years ago...

188
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:46,202
Narcotics runs a raid
in which, amongst other things...

189
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,580
550 gallons of this P-2-P stuff
is confiscated.

190
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,878
They put it in Police Storage.

191
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,420
Philadelphia supplies all the
major cities in the country with speed.

192
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:59,399
They need this P-2-P stuff
to make the speed.

193
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:02,393
They pay up to $5,000 a pint for it.

194
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,594
I call Police Storage...

195
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,724
no record of 1055-gallon drums
of P-2-P.

196
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,435
That's $22 million, Paul.

197
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,530
Guess who ran the raid four years ago?

198
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:17,821
- McFee.
- Right.

199
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:23,034
- Have you talked to him about it?
- No. On vacation, Florida.

200
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,884
All right,
what do you need to clean this up?

201
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,053
People from outside the department.

202
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:32,557
Put some guys on this McFee,
watch him, wait him out.

203
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:36,185
Right. FBI or maybe somebody
from Treasury. I'll take care of that.

204
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,813
I want maximum security on this.
Where's the boy?

205
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,023
<i>At my sister's house.</i>

206
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,817
He's going to have to be moved.
Who else knows about this?

207
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,014
- Just you and I.
- Let's leave it that way.

208
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,128
Twila, get back!

209
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,075
Police! Back in the elevator!

210
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,176
That's our car!

211
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,053
- Get in the elevator!
- I don't give a shit.

212
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,262
You idiot!

213
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,754
Get down!

214
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:02,963
I know you, asshole!

215
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,725
- It's John. Says you have to leave now.
- What?

216
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,593
He says it's urgent. I don't know.
Get dressed quickly.

217
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:47,015
John!

218
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,437
Put my car in the garage
and close the door.

219
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,198
John, I don't understand any of this.

220
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,475
You don't know anything. Okay?

221
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,940
I borrowed your car. All right?
I didn't say why.

222
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,279
You never heard of that woman
and her boy.

223
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,532
John, please tell me why.

224
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,048
Just do it.

225
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,551
You said we would be safe
in Philadelphia.

226
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:14,997
Well, I was wrong.

227
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,837
Did you deliver the kid's interview
to Schaeffer?

228
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:28,014
No.

229
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:32,361
I want all the paperwork
on this job disappeared tonight...

230
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,557
you understand?

231
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,813
John, do you know
what you're telling me to do?

232
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,524
Just do it, man.

233
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,162
I'm going to disappear
for a couple of days.

234
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,188
John, what's going on, man?
What is happening?

235
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,875
I'll call you when I can.

236
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:49,073
And, partner, watch your back.

237
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,996
Schaeffe's in this thing, too.

238
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,072
- Shit!
- What're you doing?

239
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:17,643
Working late, man.

240
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:20,438
What's going on?

241
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:28,867
That's it.

242
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,132
Hey, Fergie?

243
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,215
Told you I hit him.

244
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,860
He's in trouble. I want to help him.
I want you to help him.

245
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,363
- We need to know where he is.
- What kind of trouble?

246
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,699
It's a departmental matter,
you don't have to worry about it.

247
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:01,867
If we can just talk to him,
we can straighten it out.

248
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,661
- A departmental matter?
- Right.

249
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,663
You're saying he's involved
in something illegal?

250
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,155
I'm afraid so.

251
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:11,043
Anybody who knows John
knows that's a goddamn lie.

252
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:14,046
<i>Of course it is, Elaine.
But as long as there's any doubt...</i>

253
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,591
it's better that John
should come in and clear his name.

254
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,494
It's better you should
get off my property.

255
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:23,171
I don't want to have to take you in
for questioning.

256
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:25,962
He left with the Amish woman, right?

257
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,633
- She say where he is?
- I don't think she knows.

258
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,843
- What about Carter?
- Tight.

259
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,349
But I'm working on him.

260
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,463
Samuel!

261
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,209
<i>Opa.</i>

262
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,937
You should rest.

263
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,908
I'll make us some coffee.

264
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,605
No, I can't stay.

265
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:40,953
Will you be coming back
to take Samuel to trial?

266
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,789
There isn't going to be any trial.

267
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:46,913
Rachel?

268
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:52,382
What happened? Who was that man?

269
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,528
Mama.

270
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,326
John?

271
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,391
My God,
why didn't you get to a hospital?

272
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:31,792
No doctor.

273
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,591
Gunshot wound,
they have to make a report...

274
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,423
and if they make a report, they find me...

275
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:40,846
and if they find me, they find the boy.

276
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,114
- Is the English dead?
- No.

277
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:04,700
Looks dead.

278
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,560
Come.

279
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,567
He's upstairs.

280
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,595
I feel burning.

281
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:08,097
The bullet entered there...

282
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,391
and came out there.

283
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,649
There's danger of infection.

284
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:19,199
He's lost a great deal of blood.
I'm not a doctor.

285
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,618
This man should be treated
in a hospital.

286
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,405
- There's nothing I can do for him.
- No.

287
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,741
No. He must stay here.

288
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,578
What if he dies?

289
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:35,266
Then the Sheriff will come here.
They'll say we broke their laws.

290
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,476
But then we must pray that
he doesn't die...

291
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,646
but if he does, then we must find a way,
so no one knows.

292
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,774
But, Rachel, this is a man's life.
We hold it in our hands.

293
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:44,970
I know that.

294
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:49,096
God help me, I know that, Eli.
But I'll tell you if he's found...

295
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:52,649
the people who did this to him
will come get Samuel.

296
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,071
Then make a poultice.

297
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,951
Three parts milk, two parts linseed oil,
for the infection.

298
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:07,201
I will send Mary by with some teas
I will brew myself.

299
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,416
Thank you.

300
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,389
Lapp, I'll have to speak with the elders
on this matter.

301
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,345
As you see fit.

302
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:58,350
You shouldn't.

303
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,522
Don't do it.

304
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:02,604
I'll fucking kill you.

305
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:04,860
You asshole.

306
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,954
He's the one...

307
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:25,918
John?

308
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:19,856
Are you trying to tell me that there's
no way we can locate this woman?

309
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:23,494
We're talking about 20th century
law enforcement, Sergeant.

310
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:26,413
<i>Well, there's your problem, Chief.
Your Amish man doesn't live...</i>

311
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,999
<i>in the 20th century,
doesn't think in the 20th century.</i>

312
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,126
<i>Chief, if the Amish have taken
your man in...</i>

313
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,088
<i>I wouldn't want to hang from a rope
until you find him.</i>

314
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:37,912
The problem is, about every third
Amish man around here is named Lapp.

315
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:41,095
<i>And we've got upwards
of 14,000 Amish men around here.</i>

316
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,516
<i>- That's just Lancaster County. Over in-
- Very interesting, Sergeant...</i>

317
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,089
but this is a very important matter.

318
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:51,130
It involves the murder of a police officer.

319
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:54,983
Now, there must be a directory of some
sort of these people somewhere.

320
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:59,154
Sure. Tax rolls, voter registration,
but tell you right now...

321
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:02,282
I don't have the manpower
to send a deputy to every Lapp farm...

322
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,993
<i>in Lancaster County
to see if they've got your Rachel.</i>

323
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,996
Maybe, Sergeant,
you could do a little telephoning?

324
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,738
Yeah, maybe I could.

325
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,655
But since the Amish don't have any
telephones, I wouldn't know who to call.

326
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:19,703
Thank you, Sergeant.
It's been an education.

327
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,263
Who are they?

328
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,741
The leadership of our district.

329
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,689
They decided to come see you
for themselves.

330
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,445
Except Stoltzfus.

331
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,405
He came the first day.

332
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:54,738
- I think he saved your life.
- No, that was not I.

333
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:00,119
- Who else knows I'm here?
- No one.

334
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,927
How long have I been here?

335
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,248
Two days.

336
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:10,963
Rest, Mr Book, that's the ticket.

337
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:14,550
And drink my tea, lots of my tea.

338
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:28,285
Tell him his tea stinks.

339
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,732
You can tell him when you're able.

340
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:40,464
We're all very happy
that you're going to live, John Book.

341
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:44,334
We didn't know what we were
going to do with you if you died.

342
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:57,472
It's not our place
to ask how he came to us.

343
00:45:57,964 --> 00:46:00,342
<i>He'll leave as soon as he's able.</i>

344
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,216
Don't move!

345
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,185
What are you doing?

346
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,017
Come here.

347
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,737
Come here, Samuel. Sit down.

348
00:46:57,565 --> 00:47:01,411
This is a loaded gun.
This is very dangerous.

349
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,867
Never, ever...

350
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,707
touch a loaded gun.

351
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:12,209
Now I'm taking the bullets out,
now it's safe. Okay?

352
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,499
Okay, Mr Book.

353
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,005
Look, call me John.

354
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:20,230
I just don't want you to get hurt.

355
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:23,233
I don't mean to yell at you.
I just don't want you to get hurt.

356
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:27,683
Look, it's all right for you to look
at it now, it's unloaded. It's safe.

357
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:31,074
You want to handle it,
you can handle it while I'm here...

358
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:34,648
but that, that's not right.

359
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:49,417
Samuel, wait for me downstairs.

360
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:58,126
John Book, while you're in this house,
I insist that you respect our ways.

361
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,422
Right.

362
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,674
Here, take it.

363
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:05,849
Put it somewhere where it's safe.
Where he won't find it.

364
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:24,452
This gun of the hand
is for the taking of human life.

365
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:28,956
We believe it is wrong to take life.

366
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,125
That is only for God.

367
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:36,839
Many times the wars have come...

368
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:40,885
and people have said to us...

369
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:44,343
you must fight, you must kill.

370
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:47,683
It is the only way to preserve the good.

371
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,224
But, Samuel...

372
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:56,150
there is never only one way.
Remember that.

373
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:01,072
Would you kill another man?

374
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:04,821
I would only kill a bad man.

375
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,037
Only the bad man, I see.

376
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:12,659
And you know these bad men by sight?

377
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:17,714
You are able to look into their hearts
and see this badness?

378
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:21,709
I can see what they do.

379
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,257
I have seen it.

380
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:29,554
And having seen, you've become
one of them. Don't you understand?

381
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:34,522
What you take into your hands...

382
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,438
you take into your heart.

383
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:43,907
"Wherefore come out
from among them...

384
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,067
"and be ye separate...

385
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,694
"saith the Lord...

386
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:54,409
"and touch not the unclean thing."

387
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,755
Go and finish your chores now.

388
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:01,587
Yes, Grandfather.

389
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,893
- Enjoying your reading?
- Oh, yeah.

390
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,984
Learning a lot about manure.

391
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:22,566
Very interesting.

392
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,777
What's that?

393
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:32,589
Your clothes are stained with blood.

394
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:35,366
I have them soaking.
You can wear these.

395
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:39,712
- They your husband's?
- Yes.

396
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:44,351
It's good that someone
can have the use of them.

397
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:47,845
Besides, in your clothes,
you'd stand out to strangers.

398
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:57,681
I should tell you that this kind of coat
doesn't have buttons.

399
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:59,115
See?

400
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:02,285
- Hooks and eyes.
- Something wrong with buttons?

401
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,061
<i>Buttons are hochmut.</i>

402
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:06,906
Proud, vain, it's not plain.

403
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,410
Got anything against zippers?

404
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,701
You making fun of me?

405
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,370
No.

406
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,167
Like the tourists.

407
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:26,213
Staring all the time.

408
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:32,340
Sometimes they come into the yard.
It's very rude.

409
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:38,604
- They seem to think we're quaint.
- Can't imagine why they'd think that.

410
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:43,059
Look, is there a phone
somewhere near?

411
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:47,613
The Gunter's across the valley.

412
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:50,917
They're Mennonites.
They have cars and refrigerators.

413
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:54,036
No, I mean a pay phone, a public phone.

414
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,280
The store at Strasburg...

415
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,954
but you won't be going to Strasburg
for a while.

416
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,541
I'm going this morning.

417
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:06,632
- But Stoltzfus said that you can't-
- Yeah, I know what he said.

418
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,884
You can go with Eli.

419
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:15,804
He's taking Samuel to school.

420
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:18,936
- But you'd better hurry.
- Rachel...

421
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:23,975
Nothing.

422
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,505
What?

423
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,755
Hurry up, John Book.

424
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,929
You'd better get going.

425
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,512
Hurry up, John Book.

426
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:04,814
My gun.

427
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,101
I need my gun.

428
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,205
Thanks.

429
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,792
The bullets?

430
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,799
It's not much good without them.

431
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,593
Of course.

432
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:45,064
Thank you.

433
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:55,073
How do I look? I mean, do I look Amish?

434
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,365
You look plain.

435
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:01,746
Okay.

436
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,698
He's an Englishman.

437
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,938
<i>- Carter here.
- Hey, partner, how you doing?</i>

438
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,056
<i>- You okay?
- Yeah.</i>

439
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,567
You?

440
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:06,029
Listen, man, I'm coming in
to take care of business. How hot am I?

441
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,270
Too hot.

442
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,648
Don't do it. Don't come in.

443
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,814
<i>- They're looking for you.
- And the kid.</i>

444
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:16,776
<i>- Man, I got to make a move.
- Listen, John, don't do it.</i>

445
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:20,418
You couldn't get
within a mile of Schaeffer right now.

446
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:21,910
You hear me?

447
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:26,248
- Yeah.
- What are we going to do?

448
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:27,999
FBI? What?

449
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,580
Maybe.

450
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,430
<i>Well, what about
one of those reporters?</i>

451
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:33,922
<i>Those investigative reporters?</i>

452
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:37,130
No, it's too risky.
They'd want to talk to the kid.

453
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,813
Listen, I'll make a couple of calls.

454
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:41,731
Let you know when maybe
you can come in.

455
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:45,476
- I got to go, take care of yourself.
- Yeah. You, too.

456
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:19,964
Here.

457
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:25,182
Don't put them in the peaches.

458
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:29,974
See this stream?

459
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:34,187
It goes to the wheel
and it makes the wheel turn around.

460
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:37,319
And then it goes, it makes...

461
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,150
this wire pump the pump...

462
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:45,327
over there, into the well...

463
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:48,997
and the well's water
goes into the house.

464
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:51,324
Yeah?

465
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:56,376
This place really echoes.

466
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,002
Hello!

467
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,835
- What's up there?
- Corn.

468
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:06,549
Would you like to hold my kitten?

469
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,893
I'll show you how to do a back rub
on him.

470
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,387
You hold them like that.

471
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:16,400
You push their head back,
and you start rubbing the neck.

472
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,033
Is that you, Book?

473
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,705
What you doing there?

474
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:42,209
Just trying to get the car started,
the battery.

475
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:44,799
If you are well enough to do that...

476
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:48,383
- you can do work for me.
- Yeah, what can I do?

477
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,386
- Milking, maybe.
- Milking'?

478
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,888
Cows, you know. Cows.

479
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,891
Yeah, I've seen pictures.

480
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,648
Good. You start tomorrow.

481
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,881
It's 4:30, time for milking.

482
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,366
Milking stool.

483
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:55,453
Milking hat. There's the milk.

484
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:08,421
Firm grip.
Pinch the top off and squeeze.

485
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,387
Didn't you hear me? Squeeze.

486
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,514
I am squeezing.

487
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:19,477
You never had you hands
on a teat before?

488
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,646
Not one this big.

489
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:34,154
I got it!

490
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:38,625
I think.

491
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:47,376
- Come on.
- Gently, gently.

492
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,378
Don't frighten her, Book!

493
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:54,516
Samuel, help him.

494
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:14,654
- No, please.
- Eat, Book.

495
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:17,507
What's the matter with your appetite?

496
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:20,009
I'm not used to eating
in the middle of the night.

497
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:23,583
Not used to hard work.
That's what makes appetite.

498
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:25,714
Rachel.

499
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,759
Samuel.

500
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:35,674
Honey, that's great coffee.

501
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,392
It's a joke.

502
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:45,943
It's a commercial on television.

503
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,541
- Book, is it?
- Yeah.

504
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:09,420
You are the Yankee they talk about.

505
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,394
I thought I was the English.

506
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:13,762
English, Yankee, it is the same.

507
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:17,595
My name is Daniel. Daniel Hochleitner.

508
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:19,930
How do you do?

509
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:26,520
You look plain, Book. Very plain.

510
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:32,068
I came to see Rachel.

511
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,688
Eli said I could use his tools.

512
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:58,241
I'm trying to fix that birdhouse.

513
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:08,543
- I brought you some lemonade.
- Oh, great.

514
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:20,050
Thanks.

515
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:30,353
- What happened to Hochleitner?
- He went home.

516
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:35,403
He's a friend of the family.
He's like a son to Eli.

517
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:42,448
- You know carpentry.
- Yeah.

518
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:46,785
- A bit.
- Can you do anything else?

519
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:53,751
Whacking. I'm hell at whacking.

520
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:57,876
Whacking is not much use on a farm.

521
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:06,927
Tomorrow I'll let out those trousers
for you.

522
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,221
Good.

523
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:22,109
I told Eli that you're a carpenter.

524
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:24,907
Hold this up closer, will you?

525
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:30,701
He said you could come
to Zook's barn raising.

526
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:33,787
Well, if I'm still here.

527
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:41,103
<i>Weenie roasts. I don't know anything
about weenie roasts.</i>

528
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:44,802
<i>That's a West Coast thing. Let's have
some letters on weenie roasts.</i>

529
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:48,476
<i>Presenting golden oldies.</i>

530
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:51,447
<i>We've got some great ones
and some old ones coming right up.</i>

531
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:53,974
<i>Here's one, takes me back,
I'm afraid to say it dates me.</i>

532
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:55,817
<i>Maybe it dates you.</i>

533
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:01,652
This is great. This is the best.

534
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:59,289
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

535
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,269
Rachel!

536
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:00,938
Rachel?

537
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:34,308
What is it with you?
Is this the Ordnung?

538
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:36,678
I have done nothing against
the rule of the Ordnung.

539
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:38,155
Nothing?

540
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:41,979
You bring this man to our house
with his gun of the hand.

541
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,186
You bring fear to this house.

542
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:48,524
Fear of English
with guns coming after him-

543
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:50,992
I've committed no sin.

544
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,820
Maybe. Maybe not yet.

545
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:56,456
But, Rachel, it does not look...

546
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:59,329
You know there has been talk.

547
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:03,459
Talk about going to the Bishop
and having you shunned.

548
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:05,214
That is idle talk.

549
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:07,675
Do not take it lightly. Rachel!

550
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:10,504
They can do it.

551
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:13,677
They can do it just like that.

552
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:18,011
You know what it means, shunning?

553
01:08:20,388 --> 01:08:22,732
I cannot sit at table with you.

554
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:25,856
I cannot take a thing from your hand.

555
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:29,530
I cannot go to worship with you.

556
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:32,192
Child...

557
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,032
do not go so far.

558
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:39,383
- I am not a child.
- But you are acting like one.

559
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:41,705
- I'll be the judge of that.
- No.

560
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:45,873
They will be the judge of that,
and so will I.

561
01:08:47,415 --> 01:08:51,045
- If you shame me...
- You shame yourself.

562
01:09:02,013 --> 01:09:04,391
Why don't you tell me where he is?

563
01:09:05,016 --> 01:09:06,768
You know, don't you?

564
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:13,445
I just want to talk to him.

565
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:17,404
I wanna talk some sense into him.

566
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:20,911
You know, we go way back.

567
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:24,369
John and I were a team once.

568
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:27,789
Like you two are now.

569
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:31,960
I trained him.

570
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:35,964
He's a fine policeman.

571
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:44,022
I know he's with the Amish.

572
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:49,978
God, I'd give anything to see him now.

573
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,033
Can you see John at a prayer meeting?

574
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,462
We're like the Amish.

575
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:11,796
We're a cult, too.

576
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:16,967
A club. With our own rules.

577
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:22,227
John has broken those rules.

578
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:26,518
As you're breaking them now.

579
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:05,011
I hear you're a carpenter.

580
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:08,407
Well, it's been a while.

581
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:11,025
No matter,
we can always use a good one.

582
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:15,568
Hurry up now. We have a barn to raise
and a day to do it.

583
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:25,873
Good luck.

584
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,204
Your hole is better now?

585
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:33,039
Yeah, it's pretty much healed.

586
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,714
Good, then you can go home.

587
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:53,225
Yes, sir.

588
01:16:57,446 --> 01:17:00,996
Everyone has an idea
about you and the Englishman, Book.

589
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:04,204
All of them charitable, I'm sure.

590
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:07,002
Hardly any of them.

591
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,151
Amos.

592
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:33,741
This is Lidia and Amos.

593
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:36,068
- John Book.
- Hello.

594
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:39,079
- Hello.
- It's their barn you built today.

595
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:41,248
- We just got married.
- Yeah?

596
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:44,585
That's great.

597
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:32,081
Rachel?

598
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:55,392
Rachel.

599
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:04,444
If we'd made love last night,
I'd have to stay.

600
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:09,452
Or you'd have to leave.

601
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:29,468
Get off the bus, everybody!

602
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:32,096
Welcome to Amish country.

603
01:21:32,471 --> 01:21:36,476
This is the most famous Amish
grocery store in the area.

604
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:38,870
Now, stay close together...

605
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,790
because we're only going to be here
another 15 minutes.

606
01:21:41,814 --> 01:21:45,043
Now, be careful with photographing
the Amish, they don't like it...

607
01:21:45,067 --> 01:21:47,616
but you can sneak one now and then.

608
01:21:47,778 --> 01:21:49,621
All right, stay together.

609
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:51,824
Young man!

610
01:21:51,949 --> 01:21:55,553
Hello, we're just here for the day,
would you mind if I took your picture?

611
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,671
Now just stand still.
Fix your hat a little-

612
01:21:57,788 --> 01:22:00,809
Lady, you take my picture,
I'm going to rip your brassiere off...

613
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:03,177
and strangle you with it.

614
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:04,677
You got that?

615
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:10,635
Did you hear
what that Amish just said to me?

616
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:14,312
- Homicide.
- Elton Carter.

617
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:17,558
<i>- Who's calling?
- A friend.</i>

618
01:22:20,519 --> 01:22:23,648
<i>Yeah, Salazar, Public Relations.
Can I help you?</i>

619
01:22:24,148 --> 01:22:27,493
Yeah, I'm trying to reach
Sgt Elton Carter.

620
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,195
<i>Are you a member of the family?</i>

621
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,493
What? No, I'm a friend.

622
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:36,928
<i>Then I regret to inform you
Sgt Carter is dead.</i>

623
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:38,138
What?

624
01:22:38,162 --> 01:22:40,849
<i>He died last night,
killed in the line of duty.</i>

625
01:22:40,873 --> 01:22:43,001
<i>Should you require other-</i>

626
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:10,110
Hello. Yes.

627
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:12,446
Paul!

628
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:18,126
It's John Book.

629
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:21,292
I'll take it in the study.

630
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,377
How are you, John?

631
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:36,432
Hello, John.

632
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:44,942
Calling me at home, I can't trace
the call. That's smart, John, very smart.

633
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:47,690
- Lost the meaning, didn't you, Paul?
- What?

634
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:51,402
<i>Isn't that what you used to say
about dirty cops?</i>

635
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:54,923
<i>Somewhere along the way,
they lost the meaning.</i>

636
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:58,885
Don't make it difficult, John.
We know where you are.

637
01:23:58,909 --> 01:24:01,458
- We're about to-
- No, you got it wrong, man.

638
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:05,003
- I'm coming to get you.
- I like your style, John.

639
01:24:05,499 --> 01:24:07,376
I've always liked your style.

640
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:10,104
I'm going to do to you
whatever you did to Zenovich...

641
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:11,773
and whatever you did to Carter.

642
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:14,926
I'm going to fucking do that to you, too,
you asshole.

643
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:33,378
Come on, you wrecked the fucking road.

644
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:35,746
- I can't take this up.
- Yeah.

645
01:24:35,862 --> 01:24:37,739
- Just give it a shot.
- Look.

646
01:24:37,864 --> 01:24:40,788
- No look. You look.
- It takes half hour to take back.

647
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,300
It happens sometimes. Do nothing.

648
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:53,589
I asked you to move this horse.

649
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:55,431
Come on!

650
01:24:55,674 --> 01:24:57,176
Come on, Goldilocks.

651
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:02,440
- Don't you speak English?
- You don't hear very good, do you?

652
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:13,576
- And the chin.
- You look better, buddy.

653
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:19,215
- Come on down, Jack.
- They are not allowed to fight.

654
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:20,383
You a man or what?

655
01:25:20,407 --> 01:25:24,178
That's right, no fighting.
They won't fight for their country either.

656
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:27,547
- It's not our way.
- But it's my way.

657
01:25:28,165 --> 01:25:30,018
Book, no!

658
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:33,216
- How does it look?
- It looks great, give it to me.

659
01:25:35,839 --> 01:25:39,594
Here comes another one, look at this.

660
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:42,812
It's all right, Book.

661
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:46,275
Watch it, Frankie,
he's gonna hit you with his Bible.

662
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:52,981
You're making a mistake.

663
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:10,673
Book.

664
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:16,721
Somebody give me a handkerchief,
he's bleeding.

665
01:26:31,478 --> 01:26:34,332
I've never seen anything like it
in all my years.

666
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:36,484
He is from Ohio, my cousin.

667
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:40,196
Well, then, them Ohio Amish
must be different.

668
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:44,746
Round here, the brethren don't have
anything like that kind of fight in them.

669
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:46,844
Good day to you, Mr Lapp.

670
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:49,389
This ain't good for the tourist trade,
you know.

671
01:26:49,413 --> 01:26:51,632
Tell that to your Ohio friend.

672
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:55,645
Broke his nose.

673
01:26:55,669 --> 01:26:57,888
He was with old Eli Lapp.

674
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:12,899
Where did you get that?

675
01:27:13,186 --> 01:27:14,904
Book gave it to me.

676
01:27:17,315 --> 01:27:19,738
He said it was a special present.

677
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:42,349
Samuel, time for bed.

678
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:49,940
You can take the toy with you.

679
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:14,419
He's leaving, isn't he?

680
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:17,297
Tomorrow morning.

681
01:28:18,877 --> 01:28:21,972
- He'll need his city clothes.
- But why?

682
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:25,359
What's he going back to? Nothing?

683
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:29,308
He's going back to his world,
where he belongs.

684
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:31,640
He knows it...

685
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:35,310
and you know it, too.

686
01:32:50,982 --> 01:32:53,656
It's all right, we're police officers.

687
01:32:54,152 --> 01:32:56,325
Check the rest of the house.

688
01:32:57,238 --> 01:32:59,707
It's all right, we're police officers.

689
01:33:00,742 --> 01:33:04,337
Philadelphia Police.
It's all right, Mrs Lapp.

690
01:33:05,997 --> 01:33:08,876
Why don't you sit down.
It's going to be all right.

691
01:33:09,042 --> 01:33:12,672
We're not going to harm your boy.
It's Book we want.

692
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:16,174
Now, where is he?

693
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:30,439
Book!

694
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:36,702
Fergie! Come on!

695
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:39,114
Come on, damn it.

696
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:54,049
What is it? What are they doing?

697
01:34:08,977 --> 01:34:11,956
Listen, Samuel,
I want you to go to Hochleitner's farm...

698
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:14,449
as fast as you can and stay there.
You understand me?

699
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:16,752
- Are they going to kill you?
- I'll be all right.

700
01:34:16,776 --> 01:34:18,904
But you don't have your gun.

701
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,499
Run, Samuel. Run!

702
01:34:44,179 --> 01:34:45,476
Shit!

703
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:07,035
Come on!

704
01:35:38,316 --> 01:35:39,659
Samuel!

705
01:39:25,751 --> 01:39:26,877
Fergie?

706
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:35,891
Fuck!

707
01:39:43,728 --> 01:39:44,900
McFee!

708
01:39:58,743 --> 01:39:59,915
Fergie!

709
01:40:17,887 --> 01:40:19,104
What's wrong?

710
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:21,937
- I can't figure it out.
- Where's Fergie?

711
01:40:22,058 --> 01:40:24,652
I don't know, you'd better come on up.

712
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,133
Come on, we're going outside.

713
01:41:07,144 --> 01:41:08,145
Come on!

714
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:00,873
Schaeffer!

715
01:42:30,895 --> 01:42:33,239
Stop the boy ringing that bell.

716
01:42:34,106 --> 01:42:36,918
I want you to stop the boy ringing that
bell. I want you to... Stop him now!

717
01:42:36,942 --> 01:42:38,694
Get out of here now!

718
01:42:47,703 --> 01:42:48,750
Let her go, Paul!

719
01:42:48,871 --> 01:42:51,391
- Put the gun down, Book!
- Let her go, Schaeffer!

720
01:42:51,415 --> 01:42:53,759
- I'll blow you away.
- Put that gun down.

721
01:42:53,918 --> 01:42:55,795
I'm gonna blow her head off!

722
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:57,593
It's down, the fucking gun is down!

723
01:42:57,713 --> 01:43:01,109
- You really fucked up now, you idiot!
- Let her go.

724
01:43:01,133 --> 01:43:02,760
Let her go, Paul. The gun's down!

725
01:43:02,885 --> 01:43:06,105
- Book, put that gun down!
- The gun's down!

726
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:09,400
It's down. Don't hurt her.

727
01:43:44,135 --> 01:43:47,309
It's all right, Rachel.

728
01:43:47,596 --> 01:43:49,644
Rachel, just go. Go.

729
01:43:59,483 --> 01:44:02,657
It's all right! I'm a police officer!

730
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:04,948
The man's wanted for murder.

731
01:44:05,114 --> 01:44:07,492
- Now stand back!
- What are you going to do, Paul?

732
01:44:07,616 --> 01:44:09,636
You going to kill me?
You going to shoot me'?

733
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:11,879
- You going to shoot him?
- Stand back!

734
01:44:11,996 --> 01:44:14,875
You going to shoot him?
Is that what you're going to do, Paul?

735
01:44:14,999 --> 01:44:16,672
Him, the woman, me?

736
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:28,684
It's over! Enough!

737
01:46:22,084 --> 01:46:23,802
Goodbye, John Book.

738
01:46:28,132 --> 01:46:29,634
Goodbye, Samuel.

739
01:48:22,871 --> 01:48:25,124
You be careful out among them English.
