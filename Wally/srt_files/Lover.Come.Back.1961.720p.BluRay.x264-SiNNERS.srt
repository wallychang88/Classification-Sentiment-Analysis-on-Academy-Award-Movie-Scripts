NARRATOR:
This is Madison Avenue,

3
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,901
nerve center of
the advertising world.

4
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,239
Here in these steel and concrete
beehives are born the ideas

5
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:40,910
that decide what we, the public,
will eat, drink, drive and smoke,

6
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,330
and how we will dress,
sleep, shave and smell.

7
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:51,379
In all beehives, there are
workers, and there are drones.

8
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,926
This is a worker.

9
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,427
Thank you.

10
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,148
And this is a drone.

11
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,733
Jerry, honey?

12
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,695
You're at work.
Hmm?

13
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,241
Good night, darling.

14
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,742
Good night.

15
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,619
Wait a minute.

16
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:27,790
What kind of a goodnight kiss is that?
We're not married!

18
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,844
My! What a way
to go to work!

19
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,471
Now that's a woman!

20
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,641
Make you homesick, Fred?

21
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,101
Yeah!

22
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,271
Makes me sick
we're going home next week.

23
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,649
Brackett, MacAlpin
and Gaines Advertising.

24
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,986
Yes, I'll give him the message.

25
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,279
Dorothy,
Mr. Brackett in yet?

26
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,655
No, he isn't.

27
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,619
Tell merchandizing, copy and art there'll
be a meeting in my office right away.

28
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:10,291
Miss Templeton wants merchandizing, copy,
and art in her office on the double.

29
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,585
Looks like a rough day.

30
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,053
Good morning,
Mr. Webster.

31
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,847
Good morning.

32
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:29,810
Would you send up tomato juice,
black coffee and a masseur?

33
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,228
Yes, sir.

34
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,984
Mr. Webster wants tomato juice,
black coffee and a masseur.

35
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,236
Looks like a rough night.

36
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:44,492
Miller's Wax is changing agencies and if
we work fast, we can get the account.

37
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:48,162
Now, Miller's coming into town tonight.
Find out where he's staying.

38
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,539
I want an appointment with him
first thing in the morning.

39
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,541
You can't work up
a presentation by then.

40
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,377
We can and we will.

41
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,464
Here's some thoughts I had. Type
them up for the meeting, okay?

42
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:02,301
And tell research I want a complete
rundown on J . Paxton Miller.

43
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:05,554
His packaging setup, distribution
setup, sales volume,

44
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,348
and strong and weak
market areas.

45
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:11,268
Well, Kelly, what's new this morning
in our gray flannel jungle?

46
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:12,895
The natives are restless.

47
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,108
J . Paxton Miller of Miller's Wax is due
in tonight to pick up a new agency.

48
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,734
The account's up for grabs.

49
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,195
Okay, let's start grabbing.
Where's he from?

50
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,072
Richmond, Virginia.

51
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,700
Get me a book on the Civil War.

52
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:29,787
And tell research I want a complete
rundown on J . Paxton Miller.

53
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,748
His family background.
Will his wife be with him?

54
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:37,211
What brand of liquor does he drink?
And what kind of girls does he like?

55
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,759
That's a very good idea.
Thank you.

56
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,178
Develop it further, Leonard.

57
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,180
And here.

58
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,851
This isn't bad, either.
But what color is that floor?

59
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,185
Lilac.

60
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,231
Lilac? Leonard, who has a
lilac floor in their kitchen?

61
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,483
I have.

62
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,111
Oh!

63
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:06,782
Well, Leonard, everyone isn't
as artistic as you are.

64
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:13,497
We have to sell this wax to
average, ordinary, everyday people.

65
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,624
Yeah, them.

of Miller's Wax from every angle,

67

Carl, I've photographed this can
of Miller's Wax from every angle,

68
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,132
with every kind of lighting but
I just can't make it look good.

69
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,013
Well, I think you may have hit on
the key to the whole thing, Harold.

70
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,348
This can. It's unattractive.

71
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,475
So?

72
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,727
So Leonard designs a new one.

73
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,854
When? It's 10:30.

74
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,815
We'll be here half the night! I live
clear the other end of the Bronx.

75
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,277
Believe me, the agency
that lands this account

76
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,531
is the one that shows Mr.
Miller the most attractive can.

78
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,712
Most attractive.

79
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,297
More bourbon, Mr. Miller?

80
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,007
Just a touch.

81
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,512
Yes, sir!
She's most attractive!

82

You know, I'd like to meet her.

83
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,432
You're going to.

rabbits... I mean girls, tonight.

85

Jefferson Davis, our great leader.

but my heart remains loyal

91
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,335
to the place of my birth.
Virginia.

He fell during Pickett's Charge.

Mine, too!

104
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:12,658
He was following that great and
gallant captain, Elijah E. Miller.

105

this is a hallowed moment.

for the party.

There was a party
in Mr. Miller's suite?

120

Not a party. The party!

Mr. Brackett, this man Webster is a

Mr. Brackett, this man Webster is a

This isn't the first account
he's taken away from us.

156
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:27,037
Then why don't you haul him up in
front of the Advertising Council

00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,498
and charge him
with unethical conduct?

And who do you think will testify?
Miller? The girls?

159
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,463
Besides, there's no law against
entertaining a client.

160
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:40,217
Well, there must be a law against
that kind of entertaining.

161
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,094

Mr. Brackett, surely you don't
condone Webster's methods?

166
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:01,738
Of course not!
No ethical agency does.

167
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:05,033

he get away with it?

he ruled with an iron hand.

I don't think young Ramsey
knows what's going on.

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,894
Mr. Brackett, there are two
ways to handle a cold,

177
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,647
you can fight it, or you can
give in and go to bed with it.

178
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,734
I intend to fight it!

179
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,868
Wait here.

180
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,745
Hey. Hey!

181
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,998
That's a cab zone.
Beat it, buddy.

182
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,000
I am not your buddy.

183
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,628
I happen to be Peter Ramsey.

184
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,380
I don't care if you're
Peter Rabbit. Beat it!

185
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,008
How would you like a fat lip?

186
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,259
Fine. Fine.

187
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,636
Harrison,

188
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,263
give him a fat lip!

189
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,725
Okay, so park there!

190
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,860
Hope Mr. Webster won't get angry. I've
never let a man into his apartment.

191
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,112
I assume full responsibility.

192
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,114
I am his employer.

193
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,014
All right, Mr. Webster.
Now hear this.

194
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,434
It has been brought
to my attention

195
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,772
that you are guilty of conduct unbecoming
an employee of Ramsey and Son.

196
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:02,985
You have embarked upon this course
without my knowledge or consent.

197
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,489
My father, the Commodore, would
not brook insubordination,

198
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,547
and now that the command
has passed to me,

199
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,535
by thunder, neither will I.

200
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:15,163
I demand a full and complete explanation
of these charges here and now,

201
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,999
or heads will roll.

202
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,961
Speak up, man. I'm waiting.

203
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,885
Do you realize
what you just broke?

204
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,847
My psychiatrist gave me that
to build up my confidence!

205
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,766
I ought to break your neck,
barging in on me like this.

206
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,561
Take it easy. Come on,
come on, come on!

207
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,105
I had a very rough morning.

208
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,525
Took a terrible tongue-lashing
from that Carol Templeton.

209
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,985
Who's that?

210
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:50,198
New account executive at
Brackett, MacAlpin and Gaines.

211
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,702
She accused you of pirating
the Miller Wax account.

212
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:57,122
She said you got Mr. Miller
tipsy and you got him a girl.

213
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,792
That's not true. I got him loaded
and there were seven girls.

214
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,337
Just a moment! Hey!

215
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:07,883
(WATER RUNNING)

216
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,552
I'm head of the company.

217
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,972
You're accountable to me,
do you hear?

218
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:18,435
I leave the bridge for five minutes
and you steer the ship on the rocks!

219
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,919
I demand to know if your conduct
has been in the best interest

220
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,731
of Ramsey and Son.

221
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:27,986
That's sadistic.

222
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:29,988
Now you listen to me.

223
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,867
I was up all night in the best
interest of Ramsey and Son.

224
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,996
I landed a $5,000,000 account in the
best interest of Ramsey and Son.

225
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,456
And as for you
leaving the bridge,

226
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,000
you haven't been in the
office for two months.

227
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:45,337
And that's in the best
interest of Ramsey and Son.

228
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:50,008
I have a very good reason
for not going into the office.

229
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,260
It depresses the employees.

230
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:57,182
I discussed it with my analyst, Dr.
Melnick. He understands it.

231
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,393
He says I depress him, too.

232
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,020
Yeah, he's only human.

233
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,355
Well, you should
feel sorry for me!

234
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,941
You don't know what a handicap
it is to be born rich.

235
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,859
Some handicap.
Don't sneer.

236
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,237
Wealthy people are
hated and resented.

237
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,114
Look what's written
on the Statue of Liberty.

238
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,573
Does it say,
"Send me your rich"?

239
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,075
No, it says,
"Send me your poor."

240
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,202
We're not even welcome
in our own country.

241
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,038
It's all very well for you to laugh!
You're one of the lucky ones.

242
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,708
You were born in the slums.
That's lucky?

243
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:27,087
Of course it is. You had everything
going for you. Poverty, squalor...

244
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:31,007
There was only one way for you to go.
Up. But I started at the top.

245
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,551
I've done it the hard way.

246
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:33,969
Done what?

247
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,723
Taken over the helm
of Ramsey and Son.

248
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,391
And as president,
I've a right to know

249
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,893
what's been going on
since I've taken over.

250
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:45,647
Well, I'll tell you.
I've landed ten new accounts.

251
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,942
There's a lot more to advertising
than just landing accounts.

252
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,611
The big job is
selling the product.

253
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:54,030
Give me a well-stacked dame
in a bathing suit,

254
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,074
and I'll sell aftershave
lotion to beatniks.

255
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:00,245
Girls again! What's this
obsession you have with girls?

256
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:04,124
I was a poor kid, remember? I
didn't have toys to play with.

257
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,419
See? I told you
it's a handicap to be rich.

258
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,298
Get me that green tie.
Right.

259
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:16,845
What about Miss Templeton?
What am I gonna say to her?

260
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:18,388
Nothing.

261
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:22,100
I'll say it for you.
Oh, good.

262
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:28,148
Tell her that we're very
sorry for what happened.

263
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:32,068
And that if she's willing
to forgive and forget,

264
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:35,363
why, that henceforth we will conduct
ourselves in a manner beyond reproach.

265
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,617
Carol Templeton, please.
Jerry Webster calling.

266
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:39,826
Ramsey and Son.

267
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,662
Assure her of our
high moral character.

268
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,248
Yes, Mr. Webster.

269
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,502
Mr. Ramsey here tells me
that you spoke to him.

270
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,587
And I'd like to ask you a favor.

271
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,131
Will you kindly keep your big,
fat nose out of my business?

272
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:54,424
No! No!

273
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,178
If the competition's too tough, get
out of the advertising profession.

274
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,348
You aren't even in
the advertising profession.

275
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:04,601
And if I weren't a lady, I'd tell
you what profession you are in.

276
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,812
Tell me anyway. Well,
let me put it this way.

277
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,523
I don't use sex
to land an account!

278
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,400
When do you use it?
I don't!

279
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,070
My condolences to your husband.

280
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,405
I'm not married.

281
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,407
That figures.

282
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,327
What do you mean "that figures"?

283
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,038
Well, a husband
would be competition.

284
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,999
There's only room
for one man in a family.

285
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:30,794
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Webster.

286
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,754
I wish I were a man right now!

287
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,340
Keep trying.
I think you'll make it.

288
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,554
Oh! Despicable!

289
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:51,147
Millie, get me the phone
number of a Miss Rebel Davis.

290
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,358
She works at the Bunny Club.

291
00:19:57,113 --> 00:20:00,282
Your trouble is you're still living
in the shadow of your father.

292
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,126
You're even afraid
to get rid of his old car.

293
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,286
You don't realize how
completely he dominated me,

294
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,830
ever since I was a little boy.

295
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,374
Just once, I spoke back to him.

296
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:14,004
He cut a switch from a tree
and gave me such a whipping...

297
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,464
In front of this girl.

298
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,467
(TELEPHONE RINGING) It was
a shattering experience.

299
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,470
Pete, all kids get whippings.

300
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:26,308
But I was 25.
The girl was my fiancée.

301
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:28,393
Hello?

302
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,771
REBEL: Hello, you no-good,
double-crossing, low-down liar!

303
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,566
Rebel, honey,
what's the trouble?

304
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,734
There's trouble?

305
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,570
You promised me I was gonna
be the Miller Wax girl,

306
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:42,115
and now Mr. Miller says
there ain't even gonna be one!

307
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,077
Carol Templeton
surely was right about you.

308
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,746
Carol Templeton?

309
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,915
Are we in trouble?

310
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,291
When did you talk to her?

311
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,417
Oh, never you mind.

312
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,377
She wants me to go to
the Advertising Council

313
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,504
and tell them about
those parties you throw.

314
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,214
And I'm gonna do it!

315
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:01,426
Don't you go near the Advertising Council!
I'll be right over.

316
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,929
We're in trouble, aren't we?
I can handle it.

317
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,347
Now, see here.
As head of the agency,

318
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,973
I have a right to know.
Are we in trouble?

319
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:08,892
Yes, we're in trouble.

320
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,102
You shouldn't have told me.

321
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,689
Jerry Webster,
you get out of here!

322
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,861
Now, honey,
let's talk this over.

323
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,948
I'll do my talking
to the Advertising Council!

324
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,449
Sugar lump.

325
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,243
I am not your sugar lump!

326
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,163
And stop nibbling on me.

327
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,792
You've been promising to put me
on television for two years.

328
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,378
Baby. Baby.

329
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,884
You are not gonna nibble
your way out of this one!

330
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:46,471
I'm gonna tell that
Advertising Council plenty!

331
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,226
Okay.

332
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,979
Go ahead, tell them.

333
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:58,233
There isn't going to be any Miller
Wax girl, but also tell them why.

334
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,110
Tell them how I canceled
when I found out

335
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,861
they were gonna hide
that glorious figure

336
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,186
under a long gingham housedress.

337
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,408
That's like hiding a Rembrandt
under a dishtowel.

338
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,705
Tell them everything.

339
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:16,084
Tell them how I turned down, for
two years, sponsor after sponsor,

340
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:20,005
looking for the right product.

341
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,842
The perfect product
for you to represent.

342
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,722
Tell them I finally found one.

343
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,271
What is it?

344
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,107
Something.

345
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,483
Would've made you more famous

346
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,688
than Miss Rheingold and the
Schweppes man put together.

347
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:44,404
Well, what is it?

348
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,615
A brand-new product.

349
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,660
It's different.

350
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:54,289
It's exciting.

351
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,708
What is it?

352
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,960
Well, it's...

353
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,051
VIP.

354
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,386
VIP?

355
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,891
I was going to make you
the VIP girl.

356
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,518
What's VIP?
VIP?

357
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:20,607
It's the product that would have
brought you fame and fortune.

358
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:24,652
The key that would have opened
the golden door to Hollywood.

359
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,530
And you turned it down.

360
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,450
No, I didn't!

361
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,995
Jerry! Jerry, wait.
Honey! Honey!

362
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,998
I didn't turn it down.
Same thing.

363
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,752
We're filming the VIP
commercials at 1:00.

364
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,462
I've got to pick out
another girl.

365
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,632
Oh, no, you don't!
I wanna be the VIP girl.

366
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,550
Forget it, you had your chance.

367
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:52,263
Oh, honey, please. Don't go. Come back.
Give me another chance.

368
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:55,642
I'll do anything you say.
Please!

369
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,478
Well, I...
Please.

370
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,315
Well, all right.

371
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:05,860
It's him!

372
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:12,158
Let's face it, Charlie. Either
you've got it or you haven't.

373
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,327
He's got it.

374
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,623
VIP commercial, number 3.

375
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,752
Okay, Rebel, action.

376
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:28,675
Hi there, I'm the VIP girl.

377
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,221
Everything I've got,

378
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,723
I owe to VIP.

379
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,563
I'm just a slave to any man
who uses VIP.

380
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,231
(EXCLAIMS)

381
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:49,946
Good things have been happening
to me since I discovered VIP.

382
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:55,535
I got my man when I got VIP.

383
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:02,792
Oh, yes, folks,
everything I got...

384
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,880
I owe to VIP.

385
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:09,799
(CLICKING TONGUE)

386
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:11,968
Cut. Okay,
Rebel, that's it.

387
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,304
Wrap it up.
Thanks, Bob.

388
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,973
What do you want done with these
commercials, Mr. Webster?

389
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,309
Put them on the shelf.
On the shelf?

390
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:23,980
Call me about it later, will you?
Rebel, you were fabulous.

391
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,941
Do you think they'll
like me on television?

392
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:31,529
Honey, single-handed. You may
bring in the 40-inch screen.

393
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,616
When are they going to be on?

394
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,367
Well, I...

395
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,537
I haven't got the deal
locked up yet.

396
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:42,582
But as soon as the sponsor
sees you, it's in the bag.

397
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,293
Now hurry and get dressed. You're
due at the Ad Council at 3:00.

398
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,128
But I don't want to
testify against you.

399
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:49,672
Don't worry, you won't.

400
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:51,549
But they'll ask me questions.

401
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:54,385
Here are the answers.
Memorize this.

402
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,430
And wear this around your neck.

403
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,516
Couldn't I just not show up?

404
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:01,684
(CHUCKLES)

405
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:05,021
That won't stop Templeton.
But this will.

406
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:09,317
And don't worry, honey. I'll
tell you every move to make.

407
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,530
Wait, what is this?
"Veritas et..."

408
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:18,660
Veritas et robitas super omnia.

409
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,704
That's Latin. That means,

410
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:26,167
truth and honor, above all.

411
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,420
You say
that's Mr. Webster's motto?

412
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:32,131
That's the code
by which he lives.

413
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,301
Many is the night
he's walked me to my door,

414
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:39,764
bowed, kissed my hand
and said, "Rebel,

415
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:45,103
"Veritas et robitas
super omnia."

416
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,273
This is ridiculous!

417
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:51,859
Miss Templeton, will you please
stop challenging your own witness?

418
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:55,905
Obviously, she has been coached.
Or bribed.

419
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:57,907
He gave you something,
didn't he?

420
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:59,951
Sit down!

421
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:05,248
It's true.
He did give me something.

422
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,881
This.

423
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:19,887
He asked me to wear it over my heart.
He got it in the army.

424
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:24,392
Gentlemen,
it's the Good Conduct Medal.

425
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,144
Oh, well!

426
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,354
Would you care to look?

427
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,065
Yes, indeed.

428
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,903
Most inspiring.
May I?

429
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:38,823
Oh, sure.

430
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:45,413
Takes me back a few years

431
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,583
to my own army days.

432
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,084
(CLEARS THROAT)

433
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,716
Magnificent!

434
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:02,638
Miss Templeton, would you...
Would you move on, please?

435
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:07,268
Gentlemen, if we're through admiring Mr.
Webster's trophies,

436
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:09,937
I'd like to ask
Miss Davis to tell us

437
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,982
about that wild party
he threw last night.

438
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:16,152
You mean the revival meeting?

439
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,156
Mr. Webster held a revival?

440
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,993
Revival is right! Everyone
there had to be revived.

441
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,245
You're making some
very serious charges

442
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,956
against a man who is not here
to defend himself.

443
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:33,086
And that's a very interesting point.
Why isn't he here?

444
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,255
Miss Davis, do you know
where Mr. Webster is?

445
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,300
Oh, yes. He's at the Red
Cross, donating his blood.

446
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:43,596
Oh, well, that does it. They wouldn't
take his blood. It's 86 proof!

447
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,599
And why would he be there
at this particular moment?

448
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:50,061
That's where he's meeting
with his Boy Scout troop.

449
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,313
He's a Scout leader?

450
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:56,401
He's taking them on a hike
to Inspiration Point.

451
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:59,320
The top of
the Chrysler Building.

452
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:04,367
The top of the Chrysler Building
is not Inspiration Point.

453
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:07,995
Why, it is to Mr. Webster.

454
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:12,458
It looks down on Madison Avenue.

455
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:21,467
Miss Templeton, have you
anything further to say?

456
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,010
Yes.

457
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:27,682
I'd like my body
sent back to the agency.

458
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:39,569
That was quite a performance
you gave in there, Miss Davis.

459
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:42,905
You ain't mad at me?
Oh, no!

460
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,117
You should be an actress.

461
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:52,165
I am. I'm going to Hollywood, just as
soon as I'm famous as the VIP girl.

462
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,544
The VIP girl? What's VIP?

463
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:01,382
It's a brand-new product. Mr.
Webster's trying to get the account.

464
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:04,552
Oh?

465
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,763
This is gonna be my big chance.

466
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,268
And mine!

467
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,273
Millie,
drop whatever you're doing.

468
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,150
We're going
after the VIP account.

469
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,320
The what account?
VIP. V-I-P.

470
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:25,323
Never heard of it.
Well, then find out about it.

471
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,117
All I know is Jerry Webster's
trying to land it,

472
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:30,369
but we're gonna beat him to it.

473
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:33,956
Are you sure you wanna tangle
with him again? He fights rough.

474
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:38,169
Then we'll fight rough!
This is war, Millie!

475
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,547
That means liquor, wild parties,
getting the sponsor girls, right?

476
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:42,715
Right.
Good.

477
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,426
I'd like to volunteer
for frontline duty.

478
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:49,764
Well, my boy, we did it.

479
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:52,225
We have been completely
absolved by the Ad Council.

480
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:53,518
Yes.

481
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,522
We really put that Templeton
woman in her place, too.

482
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:58,898
Yes, we did.

483
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:03,027
And we deserve a reward.
A vacation.

484
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:06,864
We're going up to Dad's old hunting lodge
in Canada and do nothing but relax.

485
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:08,991
No radio, no television,
no telephones.

486
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:11,285
A thousand miles
from the nearest sponsor.

487
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,745
That sounds great.

488
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,874
Is it all right for you
to be away from Dr. Melnick?

489
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:21,754
Must be. He's the one
who suggested it.

490
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,550
Well, what do you say
you go upstairs and pack?

491
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:27,885
No, I'm going down to the office first.
Gotta check on things.

492
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,388
You go pack. I'll handle
things at the office.

493
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:31,472
You?

494
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,891
Melnick says I've gotta
start making decisions.

495
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:35,851
Well, good, grand.

496
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,522
That man has worked
miracles with me. Miracles!

497
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,732
You know, everyone should
go through analysis.

498
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,651
Not everyone can afford it.

499
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:47,530
That's the tragedy of it.
Look at these poor people.

500
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,409
They go through life,
contented, happy, laughing,

501
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:53,828
never knowing how sick they are.

502
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,457
You're sick! Sick!

503
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:04,672
Just a minute. You can't come in here.
Who are you?

504
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,049
I'm Peter Ramsey.

505
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,969
Oh, Mr. Ramsey.

506
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,971
Who are you?

507
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,848
I'm your secretary.

508
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,309
You're not Elsie.

509
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:17,727
No, sir. I'm Deborah.

510
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:21,188
Elsie got married
five weeks ago. Jerry...

511
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,941
Mr. Webster hired me.

512
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:25,067
Uh-huh.

513
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:30,448
Well, if there are any
calls today, I'm not in.

514
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:31,532
Yes, sir.

515
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,879
(HUMMING)

516
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:56,432
MAN: Yeah?

517
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,811
Well, how are we down there
in the copy department?

518
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:03,356
Are we on the ball?
Got the big picture in mind?

519
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,274
Come on, nutsy, who is this?

520
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:06,567
This is the boss.

521
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,487
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize
your voice, Mr. Webster.

522
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,697
This is Peter Ramsey.
Who is this?

523
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,115
(PHONE DISCONNECTS)

524
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,618
Hello? Hello?

525
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,297
Memo. To all departments.

526
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:31,258
Subject: Insubordination.

527
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:34,679
It has come to my attention that
certain department heads...

528
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,055
(BUZZING)

529
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,973
Yes, Hadley, come in, come in.

530
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:42,853
Oh, Mr. Ramsey, I'm sorry.
I was looking for Mr. Webster.

531
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,647
Anything I can handle?

532
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:48,818
No, sir.
I need a decision.

533
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:52,321
Now, look here, Hadley. I happen
to be president of this company.

534
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:54,865
If there are any decisions
to be made, I'll make them.

535
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,827
Well, it really isn't important.

536
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:02,206
I'll decide what's important around
here, Hadley. Now, what is it?

537
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,166
Well...

538
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,837
Comco Film Studios are calling,
and they wanna know what to do

539
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:12,883
with the VIP commercials
that Mr. Webster made.

540
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,009
Yes.

541
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:16,262
Well.

542
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:23,519
What do we usually do with commercials?
We show them.

543
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:27,857
Mr. Webster didn't brief me
on the VIP account.

544
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,236
Well, it's a lucky thing I'm here to
backstop this operation, isn't it?

545
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,989
You're familiar
with the VIP account?

546
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,450
Who do you think
put the deal together?

547
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:41,912
Oh. Well,
congratulations, sir.

548
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,915
Well, with a new product,

549
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,546
Mr. Webster usually starts off with a
saturation campaign on television,

550
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,882
you know,
to get the ball rolling.

551
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,595
Let's forget about Mr. Webster, shall we?
I'm rolling this ball.

552
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,180
Yes, sir.

553
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:03,350
We'll start off with a saturation
campaign on television.

554
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:08,564
Yes, sir. Right away.

555
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,375
Hello, Dr. Melnick?

556
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,253
Peter Ramsey.
I've done it, Doc.

557
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:34,340
I made a decision. Yeah.

558
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:36,300
And it was a beauty!

559
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:41,096
$425 for a private detective?
Why?

560
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,892
To find Jerry Webster and
track down the VIP account.

561
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,393
Did you find him?

562
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:51,148
No. Did you find
out who makes VIP?

563
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:53,567
Well, no...

564
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:56,195
Did you find out what VIP is?

565
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:58,697
No. But...

566
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:02,076
Well, as long as
it's money well spent.

567
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,579
I want you to forget the VIP account.
Webster's got it.

568
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,458
But I don't believe it.

569
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:12,336
Rebel Davis,
the VIP girl herself,

570
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,880
told me he did not
have the account locked up.

571
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:19,260
And that same day, he disappeared.
Now, something is wrong.

572
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:24,014
Well, what about all those commercials
that have been on television all week?

573
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,226
I still say something's wrong.

574
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:32,648
Mr. Brackett, please give me just a little
more time and I'll prove it to you.

575
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,403
Okay.

576
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:44,326
But if this detective doesn't
find what you're looking for,

577
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,746
there's something else
he might try finding for you.

578
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,415
A new job?

579
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:50,749
Exactly.

580
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,294
I already told him.

581
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:07,308
This is the forest primeval,

582
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:10,644
just as it was
at the dawn of civilization.

583
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:14,356
And this is how
the first man explored it,

584
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,483
in a birch-bark canoe,

585
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:21,238
pitting his skill and strength
against the raw forces of nature.

586
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:25,034
Survival of the fittest,
that's the law here.

587
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:34,168
(HONKING)

588
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,424
I think Harrison
has run out of road.

589
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,677
Good, he might
scare away the game.

590
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,266
What is that?

591
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:51,518
The mating call of the moose.

592
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:57,775
This call is
absolutely irresistible.

593
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:00,110
Your bull moose
will run for 20 miles,

594
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:03,948
he will crash through any barrier,
to get to the source of this call.

595
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:10,120
And what happens
if he gets there?

596
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,789
I take his picture.

597
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,501
Pete, he's not running
20 miles to get photographed.

598
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,128
Now, I suggest you
stop blowing that horn.

599
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,339
You just leave
the decisions to me.

600
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,257
The same wise leadership

601
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:26,553
that saved us from a costly blunder back
in New York will see us through here.

602
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,514
What costly blunder?

603
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:30,015
(LAUGHS)

604
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,642
You've been so relaxed
and happy this trip,

605
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,060
I haven't wanted to tell you.

606
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,144
You goofed.

607
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:37,940
If it weren't for me, those VIP commercials
wouldn't be on the air right now.

608
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,818
The VIP commercials are on?

609
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,153
A saturation campaign, my boy.

610
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:50,661
Now, Pete, don't panic.
Just turn around!

611
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,371
What's wrong?
Turn around!

612
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,665
What's wrong? Start paddling!
We've got to get back.

613
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,126
What's wrong? Tell me. Save
your breath and start paddling.

614
00:38:57,252 --> 00:39:00,754
I have a right to know. There's
no such product as VIP.

615
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:02,047
But...

616
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,717
But you made films!

617
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:07,803
I know I did. They were phonies
to keep Rebel in line.

618
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,597
You and your women. I told you
sex would get you into trouble!

619
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,933
Never mind me. Convince that
fella coming towards us.

620
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,356
Here she is!

621
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,035
(PETER EXCLAIMING)

622
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,330
Look at these letters,
telegrams.

623
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,875
Drugstores, markets,
wholesalers calling up.

624
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,044
All these people want VIP.

625
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:42,212
We have sold a product
that doesn't exist.

626
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,715
We have ruined the great
agency of Ramsey and Son.

627
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,050
Relax, Pete.

628
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,676
Dad will kill me!

629
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:49,428
Pete, your dad's dead and gone!

630
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,263
No, he isn't.
He's around someplace.

631
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:54,391
He wouldn't go away and leave this
business with someone like me.

632
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:57,686
Don't just sit there.
Let's do something!

633
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,147
Send Hadley in.

634
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,317
That's it. Hadley.
We'll pin the rap on him.

635
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:07,821
Sure! It's our word against his. Two
against one. Let them break Hadley.

636
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,991
He's not a senior executive.
He's expendable.

637
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,827
That's the way
Dad would've done it.

638
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,374
Hadley.
Come in, come in, Hadley.

639
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:23,629
Hadley, Webster here has
something he wants to tell you.

640
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:24,755
Telephone Comco Films.

641
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,257
Tell them we wanna make more
VIP commercials right away.

642
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,592
More VIP commercials?

643
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,010
On the double, Hadley.

644
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:31,595
Right.

645
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,140
Are you out of your mind?
There's no such product as VIP.

646
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:36,391
There will be.

647
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,644
All of these people are ready
to spend money on VIP.

648
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,104
It's only fair that
we give it to them.

649
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,064
Where do we get it?

650
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,440
We invent it.

651
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:44,691
Oh.

652
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,568
Well, can we do that?

653
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:47,736
Why not?

654
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,365
That's not the way it's done.

655
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:57,204
You're supposed to have the product first.
Then you go out and sell it.

656
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,958
Pete, you are
pioneering a method

657
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,210
that'll make you a legend
on Madison Avenue.

658
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,294
It will?

659
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:08,632
The most convincing demonstration of the
power of advertising ever conceived.

660
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:12,177
You have sold a product
that doesn't exist.

661
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,430
Yes! By thunder!

662
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,933
Even Dad didn't do that.
Right.

663
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,936
I don't think I better either.
You have no choice.

664
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,730
Either we come up with VIP
or you're ruined.

665
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:28,068
Kelly, tell accounting
I want five $1,000 bills.

666
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:30,696
Also get me the address
of Dr. Linus Tyler.

667
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,156
Linus Tyler?

668
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,080
He's the only chemist
who can come up with VIP.

669
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:36,618
No, no. He's a troublemaker.
He's dangerous non-conformist.

670
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,495
He's been fired by three companies.
Why pick him?

671
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,497
Because he's brilliant, available
and he probably needs money.

672
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:43,542
No. Money can't buy him.
He's incorruptible.

673
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:47,337
And as Dad always said, a man who
can't be bribed can't be trusted.

674
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:51,258
Isn't it comforting to know
that you can trust me?

675
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:55,721
Boss. Boss, your private eye just called.
Webster's back in town

676
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:59,224
Boss. Boss, your private eye just called.
Webster's back in town

677
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:01,685
and he followed him to this
address in Greenwich Village.

678
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,520
Dr. Linus Tyler.
Who's he?

679
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:06,064
Well, he won the Nobel Prize
in chemistry.

680
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:09,151
He's the one who did that testimonial
for Mother Murphy's Home-Made Soup.

681
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,777
Remember?
No.

682
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,280
Well, they asked him
to analyze the soup,

683
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:17,075
go on TV and tell the people what
Mother Murphy was putting in it.

684
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:21,538
He did. Broke the company
and jailed Mother Murphy.

685
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:28,253
Millie, why would Jerry Webster be
interested in a brilliant chemist?

686
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,297
VIP?

687
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:32,007
VIP.

688
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:35,594
I'll bet you
Tyler's the inventor!

689
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:49,942
You're wasting your time,
Mr. Webster.

690
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:52,277
Nothing could induce me
to again associate myself

691
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:56,573
with that dull, insipid little
group called the human race.

692
00:42:56,699 --> 00:43:00,702
Well, that's a very wise decision, Doctor.
You've quit the world!

693
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:03,247
They didn't appreciate me
when they had me, the fools.

694
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,873
Now let them suffer.

695
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:08,752
They want to be misled.

696
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:13,090
I once invented a hair tonic superior
to anything else on the market.

697
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,883
Would the public buy it?

698
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:20,806
Not until they were told it contained
a secret ingredient, TR2748.

699
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:24,893
Do you know what TR2748 was?

700
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:27,145
My phone number.

701
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:31,483
And now with VIP, the idiots
have reached the millennium.

702
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:35,153
They've bought nothing!

703
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:37,072
That's right.

704
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:41,118
Unless you
come up with something.

705
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:42,536
Never!

706
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:46,331
Here, in the comfort and
security of my laboratory,

707
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:48,583
I'm serenely happy and content.

708
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:52,796
And I have the companionship of the
one person worthy of my company.

709
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,214
Myself.

710
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,301
I want for nothing.

711
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:01,388
You're the one man
who can do it.

712
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,725
I will never again
prostitute my genius.

713
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,855
Not for all the gold
on Madison Avenue.

714
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,653
How soon do you need it?

715
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:20,365
Welcome back to the world,
Doctor.

716
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:35,130
We're completely versatile.
VIP can be anything.

717
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:39,593
Soft drink, skin lotion, soap,
cigarettes, toothpaste, anything.

718
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:42,054
The important thing, Doctor,
is speed.

719
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:44,556
Now, if I can help you
in any way...

720
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,850
Oh, well, it's very
kind of you to offer.

721
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:50,228
If you'll carry on here, I'll get
some supplies from the store room.

722
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:51,313
Fine.

723
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:03,700
Dr. Tyler?
Oh, I...

724
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:05,243
I'm Carol Templeton.

725
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:07,662
Carol Templeton.

726
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:14,002
Doctor, I would like to
talk with you about VIP.

727
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,546
It is your product, isn't it?

728
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:19,341
Yes, I invented it.
Good.

729
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:24,638
Doctor, have you signed
with Jerry Webster?

730
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,431
Why?
Well,

731
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:28,683
I'm with another agency.

732
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:32,604
And I have some marvelous
ideas for advertising VIP.

733
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:33,855
Really?
Yes.

734
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,733
And if you don't like
what I've got, I'll get more.

735
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:37,984
Fair enough.

736
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,487
I'll be at your disposal
day and night.

737
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,324
I see.

738
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:48,954
Doctor, there's nothing I
won't do to get this account.

739
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,959
No, I haven't signed
with Webster.

740
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:58,463
Oh, Dr. Tyler, I'm so happy.

741
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,466
I know this is going to work out.
Yes.

742
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:04,845
I think it has possibilities.

743
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,764
Shall we sit down,
and I'll tell you my ideas?

744
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:10,642
No. Not here.

745
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:14,354
It's too dangerous.
All these experiments...

746
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:17,023
You mean
there could be an explosion?

747
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:18,358
Exactly.

748
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:22,154
If I'm not careful, this
whole thing can blow up.

749
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,948
"V Day is coming."

750
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:28,910
I like it.
I like it very much.

751
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:32,456
Thank you, Doctor.
Got any more ideas?

752
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:35,834
Well, not yet. But I could put
the whole office to work on it.

753
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,669
Good! Good.

754
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,046
As soon as you tell me
what VIP is.

755
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:42,841
Well, that's a problem.

756
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:44,885
Problem?
Mmm-hmm.

757
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:49,556
You see, Mr. Webster's
whole strategy is secrecy.

758
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,727
To get people talking about
VIP and wondering what it is.

759
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,062
And I promised him I wouldn't
reveal it to anyone.

760
00:46:56,147 --> 00:47:01,276
So, until I decide whether to
sign with him or someone else,

761
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:04,571
I feel I must
respect my promise.

762
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,739
Naturally.

763
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,700
And I admire your integrity.

764
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:12,913
Well, Miss Templeton, I have
a code by which I live,

765
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,998
and I told this to Webster, too.

766
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:18,001
Veritas et robitas super omnia.

767
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,838
So that's where he stole it!

768
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:24,007
I beg your pardon?

769
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:28,720
Doctor, I wonder if you know the
kind of man you're dealing with.

770
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,514
Webster?
Yes.

771
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:33,558
No. I guess I don't.

772
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,561
I've only seen him
a dozen or so times.

773
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:38,605
Well, what's your opinion?

774
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,276
Oh, I prefer to reserve
judgment till I see him sober.

775
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:44,528
Oh.

776
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:47,113
Doesn't that tell you
what he is?

777
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:52,619
Miss Templeton, as my uncle,
the missionary, used to say,

778
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:56,957
"If thou canst not speak well
of a man, speak not at all."

779
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,880
You make me feel
ashamed of myself.

780
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:06,299
Oh, no. Please, I...

781
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:10,554
It's just that I cannot presume
to judge my fellow man.

782
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,806
I am but a humble chemist.

783
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:18,478
Oh, no, you're a genius
and a great humanitarian.

784
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:21,106
And I want to know you better.

785
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:27,112
Doctor, there's so much
I can learn from you.

786
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:32,951
As my father, the philosopher,
used to say,

787
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:37,664
"Knock at my door
and I shall take you in."

788
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:43,545
Dr. Tyler, I'm knocking.

789
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,839
Miss Templeton,

790
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:48,842
I'm taking you in.

791
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:54,723
And it was there, in the seclusion
of my little basement laboratory,

792
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:58,643
that the idea came to me for
this wonderful new product.

793
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,479
For a while, I was determined
not to share it with the world

794
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:04,691
that had so cruelly
disillusioned me.

795
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:08,695
But then, one night, I remembered
the words of my grandfather,

796
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,697
the philanthropist.

797
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:15,744
"The joy of living
is the joy of giving."

798
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:21,416
Oh, my!
What a magnificent family!

799
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,794
Missionary, philanthropist...
Yes.

800
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:27,589
...philosopher, doctor.

801
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:28,757
Doctor?

802
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:30,550
You!

803
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:34,179
Oh, yes. Me.

804
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,056
When you said doctor,

805
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,975
I could only think of my
brother, the jungle surgeon.

806
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,603
He was the real doctor.

807
00:49:42,355 --> 00:49:43,355
Was?

808
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:48,610
Yes. He went into the interior to
treat this tribe of sick natives,

809
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:52,238
got them back on their feet,
restored their health and appetites,

810
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,908
discovered too late
they were cannibals.

811
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:57,994
Oh, how awful!

812
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,287
Yes.

813
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,499
His last words were,

814
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:05,710
"Better me than Schweitzer."

815
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:10,423
You mean they have
advertising in Nebraska?

816
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:11,758
Oh, yes.

817
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:15,845
Of course, it was a small
advertising agency, in Omaha.

818
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,849
But somehow one of my ads came to
the attention of Mr. Brackett,

819
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,018
and he offered me a job
here in New York.

820
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:23,895
And how do you like
Madison Avenue?

821
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,689
Oh, I love it.

822
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:28,608
I love the creative challenge
of advertising.

823
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:33,738
It's the social challenge that
presents a bit of a problem.

824
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:37,659
Yes, you see, Doctor,
in my business,

825
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:41,371
I'm called upon to do a certain
amount of entertaining.

826
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:45,083
And that usually involves
a certain amount of drinking.

827
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,292
And that's a problem?

828
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:47,627
Yes.

829
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:49,587
You see, I don't drink.

830
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:51,297
Neither do I.

831
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:56,761
It's not that I object to it. It's
just that I cannot tolerate alcohol.

832
00:50:56,846 --> 00:51:00,557
Even one little glass of champagne and
I become completely irresponsible.

833
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:02,684
I might do anything.
Is that a fact?

834
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:03,768
Yes.

835
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:07,647
As a chemist, you
probably understand. Yes.

836
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:11,067
I might even be able
to do something about it.

837
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:12,736
Would you try?

838
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,738
You may depend on it.

839
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,409
Say, I'd better be getting back.

840
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,911
Mr. Webster said something
about dinner tonight.

841
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:24,748
Oh, don't have dinner with him.
What?

842
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:26,666
Let me take you to dinner.

843
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,377
Doctor, there's so much
I want to talk to you about.

844
00:51:29,462 --> 00:51:31,838
And I'll have
more ideas for VIP.

845
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,381
Well, I...
Please!

846
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:36,718
All right.
Good.

847
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:39,053
I'll pick you up at
7:00 at your lab. Fine.

848
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:42,432
Oh, no. Not there.
I'm moving.

849
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,601
Mr. Webster thinks I should
live in better surroundings,

850
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:47,103
and so he's getting me
a hotel suite.

851
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:49,105
Oh, don't let him do that!

852
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:51,232
I mean,
I'll get you a hotel suite.

853
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:53,151
Oh, Miss Templeton,
I couldn't accept...

854
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:57,155
But my agency
will pay for it. Please!

855
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,534
But you don't even know
I'll give you the VIP account.

856
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:05,538
I know that you'll make
a fair and wise decision.

857
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:10,460
A woman instinctively senses
when a man can be trusted.

858
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:14,214
And you, Doctor, can be trusted.

859
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:20,845
(CLEARS THROAT)

860
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:22,305
Excuse me.

861
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:38,446
Believe me, Rockefeller couldn't
buy a better suit than this.

862
00:52:38,531 --> 00:52:42,158
$24.95 and I throw in
a pair of knickers.

863
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:43,493
Nope.

864
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,914
Haven't you got the kind of suit that
was in style five or six years ago?

865
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,375
Have we got one.

866
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:55,755
Esther! Bring down the suit we
made for Prince Rainier's wedding.

867
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:59,425
Prince or no prince, he didn't
pick it up, he loses it.

868
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:04,639
One, two, three, together.

869
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:09,310
One, two, three, together.

870
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:10,520
Doctor.
One...

871
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,355
I think that I should
have explained.

872
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:16,401
You see, on "together" you bring
your feet together, not us.

873
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:18,611
Oh, I'm sorry.

874
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:21,614
Oh, that's all right.
You're doing very well.

875
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:26,578
One, two, three, together.

876
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:30,331
You see, actually, we should be
together all the time, like so.

877
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:33,710
And this way I can sense
what your next move will be.

878
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:36,212
How about that?

879
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:39,674
It's awfully nice of you
to teach me.

880
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,342
It's my pleasure.

881
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:44,053
I taught a Nobel Prize winner.

882
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:45,597
Oh, really? Who?

883
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:52,312
Oh, Dr. Tyler.
You're very modest.

884
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:55,398
Oh, well...

885
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:59,444
I never think of myself
as a Nobel Prize winner.

886
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:02,363
It's my cousin Maurice
who should have it.

887
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:04,866
And he will,
if he ever gets back.

888
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,285
Gets back?
Yes.

889
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:12,415
Will you swear never to repeat
what I'm about to tell you?

890
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,000
I swear.

891
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:20,131
Central intelligence refers to my
cousin as the "human satellite."

892
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:22,592
You mean...
Yes.

893
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:26,429
He was launched from Cape
Canaveral four days ago.

894
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:31,184
Every 97 minutes, Maurice
passes over this Supper Club.

895
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:37,482
Now you can understand why I
don't like to talk about myself.

896
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:49,953
I'm having such a wonderful time.
Good.

897
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,538
I really hate to leave.

898
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,582
Where are you going?

899
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,669
I have a meeting
with Mr. Webster.

900
00:54:57,753 --> 00:54:59,587
Oh, Doctor, why?

901
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:02,882
Well, I... Please, sit down.
Sit down.

902
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:06,302
Now, I'm not even
thinking about business,

903
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:10,056
but I just hate to see you associate
with someone like Webster.

904
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:15,478
You're so cultured,
so refined, so...

905
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:19,941
You're so nice.
No.

906
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:22,819
Go ahead.
Say it. "Innocent."

907
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:24,612
That's what I am.

908
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:27,865
You're a gentleman.
I'm dull.

909
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:32,370
There's one phase of my education
that's completely lacking.

910
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:35,174
But Mr. Webster is the kind of man
who can teach me what I've missed.

911
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:38,626
Oh, Doctor.
You've missed nothing.

912
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:42,588
He had a long talk with me.
I've missed it.

913
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:48,720
Believe me, there's nothing worthwhile
you can learn from Webster.

914
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:53,683
No, I find him very intriguing,
in a man-to-man sort of way.

915
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:59,731
Anyway, I've never even seen the
kind of places he wants to show me.

916
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,191
What places?

917
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:06,112
Well, I'm kind of embarrassed...

918
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:10,867
Doctor, you know you can talk to me.
Where's he taking you?

919
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:15,788
Well, it's kind of
a nightclub...

920
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:18,624
They have these girls...

921
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:22,045
They remove their...

922
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,590
They strip!

923
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:29,761
Say, I think
that's the word he used!

924
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:32,430
Anyway, he said I'd enjoy it.

925
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:37,727
Do you think you'd enjoy
watching a girl undress?

926
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,312
I don't know.

927
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,482
But I'm willing
to give it a try.

928
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:49,655
All right.

929
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:54,368
If you want to see a burlesque
show, you don't need Mr. Webster.

930
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:55,912
I'll take you.

931
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:58,122
You?
Me.

932
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:01,125
Oh, waiter.
Check, please.

933
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:05,588
Hey, Charlie, isn't that him?

934
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,009
I think it is.

935
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:13,054
Keep the change, please.
Thank you.

936
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:18,768
Oh, I almost forgot. I got you a
suite at the Royal Plaza Hotel.

937
00:57:20,229 --> 00:57:25,316
You know, it just doesn't seem right, a
man letting a woman pay for everything.

938
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:28,986
Well, you're not exactly
an ordinary man.

939
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,492
It's him.

940
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:37,787
I wonder why he grew the beard.

941
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,706
When has he got time to shave?

she was able to...

949
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:23,416
I really wouldn't know.

950
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:29,589
Doctor, would you please stop...

951
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,340
I'm sorry.

952
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:36,095
And I'm sorry
we went to that place.

953
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,847
Are you?
Yes.

954
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:41,517
From now on, I'll leave that phase
of my education to Mr. Webster.

955
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:46,022
You mean, you found watching
that girl educational?

956
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:48,983
We never studied anything
like that at MIT.

957
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:51,819
The only girls I saw
were in the chemistry lab,

958
00:58:51,904 --> 00:58:55,281
and they had on those long,
white coats.

959
00:58:57,326 --> 00:59:01,495
I had no idea what was
going on under those coats!

960
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:05,208
Doctor, do you mind
if we change the subject?

961
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,210
No.

to talk about?

964
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:16,844
Fine.

965
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:24,518
You hate this suit, don't you?

966
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:26,938
Oh, no, no.
Of course not.

967
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:29,774
It's very colorful.

968
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:33,986
I'm afraid it's the only
new suit I have.

969
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:38,658
But tomorrow I'm getting
a whole new wardrobe from...

970
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:42,703
Oh, I forgot. You don't
wanna talk about him.

971
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:44,872
Webster's buying you
a new wardrobe?

972
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:46,499
He insisted.

973
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,167
Oh, Doctor, let me buy it.

974
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:49,543
Oh, I couldn't.

975
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:52,755
But I've told you that
my agency is paying for it.

They've given me a carte Blanche
expense account just for you.

in the morning.

Yes?

980
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:08,980
How long have you
had that beard?

981
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:10,439
Don't you like it?

982
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:12,608
Yes, I do.

983
01:00:12,693 --> 01:00:14,527
It's very impressive.

984
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:19,282
Makes you look so
distinguished, so intellectual.

985

So handsome.

It's magnificent. You'd
like me to get rid of it.

I don't like it.
It's too dangerous.

994
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:56,319
Maybe she'll go back to the lab.

995
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:58,404
Maybe she'll find out
you're not Tyler.

996
01:00:58,488 --> 01:00:59,572
Maybe she'll find out
there's no VIP.

997
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:02,283
Maybe Tyler won't come up with VIP.
Maybe the world will end.

998
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,285
Do you think there's a chance?

999
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:08,998
Relax, Pete. I'm gonna keep Miss
Templeton busy day and night.

1000
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,624
What about all these orders?
People want VIP.

1001
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:14,628
They demand it now. We haven't got it.
We'll get it.

1002
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:24,055
Down in that lab, one of the most brilliant
chemists in the world is working on it.

1003
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:26,474
He may even have it, right now.

Over here, my boy.

1005
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:39,362

01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:41,072
VIP!

1007
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:44,533
Now, look, Doc. I know I
said it could be toothpaste,

1008
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:47,370
but isn't this cleaning teeth
the hard way?

1009
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:50,414
It's nothing as mundane
as toothpaste.

1010
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:55,586
Now, somewhere I made a slight mistake.
It all looked so simple.

1011

Do you know yet what VIP
is gonna be?

1012
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:01,717
Of course, my boy. VIP will
be the miracle product.

1013
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:04,804
It'll bring relief to the
suffering, joy to the depressed,

1014
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:07,264
inspiration to the artistic
and peace to the world,

1015
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:10,059
and it will sell
for only ten cents.

1016
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:13,354
Doc, that's fabulous.
It is a miracle product.

1017

How soon will you have it?

1018
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:18,859
The product I have, there are
still a few bugs in the miracle.

VIP will make you immortal.

Well, if he doesn't, he's been
taking the wrong kind of chemicals.

1030
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:23,048
(SCREAMING)

1031
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,355
That was fun!

1032
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,403
You know, you did amazingly
well for only one lesson.

1033
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:27,947
Thank you.

1034
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:32,535
I'm sorry I made you
drive so far out.

1035
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:34,662
Such a lonely stretch of beach.

1036
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:36,372
That's all right.

1037
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:39,708
Really, Linus, you shouldn't be embarrassed
to have people see you like that.

1038
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:40,793
Well, I...

1039
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,711
No, you look wonderful
without your clothes.

1040
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:44,004
So do you.

1041
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:48,884
I meant...
So did I.

1042
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:53,681
Carol, I...
Yes?

1043
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:57,476
There's something
I'd like to ask you.

1044
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,645
Go ahead.

1045
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:03,524
I'm afraid
you might misunderstand.

1046
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:06,527
No. Ask it.

1047
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:09,238
Well, I...

1048
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,284
Do you have
any more ideas for VIP?

1049
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,120
What?

1050
01:05:16,705 --> 01:05:18,872
Well, I hate to ask it,

1051
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,167
but after what
Mr. Webster said...

1052
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,296
What did he say?

1053
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:27,923
When I mentioned your idea
about "V Day is coming,"

1054
01:05:28,008 --> 01:05:30,759
he said it was all right but probably
the last one you'd ever have.

1055
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:34,013
What? He said you were
strictly a one-idea person.

1056
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:39,435
If anybody on Madison Avenue was
a one-idea person, it's him.

1057
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:42,771
His whole career's been
built on one idea. Sex.

1058
01:05:45,734 --> 01:05:47,943
You know, it's a funny
thing about you two.

1059
01:05:48,028 --> 01:05:51,030
You claim he's oversexed
and he claims you're...

1060
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:54,033
I'm what?

1061
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:56,952
I'd rather not tell you.

1062
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,288
Well, I'm not undersexed!

1063
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:01,707
I'm sure you're not.

1064
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:10,215
It's true, I haven't come up
with any new thoughts.

1065
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:15,429
But we've been having so much
fun the last few days and...

1066
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,976
I promise, tomorrow morning,

1067
01:06:21,061 --> 01:06:24,313
I'm gonna bring you a
half-a-dozen great ideas for VIP.

1068
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:27,316
Good! That'll teach Webster.

1069
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:34,740
Now, let's talk about
something more inspiring.

1070
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,367
(SIGHS)

1071
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:41,747
I wonder where Maurice is.

1072
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:43,248
Who?

1073
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:47,419
Your cousin.
The human satellite.

1074
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:49,004
Oh, him.

1075
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:55,010
Right now, he's over Russia.

1076
01:06:56,888 --> 01:07:01,016
Oh, brave, wonderful man.
Yes.

1077
01:07:02,102 --> 01:07:05,145
I've often pondered
his last words to me.

1078
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:07,606
They were so cryptic.

1079
01:07:07,816 --> 01:07:09,191
What did he say?

1080
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:12,403
He said, "Cousin Linus,

1081
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:17,199
"life is like outer space.
Explore it today,

1082
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:21,328
"for tomorrow you may not be able
to get it off the launching pad."

1083
01:07:23,123 --> 01:07:25,374
I wonder what he meant.

1084
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:29,837
He meant, enjoy life now,
before it's too late.

1085
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:38,721
You know, there is something
I'd enjoy doing right now.

1086
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:42,182
But I don't know how.

1087
01:07:43,852 --> 01:07:45,477
Well, let's see.

1088
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:50,315
I've taught you dancing, golf,

1089
01:07:50,859 --> 01:07:52,776
how to swim...

1090
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,573
What is it you'd like to do now?

1091
01:07:57,949 --> 01:07:59,616
I'd like

1092
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:02,619
to kiss you, but I...

1093
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:08,000
That's even easier than dancing.

1094
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:36,028
I think this may be
your best subject.

1095
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:39,490
Hi, Kelly.

1096
01:08:39,783 --> 01:08:43,327
Mr. Ramsey's been trying to reach you.
Oh, thank you.

1097
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:45,370
He's at your apartment.

1098
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:49,374
My apartment?
He says it's very urgent.

1099
01:08:53,797 --> 01:08:56,673
Hello, Pete? What are you
doing at my apartment?

1100
01:08:56,758 --> 01:08:58,175
Waiting for you.

1101
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:00,135
How are things going
with Dr. Tyler?

1102
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:03,263
Oh, things are going
lousy with Dr. Tyler.

1103
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:06,308
Get over here right away. Why
don't you come to the office?

1104
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:09,478
I tried to. I've been thrown
out of the lobby, twice.

1105
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,313
I'll be right there.

1106
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,988
It's no use.
I'm marked for life.

1107
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:24,368
JERRY: Have you tried alcohol?
Yes. I had three martinis.

1108
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:27,329
I warned you
not to hire that madman!

1109
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:29,665
Here, try this kind.

1110
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:39,550
Thanks. No, no, no. Rub
it on your face. Here.

1111
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:43,303
He's not a chemist. He's a
frustrated munitions maker.

1112
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:46,765
He'll never come up with VIP.
We'll be exposed.

1113
01:09:47,267 --> 01:09:50,519
This'll be the biggest scandal
that ever hit Madison Avenue.

1114
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:53,230
The agency's through.
We're ruined.

1115
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:56,066
There's only one way out.
Suicide.

1116
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:57,526
All right, all right.

1117
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,820
It'll work. We'll get
Hadley to commit suicide.

1118
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:01,697
Then we'll pin the blame on him.

1119
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:04,324
You may have a little trouble
selling that idea to Hadley.

1120
01:10:04,409 --> 01:10:08,579
He wouldn't dare refuse.
His job depends on it.

1121
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:11,999
We'll go see Tyler first thing in the
morning. I'll meet you there at 9:00.

1122
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:14,167
No, sir, you're not getting
out of my sight again.

1123
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:16,295
We're sticking together
till we get VIP.

1124
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:18,380
Okay, you can stay here tonight.

1125
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:21,133
You can even have the bed.
I'll take the couch.

1126
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:24,344
Is the alcohol working?
Yes, it is.

1127
01:10:24,429 --> 01:10:27,222
My face isn't purple anymore?
No, it isn't.

1128
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:31,977
Thanks.

1129
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:52,164
He stole it!

Where am I?

Well, this is

Are you all right?

1139
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:50,138
Try to think.
I am.

1140
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:53,183
Was he waiting for you
at your hotel last night?

1141
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:54,434
Yes, that's it.

1142
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:58,021
But how did he get you to come here?
Well, I...

1143
01:11:58,356 --> 01:12:00,357
Let me see.

1144
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:03,485
He probably gave you
something to drink.

1145
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,654
Yes, that's how he did it.

1146
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:08,699
Well, you should have refused.
Well, I...

1147
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,534
I would have ordinarily,

1148
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:14,705
but I was so dizzy from
that cigarette he gave me.

1149
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:17,457
What kind of cigarette?

1150
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:18,750
I don't know.

Yeah. If he doesn't slow down,
he's gonna catch up with us.

would steal someone else's idea.

Well, you're so decent
and honorable yourself,

it's hard for you
to think ill of anyone.

I do trust everybody.

Thank you.

Where's your maid?
I don't have one.

Oh.

1180
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:12,989
You know, I almost hate
to go back to the hotel.

1181

Webster's bound to come over and I don't
feel like talking to him right now.

1182
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:19,788
Well, don't go back
to the hotel.

1183
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:23,834
Maybe I shouldn't. I'm kind of
disillusioned with Webster.

1184
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:26,419
Well, I should think so.

1185
01:14:26,671 --> 01:14:30,465
Maybe I shouldn't let him
handle the VIP account.

Whatever you think, Linus.

1187

It's your decision.

If only I had a quiet, secluded place
where I could think about this overnight.

couldn't find me.

would never find you.

Really? Where?

1193
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:06,459

Alone with you?

All night?

1196
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:19,431
But it's really like
a separate apartment.

and your own back entrance.

01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:24,144
Well, I don't know.

1199
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:25,812
Oh, Linus.

1200
01:15:26,731 --> 01:15:28,690
We're adults.
Yes, but...

1201
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:31,318
Now, look at it
calmly and sensibly.

1202
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:33,904
You won't be disturbed here.
Right?

1203
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:35,113
Right.

1204
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:38,200
You can concentrate
on what you want to do.

1205
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:39,659
Well, that's true.

1206
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:45,207
Well, then. For what you have in
mind, isn't this the best place?

1207
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:48,877
Yes, I guess maybe it is.

1208
01:15:56,219 --> 01:15:59,221
Doc, I don't care how you
do it, or what it is.

1209
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:01,514
We've got to have VIP tomorrow.

1210
01:16:01,599 --> 01:16:04,517
But what I'm working on
is highly volatile.

1211
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:08,480
What I'm working on
is highly volatile, too.

1212
01:16:09,482 --> 01:16:11,524
That only gives me tonight.

1213
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:14,986
Believe me, Doc,
I'm in the same boat.

1215
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:29,834
Hello? Oh, yes, Mr. Brackett.

1216
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:32,754
I'm here with Mr. Gaines.
He just got back from Florida.

1217
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:35,924
And I'm filling him in on the VIP account.
How does it look?

1218
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:37,801
(WHISPERS)
Marvelous! In fact...

1219
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:42,180
Dr. Tyler's having dinner
here at my place tonight.

1220
01:16:42,265 --> 01:16:43,431
Fine.

1221
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:46,351
We'll expect good news
in the morning. Good night.

1222
01:16:46,686 --> 01:16:50,855
Well, looks pretty good. Dr. Tyler's
having dinner at her apartment tonight.

1223
01:16:50,982 --> 01:16:54,359
Linus Tyler, in a woman's apartment?
Why not?

1224
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:56,236
Miss Templeton is
very attractive.

1225
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,364
Look, I know Tyler.
He's a confirmed woman-hater.

1226
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,324
Yeah. Maybe he used to be.

1227
01:17:01,492 --> 01:17:05,120
But Jenkins from the art department saw
them dancing together the other night.

1228
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:07,622
Linus Tyler, out dancing?

1229
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:10,625
Something's wrong, John.
Come on.

1230
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:12,002
Where are we going?

1231
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:14,379
Greenwich Village, to see Tyler.

1232
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:15,880
More coffee?

1233
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:17,507
No, thank you very much.

1234
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:21,428
You know,

1235
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:26,766
I have a small bottle of
champagne someone gave me once.

1236
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:32,230
And I debated
whether to open it tonight.

1237
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:35,900
But knowing how susceptible
we both are...

1238
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:37,819
You were absolutely right.

1239
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:42,907
And in view of the situation,

1240
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:46,619
being here alone as we are.

1241
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:51,791
I think that we should be especially...
Definitely.

1242
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:57,005
Well, I'll help you
with the dishes.

1243
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:59,924
Oh, I wouldn't think of it.

1244
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:01,760
It's a woman's job.

1245
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:03,470
Well.

1246
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:05,847
Just make yourself comfortable.

1247
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:10,560
It's 10:30.
I'd better be getting to bed.

1248
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:13,855
Oh.

1249
01:18:15,066 --> 01:18:17,442
Thank you
for a delightful evening.

1250
01:18:17,777 --> 01:18:20,987
You're a wonderful cook,
charming company,

1251
01:18:21,072 --> 01:18:24,532
and some day, you're gonna make
some man a very fine wife.

1252
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:28,203
Thank you, Linus.

1253
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:33,375
And some day, you're going to make
some lucky woman a very fine husband.

1254
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:35,126
That's kind of you.

1255
01:18:37,296 --> 01:18:40,882
I'm afraid I could never
get married. Good night.

1256
01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:44,594
Wait!

1257
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:49,140
Why can't you get married?

1258
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:53,937
It's the sort of thing a man
doesn't discuss with a nice woman.

1259
01:18:54,605 --> 01:18:56,481
Oh, Linus.

1260
01:18:57,316 --> 01:18:58,608
What is it?

1261
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:02,654
Carol, I'm going to say
something that'll shock you.

1262
01:19:03,072 --> 01:19:06,866
Do you know who I wish I were right
at this moment? Jerry Webster!

1263
01:19:06,951 --> 01:19:08,535
Oh, no!
Yes.

1264
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:11,538
Why? Because he's
everything I'm not,

1265
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:14,499
and want to be.
He's a man of the world.

1266
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:18,420
He's smooth, he's confident,
he's experienced.

1267
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:20,338
He's a real man.

1268
01:19:20,423 --> 01:19:22,215
You're the real man!
Am I?

1269
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:24,843
Yes.
Look at me.

1270
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:29,180
Here I am with a beautiful
girl alone in her apartment.

1271
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:32,600
10:30 and for me the evening is over.
I'm through.

1272
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:36,271
Oh, Linus! Do you know what
Jerry Webster would do?

1273
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:39,274
In two minutes, he'd maneuver
you into that bedroom!

1274
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,360
Oh, I'm sorry.

1275
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:47,031
I didn't know what I was saying.
I didn't mean it.

1276
01:19:47,825 --> 01:19:51,703
I know you didn't...
But I feel so insecure.

1277
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:54,456
Oh, Linus,
stop torturing yourself.

1278
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:59,335
Now you know why I'm afraid
to get married.

1279
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:01,463
I'm afraid.

1280
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:03,715
Afraid I'll be a failure.

1281
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:06,217
But you won't.

1282
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:08,052
I know.

1283
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:11,556
A woman knows these things.

1284
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:16,227
Don't lie to me, please. I'd rather
have your scorn than your pity.

1285
01:20:18,898 --> 01:20:21,524
Linus, listen to me.

1286
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:24,527
It isn't pity, and I didn't lie.

1287
01:20:24,612 --> 01:20:27,113
Yesterday at the beach you
kissed me and I was thrilled.

1288
01:20:27,198 --> 01:20:29,824
A kiss?
What does that prove?

1289
01:20:31,035 --> 01:20:33,328
It's like finding out
you can light a stove.

1290
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:34,692
It still doesn't
make you a cook.

1291
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:37,999
Linus, listen to me.
Look at me.

1292
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:40,668
I can't. I'm too ashamed.

1293
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:44,964
Forget me, Carol.
You deserve a man,

1294
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:48,092
not a mass of neurotic doubts.

1295
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:52,514
Oh, Linus,
you mustn't have these doubts.

1296
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:56,893
You're tearing yourself apart.
You're a fine man, a brilliant man.

1297
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:59,604
Sure. Brilliant chemist!

I'd trade all of my knowledge
to know one thing.

1301
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:09,113
How to make a woman love me.

1302
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:12,784
You can.
No. I can't.

1303
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:15,870
That's not true.

1304
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:19,749
You're a kind, sensitive person.

1305
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:22,794
But am I the kind of man
a woman could love?

1306
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,963
Of course you are.

1307
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:27,549
But I don't know
and it's killing me.

1308
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:30,843
Linus, don't do this
to yourself!

1309
01:21:31,512 --> 01:21:33,680
Any woman would love you.

Should I avoid his touch?

01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:24,131
After you get into the water,
I'll join you.

1371
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:25,549
Okay.

1372
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:32,056
Well, that's it.
Now it's your turn.

1373
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:33,557
Yes.

1374
01:28:34,685 --> 01:28:36,394
Now it's my turn.

1375
01:28:37,688 --> 01:28:39,814
Good night, Mr. Webster!

1376
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:44,652
Hey, wait! Hey, come back!
Come back!

1377
01:28:44,903 --> 01:28:47,780
I'm losing my confidence again!

1378
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:02,712
You know, I've picked up
some hitchhikers in my day,

1379
01:29:02,796 --> 01:29:05,256
but, man, you were a weird
sight, running along the road

1380
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:08,259
in them seaweed jockey shorts.

1381
01:29:16,768 --> 01:29:19,228
I'll have your coat
back in a minute.

1382
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:37,997
Hey, Fred.

1383
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:39,999
Look.

1384
01:29:57,350 --> 01:30:00,561
That's the last guy in the
world I would have figured.

1385
01:30:01,813 --> 01:30:04,648
There'll be no slip-up
this time, Mr. Northcross.

1386
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:07,651
You subpoena Jerry Webster
in front of the Ad Council,

1387
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:12,239
and I'll present enough evidence
to put him behind bars.

1388
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:16,410
They've been advertising a
product that doesn't even exist!

1389
01:30:16,495 --> 01:30:17,578
Yes!

1390
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:20,623
Well, I've already spoken
to the District Attorney,

1391
01:30:20,707 --> 01:30:22,500
and he wants to be there.

1392
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:27,421
No, Mr. Northcross, I'm not
trying to stall for time.

1393
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:31,967
It just happens that 11:00 is
when I go down to donate blood.

1394
01:30:32,636 --> 01:30:35,304
But they need it.
It's a very rare type.

1395
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:40,351
11:00. I'll be there.

1396
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:46,273
Did Hadley find Tyler?
Not yet.

1397
01:30:46,358 --> 01:30:49,068
That Templeton. What a
mean, vindictive woman.

1398
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:51,070
Lay off her, Kelly.

1399
01:30:51,363 --> 01:30:54,281
Congratulate me, boy.
I've saved the day!

1400
01:30:54,366 --> 01:30:56,033
I've been working with my
lawyers, and we've come up

1401
01:30:56,118 --> 01:30:58,786
with an iron-clad document that
will hold up in any court.

1402
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,621
This solves everything.
Great! What is it?

1403
01:31:00,705 --> 01:31:03,999
A full and complete
confession. Sign.

1404
01:31:04,084 --> 01:31:06,794
Are you kidding? I could
go to jail for five years.

1405
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:11,048
No, that's covered in here. We make a
deal with the judge. Two years. Sign.

1406
01:31:11,133 --> 01:31:13,509
Forget it.
Two years!

1407
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:15,928
It's like being drafted. Think of
me as your commander in chief.

1408
01:31:16,012 --> 01:31:18,222
Greetings from the president.
Sign.

1409
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:24,228
I couldn't find Dr. Tyler anywhere.
The guy has disappeared.

1410
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:25,980
That tears it.

1411
01:31:26,523 --> 01:31:27,857
Hadley.

1412
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:32,153
Step over to the window.

1413
01:31:33,155 --> 01:31:37,241
Mr. Ramsey, I told you,
I am not going to jump!

1414
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:41,662
You don't have to jump. I'll trip you, huh?
Double indemnity.

1415
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:43,414
Your wife will be loaded.
Kids will go to college.

1416
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:46,000
Right? Come on, boy, run!

1417
01:31:46,084 --> 01:31:47,835
Pete, knock it off.

1418
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:51,422
You won't sign, you won't jump.
I'm surrounded by traitors.

1419
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:53,799
Dr. Tyler's here.

1420
01:31:53,967 --> 01:31:56,302
Doctor, where've you been?

1421
01:31:56,386 --> 01:31:59,597
In the subway. They couldn't
change a $1000 bill.

1422
01:32:01,308 --> 01:32:03,601
Gentlemen, I give you VIP!

1423
01:32:04,102 --> 01:32:05,644
That is VIP?

1424
01:32:05,729 --> 01:32:07,104
They look like mints.

1425
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:08,772
Don't they though?

1426
01:32:09,024 --> 01:32:13,861
$100,000 for advertising, and what
does he give us to sell? Candy!

1427
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:15,821
I don't care if they're
colored matzoh balls.

1428
01:32:15,906 --> 01:32:18,449
At least I've got something
to show the Ad Council.

1429
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:21,869
Come on, Hadley. Let's go down to the art
department and have wrappers made up.

1430
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:24,205
Nobel Prize winner, huh?

1431
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:26,790
For this, I could have
hired Fanny Farmer.

1432
01:32:26,917 --> 01:32:29,543
Well, at ten cents a piece,
why, you'll make millions.

1433
01:32:29,628 --> 01:32:31,420
Ten cents for one of these?

1434
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:33,631
Try it.

1435
01:32:33,715 --> 01:32:35,925
I've tasted candy before.

1436
01:32:36,009 --> 01:32:38,677
Not like these. Try it.

1437
01:32:44,017 --> 01:32:45,768
Well, have the rest of it.

1438
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:56,946
I think you'd better sit down. There
should be a reaction shortly.

1439
01:32:57,864 --> 01:33:01,283
I made it very emphatic to Webster
that he be here at 11:00.

1440
01:33:01,368 --> 01:33:04,245
Hadley!
Hold that elevator!

1441
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:10,334
PETER: VIP, oh!

1442
01:33:11,002 --> 01:33:12,962
I think I'll try a red one.

1443
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:15,047
I think you've had enough.

1444
01:33:15,173 --> 01:33:18,425
Don't worry about me.
I can hold my candy.

1445
01:33:18,718 --> 01:33:22,304
You know something?
I wanna tell you,

1446
01:33:23,515 --> 01:33:25,307
you've come up with a great
little mint, here. You know that?

1447
01:33:25,392 --> 01:33:26,558
Mint?

1448
01:33:26,977 --> 01:33:28,811
Mint, you say?

1449
01:33:31,314 --> 01:33:35,693
This priceless pastille which you
so carelessly refer to as a mint

1450
01:33:35,777 --> 01:33:39,321
is in reality a triumph
of advanced biochemistry.

1451
01:33:39,406 --> 01:33:43,951
Looks like candy. Tastes like candy.
Goes down like candy.

1452
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:47,579
But it enters the bloodstream
as pure alcohol.

1453
01:33:47,664 --> 01:33:51,875
Each one of these is the
equivalent of a triple martini.

1454
01:33:53,003 --> 01:33:55,045
Here's to you, Doc.
Bottoms up!

1455
01:33:56,298 --> 01:33:59,216
I've given this country
what it has long needed.

1456
01:33:59,759 --> 01:34:02,011
A good ten-cent drunk.

1457
01:34:03,096 --> 01:34:06,432
Well, I told you
he wouldn't show up.

1458
01:34:06,891 --> 01:34:08,934
I think the District Attorney
should take over.

1459
01:34:09,019 --> 01:34:12,187
It seems in order to issue a
bench warrant for his arrest.

1460
01:34:12,272 --> 01:34:14,690
And if he resists, gun him down!

1461
01:34:14,774 --> 01:34:18,360
Good morning.
I'm sorry to be late,

1462
01:34:18,445 --> 01:34:20,571
but I stopped to pick up
a carton of VIP.

1463
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:23,782
You mean there is
such a product?

1464
01:34:23,867 --> 01:34:26,577
Would I advertise it
if there weren't?

1465
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:29,204
That would be dishonest.

1466
01:34:30,248 --> 01:34:32,666
Gentlemen, I give you VIP.

1467
01:34:32,751 --> 01:34:36,587
A pleasant confection to be
enjoyed by the entire family.

1468
01:34:41,468 --> 01:34:43,218
This is nothing but a mint!

1469
01:34:43,303 --> 01:34:46,138
Well, I never said
it was anything more.

1470
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:49,641
It's quite tasty.

1471
01:34:49,726 --> 01:34:52,269
Really? WILLIAMS: May
I have another one?

1472
01:34:52,896 --> 01:34:56,065
Sure, Mr. Williams.
Help yourself.

1473
01:35:00,153 --> 01:35:01,987
Gentlemen, help yourselves.

1474
01:35:02,072 --> 01:35:04,782
They're unusually refreshing.

1475
01:35:06,785 --> 01:35:08,994
Try a green one.
How many colors are there?

1476
01:35:09,079 --> 01:35:11,705
Six.
Let's all have one of each.

I don't know. He just
suddenly went wild.

01:35:29,057 --> 01:35:30,891
He kicked in this picture
of his father.

1482

01:39:33,843 --> 01:39:35,010
(EXCLAIMS)

1537
01:39:40,391 --> 01:39:42,726
Where can I go to get
this marriage annulled?

1538
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:46,355
Now, darling, it's only natural to
be a little frightened at first.

1539
01:39:46,439 --> 01:39:50,442
Like olives, dear, it's something
you acquire a taste for.

1540
01:39:52,403 --> 01:39:57,616
Get me New York City,
Plaza 89970. I'll hold on.

1541
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:08,085
Hello, Pete? This is Jerry.

1542
01:40:08,503 --> 01:40:11,338
I'm in Maryland, but I
don't know how I got here.

1543
01:40:11,422 --> 01:40:13,840
I'll tell you how you got there.

1544
01:40:13,966 --> 01:40:16,968
You ate some of those
poison pellets

1545
01:40:17,053 --> 01:40:20,514
your Frankenstein friend Tyler
came up with.

1546
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:25,936
Candy nothing! That stuff
turns into pure alcohol.

1547
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:29,189
Oh, that explains it.

1548
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:31,400
What about the Ad Council?

1549
01:40:31,484 --> 01:40:33,777
Well, they found Northcross

1550
01:40:34,112 --> 01:40:38,907
barricaded in the ladies' lounge
at Radio City Music Hall.

1551
01:40:39,659 --> 01:40:43,578
Williams was on stage,
dancing with the Rockettes.

1552
01:40:43,663 --> 01:40:48,250
And Magnuson just washed up
on the beach at Waikiki.

1553
01:40:48,334 --> 01:40:50,001
Yeah, he's alive.

1554
01:40:52,422 --> 01:40:54,965
Can't find
the District Attorney though.

1555
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:56,049
Oh?

1556
01:40:57,510 --> 01:41:00,345
Is he a gray-haired man
with a moustache?

1557
01:41:03,808 --> 01:41:07,811
I think he was best man
at my wedding.

1558
01:41:09,147 --> 01:41:13,316
Relax, Pete. I'm gonna
sign the confession.

1559
01:41:13,401 --> 01:41:14,568
I'm taking the rap
for everything.

1560
01:41:14,652 --> 01:41:17,946
No, you're not. I'm not letting
you take the rap alone.

1561
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:20,574
And I'll see that
Hadley signs that, too.

1562
01:41:20,658 --> 01:41:22,242
That won't be necessary.

1563
01:41:22,326 --> 01:41:23,660
Excuse me,
Mr. Ramsey.

1564
01:41:23,745 --> 01:41:26,580
There are two men here to see you.
They wanna talk to you about VIP.

1565
01:41:26,664 --> 01:41:29,541
It's the FBI!
Send them in here.

1566
01:41:30,293 --> 01:41:32,002
I don't want you to think
that I'm abandoning you.

1567
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:33,503
The same brilliant lawyers

1568
01:41:33,588 --> 01:41:37,048
who drew up this iron-clad document
will be right by your side in court,

1569
01:41:37,133 --> 01:41:38,216
trying to break it.

1570
01:41:38,301 --> 01:41:42,095
I'll get you a fair trial if I have
to buy out every person in the jury.

1571
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:43,263
Thanks.

1572
01:41:44,348 --> 01:41:45,599
Mr. Ramsey?

1573
01:41:46,017 --> 01:41:48,602
I'm Ramsey. But this is the man you want.
Jerry Webster.

1574
01:41:48,686 --> 01:41:50,103
He alone is responsible for VIP.

1575
01:41:50,188 --> 01:41:52,606
He invented it.
He dreamed it up.

1576
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:54,191
Is that true,
Mr. Webster?

1577
01:41:54,275 --> 01:41:56,151
Yes.
It's all right here.

1578
01:41:56,235 --> 01:41:59,029
Don't say another word
until I get the lawyers.

1579
01:42:00,364 --> 01:42:03,492
We don't need lawyers here,
Mr. Webster.

1580
01:42:03,576 --> 01:42:05,577
Now, what is your price?

1581
01:42:06,537 --> 01:42:09,247
Price? We represent
the liquor industry.

1582
01:42:09,499 --> 01:42:12,000
How much would it take
to burn that formula?

1583
01:42:12,794 --> 01:42:14,127
Well, I...

1584
01:42:16,005 --> 01:42:20,634
Gentlemen, you don't seem to realize
what you're asking me to do.

1585
01:42:20,718 --> 01:42:23,720
Now, look. The government
is going to stop you anyhow.

1586
01:42:23,805 --> 01:42:28,642
But every day that candy is on the market,
we lose money. Now name your price.

1587
01:42:29,519 --> 01:42:31,561
Now, let's see.

1588
01:42:31,854 --> 01:42:37,901
The liquor industry spends roughly $60
million a year in advertising. Right?

1589
01:42:37,985 --> 01:42:42,030
Right. And we're prepared to give
you 20% of our total billing.

1590
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:44,991
WALLACE: You can open your own
agency with an account like that.

1591
01:42:45,409 --> 01:42:48,370
Twenty-five percent.
Agreed.

1592
01:42:48,454 --> 01:42:51,915
And you're not to give the account to me.
You're to give it to Mrs...

1593
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:53,750
That is...

1594
01:42:54,001 --> 01:42:58,421
Miss Carol Templeton, of
Brackett, MacAlpin and Gaines.

1595
01:42:58,923 --> 01:43:01,383
If that's what you want.
It is.

1596
01:43:02,301 --> 01:43:03,760
Shall we?

1597
01:43:11,102 --> 01:43:14,521
HODGES: Our attorneys will draw up
an agreement for your signature.

1598
01:43:14,647 --> 01:43:16,648
Fine. No.

1599
01:43:18,025 --> 01:43:22,779
Send it to San Francisco. I'm
moving to our West Coast office.

1600
01:43:22,864 --> 01:43:25,615
Very well.
Thank you, Mr. Webster.

1601
01:43:25,783 --> 01:43:27,117
Thank you.

1602
01:43:31,998 --> 01:43:33,398
Are you taking
Mr. Webster with you?

1603
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:35,959
No, he's going to San Francisco.

1604
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:37,752
San Francisco?

1605
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:40,672
Alcatraz!

1606
01:43:44,218 --> 01:43:50,307
This one I didn't notice...
Yeah, take all of these.

1607
01:43:51,142 --> 01:43:53,852
Oh, Pete.
I'll be leaving tonight.

1608
01:43:56,063 --> 01:43:57,856
We'll miss you, boy.

1609
01:43:58,274 --> 01:43:59,983
I'm taking Kelly with me.

1610
01:44:02,153 --> 01:44:04,446
If anybody can do it, you can.

1611
01:44:10,995 --> 01:44:13,622
Hello. Hello, Mr. Webster.

1612
01:44:13,706 --> 01:44:17,167
This is Millie,
Miss Templeton's secretary.

1613
01:44:17,585 --> 01:44:22,213
You know that girl you married nine
months ago and she got it annulled?

1614
01:44:22,298 --> 01:44:25,884
Well, it seems that there was
something she couldn't get annulled.

1615
01:44:26,344 --> 01:44:27,761
She'd kill me if she knew
I was calling you,

1616
01:44:27,845 --> 01:44:29,262
but I think that every man
has a right to know

1617
01:44:29,347 --> 01:44:31,514
when he's about
to become a father.

1618
01:44:41,567 --> 01:44:43,360
Got the marriage license.

1619
01:44:43,527 --> 01:44:45,779
And the judge has agreed to waive
the three-day waiting period.

1620
01:44:45,863 --> 01:44:48,782
Yes, I can marry you
immediately.

1621
01:44:49,617 --> 01:44:53,411
The ring! I haven't got the ring!
Here, you can use mine.

1622
01:44:55,414 --> 01:44:56,498
Yours?

1623
01:44:56,999 --> 01:45:01,086
Well, I've been carrying it for years.
I believe in being prepared.

1624
01:45:03,255 --> 01:45:04,965
JERRY: Carol,
please, listen to me.

1625
01:45:05,049 --> 01:45:07,008
I will not marry you.

1626
01:45:07,093 --> 01:45:10,845
Now go away, I'm busy.
Darling, I love you.

1627
01:45:10,930 --> 01:45:14,683
No, you don't. You went to
California and forgot me.

1628
01:45:14,767 --> 01:45:17,185
Forgot you? I sent you
hundreds of letters.

1629
01:45:17,269 --> 01:45:19,813
I wrote one every day
for eight months.

1630
01:45:19,897 --> 01:45:23,775
And the ninth month, when I
needed you most, not a word!

1631
01:45:23,901 --> 01:45:25,485
I didn't know
what was happening.

1632
01:45:25,569 --> 01:45:28,238
You sent back every letter,
unopened.

1633
01:45:28,322 --> 01:45:30,824
If you loved me,
you'd have kept on writing.

1634
01:45:30,908 --> 01:45:32,575
Darling, I do love you.

1635
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:34,577
Please marry me!

1636
01:45:35,705 --> 01:45:38,957
Well, I'll have to
think about it.

1637
01:45:39,125 --> 01:45:40,917
I don't want to rush
into anything.

1638
01:45:41,002 --> 01:45:42,252
Now you listen to me.

1639
01:45:42,336 --> 01:45:45,255
You're going up there
to have my baby, my son...

1640
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:50,593
It's my baby and I'll have what I want,
and I've decided to have a girl.

1641
01:45:50,678 --> 01:45:55,015
Have whatever makes you happy. I love
you both. Now will you marry me?

1642
01:45:57,268 --> 01:46:00,520
I always wanted
a church wedding.

1643
01:46:01,272 --> 01:46:03,690
The next baby,
we'll have a church wedding.

1644
01:46:03,774 --> 01:46:07,068
Now, please, say yes.

1645
01:46:07,695 --> 01:46:10,530
Oh, yes!

1646
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:13,116
Judge?
Join hands, please.

1647
01:46:13,784 --> 01:46:17,203
We are gathered together to unite
this man and this woman in marriage.

1648
01:46:18,122 --> 01:46:21,708
...as such, I trust it
will symbolize your union.

1649
01:46:21,792 --> 01:46:25,837
Then by the powers vested in me by
the sovereign State of New York,

1650
01:46:25,963 --> 01:46:29,466
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

1651
01:46:30,843 --> 01:46:34,763
Man! That's what I call
cutting it close!
