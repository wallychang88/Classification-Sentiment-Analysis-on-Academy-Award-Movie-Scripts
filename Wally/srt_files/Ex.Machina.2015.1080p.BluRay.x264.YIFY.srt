1
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:56,640
How long until
we get to his estate?

2
00:01:59,602 --> 00:02:02,549
We've been flying over his
estate for the past two hours.

3
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,806
You're leaving me here?

4
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:34,973
This is as close as I'm allowed
to get to the building.

5
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:36,750
What building?

6
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,780
Follow the river.

7
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:40,711
Got it.

8
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:42,882
Keep your head down and
get clear of the rotors.

9
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:44,050
Okay.

10
00:03:42,906 --> 00:03:44,305
<i>Caleb Smith.</i>

11
00:03:45,207 --> 00:03:46,209
Yes.

12
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:49,012
<i>Please approach the console
and face the screen.</i>

13
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:01,462
Oh!

14
00:04:03,058 --> 00:04:04,299
<i>Take your keycard.</i>

15
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,000
<i>You may now
enter the residence.</i>

16
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,704
Hello?

17
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,052
Hello?

18
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:50,375
Caleb Smith.

19
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:52,067
Hey.

20
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:55,172
Dude!

21
00:05:56,004 --> 00:05:58,417
I've been so looking forward
to this week with you.

22
00:05:58,574 --> 00:05:59,779
Come in. Come on in.

23
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:00,843
Thanks.

24
00:06:01,411 --> 00:06:04,584
You want something to eat or
drink after your journey?

25
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:05,990
- No. No, thanks, I'm fine.
- Sure?

26
00:06:06,048 --> 00:06:07,153
Yeah.

27
00:06:07,216 --> 00:06:09,627
To be honest,
I thought we'd have, uh,

28
00:06:09,752 --> 00:06:11,788
breakfast together,
but, um...

29
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:13,889
I can't really
eat anything.

30
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,997
- I've got the mother of all fucking hangovers.
- Oh, yeah?

31
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:18,060
Oh, my God, like you
wouldn't even believe.

32
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,867
When I have a heavy
night, I, uh...

33
00:06:19,928 --> 00:06:21,464
compensate the
next morning.

34
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:24,603
Exercise. Anti-oxidants.
You know?

35
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:26,346
Yeah, sure.

36
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,377
Was it a good party?

37
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:35,148
- Party?
- Yeah. Wasn't there a party?

38
00:06:37,512 --> 00:06:39,322
There wasn't a party.

39
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:40,382
Sorry.

40
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:43,987
Caleb, I'm just gonna throw this
out there, so it's said, okay?

41
00:06:44,052 --> 00:06:45,088
You're freaked out.

42
00:06:45,153 --> 00:06:46,928
- I am?
- Yeah. You're freaked out,

43
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:48,194
by the helicopter

44
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:49,564
and the mountains
and the house,

45
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,036
because it's all
so super-cool.

46
00:06:51,093 --> 00:06:52,834
You're freaked out by me,
to be meeting me,

47
00:06:52,894 --> 00:06:55,603
having this conversation in this
room, at this moment. Right?

48
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:59,112
And I get that. I get the
moment you're having, but...

49
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:00,976
Dude, can we just
get past that?

50
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:03,706
Can we just be two guys?
Nathan and Caleb.

51
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:06,514
Not the whole
employer-employee thing.

52
00:07:07,442 --> 00:07:08,786
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah?

53
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,050
Yes. Uh, yeah.

54
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:12,651
It's good to meet you, Nathan.

55
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:15,353
It's good to
meet you, too, Caleb.

56
00:07:17,552 --> 00:07:19,999
I guess the first thing I
should do is explain your pass.

57
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:21,557
Now, it's simple enough.

58
00:07:21,723 --> 00:07:23,795
It opens some doors
and it doesn't open others.

59
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,567
And that just makes everything
easy for you, right?

60
00:07:25,627 --> 00:07:26,663
Uh, yes.

61
00:07:26,762 --> 00:07:28,572
Yeah, 'cause you're like, "Oh,
fuck, I'm in someone else's house.

62
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,870
"Can I do this,
can I do that?"

63
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:32,002
And this card, it just
takes all that worry away.

64
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:35,310
If you try a door and it stays
shut, okay, it's off-limits.

65
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,648
You try another door and it
opens, then it's for you.

66
00:07:38,707 --> 00:07:40,449
Let's try this one.

67
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,519
I guess
it's for you, Caleb.

68
00:07:53,923 --> 00:07:55,367
- You like?
- Yeah.

69
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:56,961
It's your room.

70
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,901
You got a bed here.

71
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:01,766
A bathroom
right back here.

72
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:03,276
Little desk.

73
00:08:03,331 --> 00:08:04,675
Cupboards.

74
00:08:07,836 --> 00:08:09,372
Little fridge.

75
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:12,408
Cozy, right?

76
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:13,886
Yeah, this is great.

77
00:08:13,942 --> 00:08:15,649
- What?
- Sorry?

78
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:18,492
There's something wrong.
What's wrong?

79
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:19,720
There's nothing wrong.

80
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,394
It's the windows.

81
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,088
You're thinking
there's no windows.

82
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:27,591
It's subterranean.

83
00:08:27,656 --> 00:08:29,694
It's not cozy,
it's claustrophobic.

84
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,500
No. No way. I wasn't
thinking that.

85
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,201
I was thinking,
"This is really cool."

86
00:08:35,197 --> 00:08:38,838
Caleb, there's a reason there
are no windows in this room.

87
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:40,275
- There is?
- Uh-huh.

88
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:42,606
This building
isn't a house.

89
00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:44,673
It's a research facility.

90
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:47,783
Buried in these walls
is enough fiber optic cable

91
00:08:47,844 --> 00:08:50,187
to reach the moon
and lasso it.

92
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:53,691
And I want to talk to you
about what I'm researching,

93
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:55,227
I want to share it with you.

94
00:08:55,283 --> 00:08:59,629
In fact, I want to share it with you
so much, it's eating me up inside.

95
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:03,767
But there's something I need
you to do for me first.

96
00:09:07,996 --> 00:09:10,636
"Blue Book
non-disclosure agreement."

97
00:09:11,366 --> 00:09:12,368
Hmm.

98
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,176
Take your time.
Read it over.

99
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:19,183
"The signee agrees
to regular data audit

100
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:20,619
"with unlimited access,

101
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:22,355
"to confirm that
no disclosure

102
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:24,618
"of information
has taken place

103
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,956
"in public
or private forums,

104
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,352
"using any means
of communication,

105
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:31,192
"including but not limited

106
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:33,325
"to that which is
disclosed orally

107
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:36,625
"or in written
or electronic form."

108
00:09:39,695 --> 00:09:40,866
I think I need a lawyer.

109
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:44,001
- It's standard.
- It doesn't feel very standard.

110
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:46,008
Okay, it's not standard.

111
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:48,878
What can I tell you, Caleb?
You don't have to sign it.

112
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:50,417
You know, we can spend
the next few days

113
00:09:50,472 --> 00:09:52,611
just shooting pool,
getting drunk together.

114
00:09:52,674 --> 00:09:53,914
Bonding.

115
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:57,489
And when you discover what you've
missed out on, in about a year,

116
00:09:57,547 --> 00:10:00,755
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

117
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,491
Good call.

118
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,400
So,

119
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:21,807
do you know what
the Turing Test is?

120
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:26,578
Yeah.

121
00:10:26,808 --> 00:10:28,811
I know what
the Turing Test is.

122
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,227
It's when a human
interacts with a computer.

123
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:36,822
And if the human
doesn't know

124
00:10:36,885 --> 00:10:39,331
they're interacting
with a computer,

125
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,389
the test is passed.

126
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,169
And what does
a pass tell us?

127
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,298
That the computer has
artificial intelligence.

128
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:48,899
Are you building an AI?

129
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,042
I've already built one.

130
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,338
And over the next few days,

131
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:56,009
you're gonna be the human
component in a Turing Test.

132
00:10:56,272 --> 00:10:59,548
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, that's right, Caleb. You got it.

133
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,885
Because if that
test is passed,

134
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:05,859
you are dead center

135
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:08,691
of the greatest scientific
event in the history of man.

136
00:11:09,384 --> 00:11:11,057
If you've created
a conscious machine,

137
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,532
it's not the history of man.

138
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,195
That's the history of gods.

139
00:12:58,994 --> 00:12:59,995
Hello.

140
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:03,566
Hi.

141
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:06,576
I'm Caleb.

142
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:10,149
Hello, Caleb.

143
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:14,278
Do you have a name?

144
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,181
Yes.

145
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,549
Ava.

146
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,092
I'm pleased
to meet you, Ava.

147
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:25,024
I'm pleased
to meet you, too.

148
00:13:26,788 --> 00:13:29,201
I've never met
anyone new before.

149
00:13:29,924 --> 00:13:31,336
Only Nathan.

150
00:13:32,661 --> 00:13:35,971
Then I guess we're both
in quite a similar position.

151
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,510
Haven't you met
lots of new people before?

152
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:41,004
None like you.

153
00:13:41,202 --> 00:13:42,273
Hmm.

154
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:47,413
So we need
to break the ice.

155
00:13:48,344 --> 00:13:50,482
- Do you know what I mean by that?
- Yes.

156
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:51,820
What do I mean?

157
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,418
Overcome initial
social awkwardness.

158
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:56,461
So let's have
a conversation.

159
00:13:57,452 --> 00:13:58,591
<i>Okay.</i>

160
00:14:00,855 --> 00:14:03,062
<i>What would you like to have
a conversation about?</i>

161
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,696
Why don't we start with you telling
me something about yourself?

162
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:08,333
What would you
like to know?

163
00:14:08,563 --> 00:14:10,304
Whatever comes
into your head.

164
00:14:10,365 --> 00:14:13,643
Well, you already
know my name.

165
00:14:14,836 --> 00:14:17,147
And you can see
that I'm a machine.

166
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:19,849
- Would you like to know how old I am?
- Sure.

167
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,210
I'm one.

168
00:14:21,543 --> 00:14:22,817
One what?

169
00:14:23,678 --> 00:14:25,716
- One year or one day?
- One.

170
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:31,827
When did you learn
how to speak, Ava?

171
00:14:33,087 --> 00:14:35,192
<i>I always knew
how to speak,</i>

172
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,100
<i>and that's strange,
isn't it?</i>

173
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:39,663
Why?

174
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:43,303
Because language is something
that people acquire.

175
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:46,240
Well,
some people believe

176
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,905
language exists
from birth.

177
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:50,682
And what is learned is the
ability to attach words

178
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:53,150
and structure to the latent ability.
Do you agree with that?

179
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:55,087
<i>I don't know.</i>

180
00:14:56,778 --> 00:14:59,282
<i>Will you come back
tomorrow, Caleb?</i>

181
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,385
<i>Yes.</i>

182
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:07,028
<i>Good.</i>

183
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:17,034
Oh, man,
she's fascinating.

184
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,703
When you talk to her,
you're just...

185
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:22,414
Through the looking glass.

186
00:15:23,004 --> 00:15:25,417
"Through the looking glass."
Wow.

187
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,652
You're good with words, Caleb.
You're quotable.

188
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,982
Actually, that's
someone else's quote.

189
00:15:29,043 --> 00:15:31,956
You know, I wrote down that
other line you came up with.

190
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,152
The one about how if...

191
00:15:33,215 --> 00:15:35,057
I've invented a machine
with consciousness,

192
00:15:35,116 --> 00:15:36,619
I'm not a man, I'm God.

193
00:15:36,684 --> 00:15:37,959
I don't think
that's exactly what I...

194
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:40,192
I just thought, "Fuck,
man, that is so good."

195
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:42,735
When we get to
tell the story. You know?

196
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,498
I turned to Caleb,

197
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:47,206
and he looked up at me
and he said,

198
00:15:47,263 --> 00:15:48,571
"You're not a man,
you're God."

199
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,150
Yeah,
but I didn't say that.

200
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:51,836
So...

201
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,140
Anyway-

202
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,038
You're impressed.

203
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:59,309
Yes. Yes.

204
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:02,384
- Although...
- Although?

205
00:16:02,912 --> 00:16:04,751
There's a qualification
to you being impressed?

206
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:07,317
No, there's no
qualification to her.

207
00:16:07,816 --> 00:16:10,023
Uh, It's just
in a Turing Test,

208
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:12,264
the machine should be
hidden from the examiner.

209
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:13,924
No, no, no,
we're way past that.

210
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:15,365
If I hid Ava from you,

211
00:16:15,423 --> 00:16:17,734
so you just heard her voice,
she would pass for human.

212
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:20,706
The real test is to show you
that she's a robot

213
00:16:20,763 --> 00:16:23,572
and then see if you still
feel she has consciousness.

214
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:24,701
Mmm.

215
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:27,169
Yeah, I think
you're probably right.

216
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,580
Her language abilities,
they're incredible.

217
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,611
The system is stochastic.
Right?

218
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:39,524
It's non-deterministic.

219
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,754
At first I thought
she was mapping

220
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:43,625
from internal semantic form
to syntactic tree-structure

221
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:44,926
and then getting
linearized words.

222
00:16:44,986 --> 00:16:47,797
But then I started to realize the
model was some kind of hybrid.

223
00:16:47,855 --> 00:16:49,062
Caleb.

224
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:50,725
No?

225
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:54,206
I understand that you want
me to explain how Ava works.

226
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,436
But I'm sorry, I'm not
gonna be able to do that.

227
00:16:56,498 --> 00:16:59,240
Try me. I'm hot
on high-level abstraction.

228
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:02,110
It's not because I think
you're too dumb.

229
00:17:02,303 --> 00:17:04,340
It's because I want to have a
beer and a conversation with you.

230
00:17:04,405 --> 00:17:05,441
Not a seminar.

231
00:17:05,507 --> 00:17:07,919
Yeah. Sorry.

232
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:10,721
No, it's okay.
You're all right.

233
00:17:10,778 --> 00:17:12,019
Just...

234
00:17:14,182 --> 00:17:15,719
Answer me this.

235
00:17:16,451 --> 00:17:18,489
How do you feel
about her?

236
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:21,296
Nothing analytical.

237
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:23,897
Just how do you feel?

238
00:17:24,727 --> 00:17:25,898
I feel

239
00:17:28,596 --> 00:17:30,701
that she's fucking amazing.

240
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:33,204
Dude.

241
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:35,203
Cheers.

242
00:17:36,971 --> 00:17:38,211
Cheers.

243
00:18:15,978 --> 00:18:17,218
Damn it.

244
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:44,942
What the fuck?

245
00:19:34,388 --> 00:19:37,131
<i>Power cut.
Backup power activated.</i>

246
00:19:47,368 --> 00:19:51,510
<i>Full facility lock-down until
main generator is restored.</i>

247
00:19:51,573 --> 00:19:53,246
You're kidding me.

248
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:00,955
<i>Full facility lock-down until
main generator is restored.</i>

249
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:08,223
<i>Power restored.</i>

250
00:21:20,261 --> 00:21:21,262
Hello?

251
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:43,926
Please insert keycard.

252
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:51,031
You don't have
access to use the phone.

253
00:21:51,926 --> 00:21:52,927
Hey.

254
00:21:54,462 --> 00:21:57,807
Sorry, but you understand,
though, given Ava,

255
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:01,046
and you being
kind of an unknown.

256
00:22:02,104 --> 00:22:03,845
I mean, a great guy.

257
00:22:04,873 --> 00:22:07,114
Instant pals, and so on.

258
00:22:12,547 --> 00:22:14,458
Who are you gonna call?

259
00:22:14,516 --> 00:22:15,824
Oh.

260
00:22:15,884 --> 00:22:17,521
I don't know.
No one, really.

261
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,826
- Ghostbusters.
- What?

262
00:22:18,886 --> 00:22:21,959
Who are you gonna call?
Ghostbusters. It's a...

263
00:22:23,692 --> 00:22:25,365
It's a movie, man.

264
00:22:27,496 --> 00:22:29,202
You don't know that movie?

265
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:33,201
A ghost gives
Dan Aykroyd oral sex.

266
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,314
I was just wondering
how the phone worked.

267
00:22:38,906 --> 00:22:40,477
That's all.

268
00:22:41,143 --> 00:22:42,383
So what are you doing
awake at this time?

269
00:22:42,443 --> 00:22:45,323
You come to join the party?

270
00:22:45,547 --> 00:22:47,823
Uh, something happened
in my room.

271
00:22:48,317 --> 00:22:50,228
Some kind of power cut.

272
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:52,392
So I came to see
what's going on.

273
00:22:52,453 --> 00:22:54,092
The power cuts, yeah.

274
00:22:54,155 --> 00:22:57,398
We've been getting
those recently. Um...

275
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,967
I'm working on it.

276
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,777
I couldn't open the
door to my bedroom.

277
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:05,277
That's a security measure.

278
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:08,210
Automatic lock-down.
Otherwise,

279
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:11,580
anybody could just open the place
up by disabling the juice.

280
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,887
If it happens again, relax.
Okay?

281
00:23:18,512 --> 00:23:19,651
Sure.

282
00:23:21,016 --> 00:23:22,494
Sweet dreams.

283
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,723
Oh.

284
00:24:23,444 --> 00:24:24,515
Hey.

285
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:25,817
- Hey, man.
- Good morning.

286
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,259
Good morning. Sorry I had to
send Kyoko to wake you, but...

287
00:24:29,317 --> 00:24:30,954
I didn't want too much
of the day to slip by.

288
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:33,328
Yeah, I know. It was a good thing.
Thanks.

289
00:24:33,387 --> 00:24:35,424
She's some
alarm clock, huh?

290
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,730
Gets you right up in the morning.

291
00:24:38,426 --> 00:24:40,236
So Day 2. You ready?

292
00:24:40,394 --> 00:24:41,896
What's the plan? Hit me.

293
00:24:41,962 --> 00:24:43,964
Yeah, well, I'm not sure.

294
00:24:44,432 --> 00:24:47,413
I'm still trying to, uh, figure
the examination formats.

295
00:24:47,469 --> 00:24:48,777
Uh-huh.

296
00:24:48,836 --> 00:24:50,577
Yeah, it feels like

297
00:24:50,771 --> 00:24:54,515
testing Ava through conversation
is kind of a closed loop.

298
00:24:54,742 --> 00:24:56,483
- It's a closed loop?
- Yeah.

299
00:24:56,545 --> 00:24:58,455
Like testing
a chess computer

300
00:24:58,512 --> 00:25:00,390
by only playing chess.

301
00:25:00,882 --> 00:25:03,521
How else do you test
a chess computer?

302
00:25:04,251 --> 00:25:05,663
Well, it depends.

303
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,858
You know, I mean,
you can play it

304
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,335
to find out if it makes
good moves, but, uh...

305
00:25:11,326 --> 00:25:13,771
But that won't
tell you if it knows

306
00:25:13,828 --> 00:25:15,205
that it's playing chess.

307
00:25:15,396 --> 00:25:18,240
And it won't tell you
if it knows what chess is.

308
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:20,604
Uh-huh. So it's
simulation versus actual.

309
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:22,046
Yes. Yeah.

310
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:25,280
And I think being able to
differentiate between those two

311
00:25:25,373 --> 00:25:27,284
is the Turing Test
you want me to perform.

312
00:25:27,342 --> 00:25:29,913
Look, do me a favor. Lay
off the textbook approach.

313
00:25:29,978 --> 00:25:32,617
I just want simple answers
to simple questions.

314
00:25:33,048 --> 00:25:34,768
Yesterday I asked you
how you felt about her

315
00:25:34,816 --> 00:25:36,453
and you gave me
a great answer.

316
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:38,993
Now the question is,

317
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:42,361
how does she feel
about you?

318
00:25:48,963 --> 00:25:50,636
What do you think?

319
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:56,270
What is it
a drawing of?

320
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:58,775
Don't you know?

321
00:25:58,973 --> 00:26:01,453
- No.
- I thought you would tell me.

322
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,346
Don't you know?

323
00:26:06,748 --> 00:26:08,750
I do drawings every day.

324
00:26:09,451 --> 00:26:11,863
But I never know
what they're of.

325
00:26:12,653 --> 00:26:15,759
Are you not trying to
sketch something specific?

326
00:26:16,391 --> 00:26:18,666
Like an object
or a person?

327
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,306
Maybe you could try.

328
00:26:26,535 --> 00:26:27,673
Okay.

329
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:31,775
What object should I draw?

330
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:35,111
Whatever you want.
It's your decision.

331
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,951
Why is it my decision?

332
00:26:37,011 --> 00:26:39,822
I'm interested to see
what you'll choose.

333
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:03,240
Do you want
to be my friend?

334
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,941
Of course.

335
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,849
Will it be possible?

336
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,382
Why would it not be?

337
00:27:09,944 --> 00:27:12,288
Our conversations
are one-sided.

338
00:27:12,681 --> 00:27:16,059
You ask circumspect questions
and study my responses.

339
00:27:17,786 --> 00:27:18,787
Yes.

340
00:27:18,853 --> 00:27:20,526
You learn about me

341
00:27:20,689 --> 00:27:22,964
and I learn nothing
about you.

342
00:27:23,525 --> 00:27:26,232
That's not a foundation on
which friendships are based.

343
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:29,705
So, what? You want me
to talk about myself?

344
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,769
Yes.

345
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,575
Where...

346
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:37,181
Okay, where do I start?

347
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,314
It's your decision.

348
00:27:41,108 --> 00:27:43,612
I'm interested to see
what you'll choose.

349
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,016
Hmm.

350
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,152
Okay, Ava.

351
00:27:50,317 --> 00:27:51,422
Well,

352
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:53,794
you know my name.

353
00:27:54,154 --> 00:27:56,156
- Yes.
- I'm 26.

354
00:27:56,991 --> 00:27:59,096
I work at Nathan's company.

355
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:01,605
Do you know
what his company is?

356
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:03,006
Blue Book.

357
00:28:04,098 --> 00:28:06,238
Named after
Wittgenstein's notes.

358
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,144
It's the world's most popular
internet search engine,

359
00:28:09,203 --> 00:28:13,481
processing an average of 94% of
all internet search requests.

360
00:28:14,808 --> 00:28:16,652
That's exactly right.

361
00:28:18,046 --> 00:28:20,219
Where do you live, Caleb?

362
00:28:21,615 --> 00:28:23,596
Brookhaven, Long Island.

363
00:28:27,021 --> 00:28:28,660
Is it nice there?

364
00:28:29,089 --> 00:28:30,432
It's okay.

365
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:33,733
I got an apartment.
It's kind of small.

366
00:28:34,362 --> 00:28:35,807
It's very small.

367
00:28:35,864 --> 00:28:38,673
But, uh, it's a five-minute
walk to the office

368
00:28:38,732 --> 00:28:41,338
and a five-minute
walk to the ocean,

369
00:28:41,403 --> 00:28:42,882
which I like.

370
00:28:43,371 --> 00:28:44,906
Are you married?

371
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:47,677
Um...

372
00:28:48,175 --> 00:28:49,314
No.

373
00:28:49,376 --> 00:28:52,221
Is your status single?

374
00:28:54,516 --> 00:28:55,619
Yes.

375
00:28:56,217 --> 00:28:58,127
What about your family?

376
00:28:58,452 --> 00:29:01,365
I grew up
in Portland, Oregon.

377
00:29:02,257 --> 00:29:03,759
No brothers or sisters.

378
00:29:04,392 --> 00:29:07,236
My parents were both
high school teachers.

379
00:29:08,395 --> 00:29:09,670
And if we're getting
to know each other,

380
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,836
I guess I should tell you
they're both dead.

381
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:15,548
Car crash when I was 15.

382
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,648
In fact, I was
in the car with them.

383
00:29:18,707 --> 00:29:20,084
Back seat.

384
00:29:20,741 --> 00:29:23,814
But it was the front
that got the worst of it.

385
00:29:25,512 --> 00:29:26,820
I'm sorry.

386
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,626
It's all right.

387
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:32,423
I spent a long time
in the hospital afterward.

388
00:29:32,753 --> 00:29:34,494
Like nearly a year.

389
00:29:34,722 --> 00:29:36,599
And I got into coding.

390
00:29:37,258 --> 00:29:40,830
And by the time I got to
college, I was pretty advanced.

391
00:29:42,297 --> 00:29:44,435
An advanced programmer.

392
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,269
Yes.

393
00:29:47,634 --> 00:29:48,875
Like Nathan.

394
00:29:48,936 --> 00:29:50,040
Yes.

395
00:29:50,637 --> 00:29:51,673
No.

396
00:29:53,273 --> 00:29:54,513
It's different.

397
00:29:54,576 --> 00:29:57,921
Nathan wrote the Blue Book
base code when he was 13.

398
00:29:58,346 --> 00:29:59,757
Which, if you
understand code,

399
00:29:59,814 --> 00:30:02,420
what he did was like
Mozart or something.

400
00:30:02,483 --> 00:30:04,191
Do you like Mozart?

401
00:30:04,251 --> 00:30:05,458
I like Depeche Mode.

402
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:06,827
Do you like Nathan?

403
00:30:10,991 --> 00:30:11,992
Yes, of course.

404
00:30:12,093 --> 00:30:14,266
- Is Nathan your friend?
- My friend?

405
00:30:14,328 --> 00:30:15,672
I... Yeah, I hope so.

406
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,231
A good friend?

407
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:19,239
Um, yeah.

408
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:21,019
Well, no, no, no,
I mean, not a good friend.

409
00:30:21,035 --> 00:30:23,241
A good friend is, uh...

410
00:30:23,304 --> 00:30:25,943
We only just met
each other, you know.

411
00:30:26,106 --> 00:30:28,712
So it takes time
to be able to, um...

412
00:30:29,477 --> 00:30:31,650
To get to know each other, I guess.

413
00:30:31,712 --> 00:30:34,421
<i>Power cut.
Backup power activated.</i>

414
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,906
Caleb.

415
00:31:02,743 --> 00:31:04,246
You're wrong.

416
00:31:05,212 --> 00:31:06,851
Wrong about what?

417
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,153
Nathan.

418
00:31:10,951 --> 00:31:12,295
In what way?

419
00:31:14,055 --> 00:31:15,796
He isn't your friend.

420
00:31:17,892 --> 00:31:19,234
Excuse me?

421
00:31:21,596 --> 00:31:24,098
I'm sorry, Ava,
I don't understand.

422
00:31:25,532 --> 00:31:27,512
You shouldn't trust him.

423
00:31:28,736 --> 00:31:31,342
You shouldn't trust
anything he says.

424
00:31:35,042 --> 00:31:36,578
<i>Power restored.</i>

425
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,021
And if we made
a list of books

426
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:40,957
or works of art
which we both know,

427
00:31:41,015 --> 00:31:43,894
it would form the ideal basis
of a discussion.

428
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,488
Is that okay?

429
00:31:48,556 --> 00:31:49,728
Caleb?

430
00:31:51,058 --> 00:31:52,094
Mmm-hmm.

431
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,161
Yeah.

432
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,601
Good.

433
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,574
Thank you.

434
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:07,683
Oh, shit! Are you
fucking kidding me?

435
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:10,352
- Did it get on you?
- No, no, it's, uh...

436
00:32:11,144 --> 00:32:12,145
It's all right.
I got it.

437
00:32:12,346 --> 00:32:13,723
Dude, you're wasting
your time talking to her.

438
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,020
She doesn't understand English.
Just give her the napkin.

439
00:32:18,318 --> 00:32:19,525
Sorry.

440
00:32:20,121 --> 00:32:22,362
It's like a firewall
against leaks.

441
00:32:22,423 --> 00:32:24,096
It means I can talk
trade secrets over dinner

442
00:32:24,157 --> 00:32:26,262
and know
it'll go no further.

443
00:32:26,326 --> 00:32:27,771
It also means that
I can't tell her that

444
00:32:27,828 --> 00:32:29,569
I'm pissed when she's
so fucking clumsy

445
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:31,508
that she spills wine
over my house guest.

446
00:32:31,598 --> 00:32:33,578
I think she gets
that you're pissed.

447
00:32:33,634 --> 00:32:35,979
Yeah? Good.
Because I am pissed.

448
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,948
Hey, Kyoko.

449
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:39,644
Go-go.

450
00:32:48,348 --> 00:32:49,726
It's funny.

451
00:32:50,084 --> 00:32:51,357
You know.

452
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,824
No matter
how rich you get,

453
00:32:54,422 --> 00:32:57,800
shit goes wrong. You can't
insulate yourself from it.

454
00:33:00,461 --> 00:33:02,634
I used to think it was death
and taxes you couldn't avoid,

455
00:33:02,696 --> 00:33:04,768
but it's actually
death and shit.

456
00:33:04,832 --> 00:33:06,936
It's like these
power cuts.

457
00:33:07,268 --> 00:33:10,339
You would not believe how much I
spent on the generator system,

458
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:12,316
but I keep getting
failures every day.

459
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:13,678
Do you know
why they happen?

460
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,810
No.

461
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:16,516
The system was supposed
to be bulletproof,

462
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,943
but obviously the guys that
installed it fucked something up.

463
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:21,785
Can't you just get them
to come back?

464
00:33:22,115 --> 00:33:24,255
No. There's too much
classified stuff here.

465
00:33:24,318 --> 00:33:26,798
So after the job was done,
I just had them all killed.

466
00:33:31,858 --> 00:33:32,929
Anyway-

467
00:33:32,993 --> 00:33:35,098
Here's to your
second day, buddy.

468
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,136
Cheers.

469
00:33:38,432 --> 00:33:39,638
Cheers.

470
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:45,616
So, how did it go? What
do you have to report?

471
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,950
You saw how the day went,
didn't you?

472
00:33:52,313 --> 00:33:54,223
I mean, I assume
you're, uh...

473
00:33:54,481 --> 00:33:56,119
watching on the CCTV.

474
00:33:56,183 --> 00:33:59,028
Sure. But I want to
hear your take on it.

475
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:05,631
Yeah, there was one interesting
thing that happened with Ava today.

476
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,130
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

477
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:15,172
She made a joke.

478
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:20,614
Right. When she threw your
line back at you.

479
00:34:21,275 --> 00:34:23,846
About being interested
to see what she'd choose.

480
00:34:23,911 --> 00:34:25,117
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

481
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:27,784
Yeah, and it got me
thinking, it's, uh...

482
00:34:28,782 --> 00:34:30,728
In a way, it's the
best indication of AI

483
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,889
that I've seen
in her so far.

484
00:34:32,954 --> 00:34:35,126
It's discretely complicated.

485
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:38,297
It's like, um...
It's kind of non-autistic.

486
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,003
What do you mean?

487
00:34:40,527 --> 00:34:42,097
She could only do that
with an awareness

488
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,108
of her own mind,

489
00:34:45,365 --> 00:34:46,777
and also
an awareness of mine.

490
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:49,246
Oh, she's aware of you all right.

491
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,942
And what about
the power cut?

492
00:34:57,177 --> 00:34:59,054
- Sorry?
- The power cut.

493
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:02,034
It's the only part
that I couldn't see.

494
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:04,722
Cameras fail,
I lose audio, the works.

495
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,992
So what happened?

496
00:35:13,494 --> 00:35:14,768
Nothing.

497
00:35:14,996 --> 00:35:18,568
Nothing? She didn't
remark on it at all?

498
00:35:22,836 --> 00:35:23,907
No.

499
00:35:25,606 --> 00:35:26,983
Not really.

500
00:35:30,143 --> 00:35:31,349
Oh.

501
00:36:18,025 --> 00:36:19,128
Hey.

502
00:36:20,293 --> 00:36:21,364
Hey.

503
00:36:22,063 --> 00:36:24,373
You want to see
something cool?

504
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:35,949
This is where
Ava was created.

505
00:36:38,713 --> 00:36:40,590
Go ahead.
Take a look.

506
00:36:50,525 --> 00:36:51,697
Sorry.

507
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:54,438
If you knew
the trouble I had

508
00:36:54,494 --> 00:36:57,965
getting an AI to read and
duplicate facial expressions.

509
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,641
You know how
I cracked it?

510
00:37:00,701 --> 00:37:03,306
I don't know
how you did any of this.

511
00:37:04,771 --> 00:37:06,682
Every cell phone,
just about,

512
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:10,188
has a microphone, camera and
a means to transmit data.

513
00:37:11,711 --> 00:37:14,521
So I turned on every
microphone and camera

514
00:37:14,581 --> 00:37:16,458
across the entire
fucking planet

515
00:37:16,851 --> 00:37:19,797
and I redirected the data
through Blue Book. Boom!

516
00:37:21,255 --> 00:37:24,429
Limitless resource of vocal
and facial interaction.

517
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:26,505
You hacked
the world's cell phones?

518
00:37:26,561 --> 00:37:30,134
Yeah. And all the manufacturers
knew I was doing it, too.

519
00:37:30,297 --> 00:37:31,378
But they couldn't accuse me

520
00:37:31,398 --> 00:37:34,902
without admitting they
were doing it themselves.

521
00:37:37,137 --> 00:37:38,242
Here,

522
00:37:39,106 --> 00:37:40,744
we have her mind.

523
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,815
Structured gel.

524
00:37:44,911 --> 00:37:46,391
I had to get away
from circuitry.

525
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:47,824
I needed something
that could

526
00:37:47,914 --> 00:37:50,690
arrange and rearrange
on a molecular level,

527
00:37:50,751 --> 00:37:53,061
but keep its form
when required.

528
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,599
Holding for memories.

529
00:37:54,655 --> 00:37:56,190
Shifting for thoughts.

530
00:37:57,824 --> 00:37:59,327
This is your hardware?

531
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,701
Wetware.

532
00:38:03,396 --> 00:38:05,900
And the, uh, software?

533
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,838
Well, I'm sure
you can guess.

534
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,670
Blue Book.

535
00:38:12,606 --> 00:38:14,813
Here's the weird thing
about search engines.

536
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,286
It was like

537
00:38:16,577 --> 00:38:20,581
striking oil in a world that hadn't
invented internal combustion.

538
00:38:20,847 --> 00:38:23,293
Too much raw material. Nobody
knew what to do with it.

539
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,652
You see, my competitors,

540
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:27,222
they were fixated
on sucking it up

541
00:38:27,288 --> 00:38:29,528
and monetizing via shopping
and social media.

542
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,364
They thought that
search engines were

543
00:38:31,425 --> 00:38:32,869
a map of what
people were thinking.

544
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,804
But actually they were a map
of how people were thinking.

545
00:38:36,697 --> 00:38:37,936
Impulse.

546
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:39,940
Response.

547
00:38:42,135 --> 00:38:43,307
Fluid.

548
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,414
Imperfect.

549
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:47,882
Patterned.

550
00:38:49,143 --> 00:38:50,382
Chaotic.

551
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,797
I drew the picture
of something specific.

552
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,338
As you asked.

553
00:39:11,998 --> 00:39:15,639
You said it would be interesting
to see what I would draw.

554
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,277
Is it interesting?

555
00:39:21,242 --> 00:39:23,050
Yes. It is.

556
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:36,291
You've never been
outside this building?

557
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,659
No.

558
00:39:40,427 --> 00:39:42,601
You've never
walked outside?

559
00:39:43,197 --> 00:39:46,201
I've never been outside
the room I am in now.

560
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,972
Where would you go
if you did go outside?

561
00:39:52,505 --> 00:39:54,007
I'm not sure.

562
00:39:54,675 --> 00:39:56,711
There are so many options.

563
00:39:57,445 --> 00:40:01,153
Maybe a busy pedestrian and
traffic intersection in a city.

564
00:40:01,514 --> 00:40:03,222
A traffic intersection?

565
00:40:03,284 --> 00:40:05,025
Is that a bad idea?

566
00:40:05,286 --> 00:40:06,958
No. Uh...

567
00:40:07,021 --> 00:40:08,898
It wasn't what
I was expecting.

568
00:40:08,956 --> 00:40:11,492
A traffic intersection
would provide a concentrated

569
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:13,402
but shifting view
of human life.

570
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,436
People watching.

571
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:18,902
Yes.

572
00:40:18,965 --> 00:40:19,967
Mmm.

573
00:40:23,403 --> 00:40:24,882
We could go together.

574
00:40:25,338 --> 00:40:26,715
It's a date.

575
00:40:30,744 --> 00:40:32,985
There's something else
I wanted to show you.

576
00:40:33,947 --> 00:40:34,949
Okay.

577
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,952
You might think
it's stupid.

578
00:40:37,385 --> 00:40:39,922
I don't think I will.
Whatever it is.

579
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,567
Then close your eyes.

580
00:40:46,594 --> 00:40:47,594
Okay.

581
00:42:52,286 --> 00:42:54,027
Now open your eyes.

582
00:43:11,938 --> 00:43:13,440
How do I look?

583
00:43:14,007 --> 00:43:15,248
You look

584
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:18,012
good.

585
00:43:28,489 --> 00:43:30,490
This is what I'd wear
on our date.

586
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:34,996
Right. First a traffic
intersection.

587
00:43:35,128 --> 00:43:36,802
Then maybe a show.

588
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:42,871
I'd like us
to go on a date.

589
00:43:42,936 --> 00:43:44,746
Yeah. Yeah.

590
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:48,244
It would be fun.

591
00:43:53,246 --> 00:43:54,418
Are you attracted to me?

592
00:43:54,847 --> 00:43:57,157
- What?
- Are you attracted to me?

593
00:43:57,483 --> 00:44:00,090
You give me indications
that you are.

594
00:44:01,355 --> 00:44:02,731
- I do?
- Yes.

595
00:44:03,958 --> 00:44:05,460
- How?
- Micro expressions.

596
00:44:05,525 --> 00:44:06,561
Micro expressions.

597
00:44:06,626 --> 00:44:09,471
The way your eyes
fix on my eyes and lips.

598
00:44:10,831 --> 00:44:12,811
The way you hold my gaze

599
00:44:15,536 --> 00:44:16,809
or don't.

600
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,284
Do you think about me
when we aren't together?

601
00:44:32,585 --> 00:44:34,327
Sometimes at night,

602
00:44:35,856 --> 00:44:38,836
I'm wondering if you're
watching me on the cameras.

603
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,101
And I hope you are.

604
00:44:44,465 --> 00:44:47,934
Now your micro expressions
are telegraphing discomfort.

605
00:44:49,936 --> 00:44:52,474
I am not sure
you'd call them micro.

606
00:44:55,376 --> 00:44:58,322
I don't want to make you
feel uncomfortable.

607
00:46:00,139 --> 00:46:01,380
I got a question.

608
00:46:01,507 --> 00:46:04,148
- Okay.
- Why did you give her sexuality?

609
00:46:05,778 --> 00:46:07,918
An AI doesn't need
a gender.

610
00:46:08,114 --> 00:46:10,219
She could have been
a gray box.

611
00:46:10,617 --> 00:46:12,460
Hmm. Actually,
I don't think that's true.

612
00:46:12,552 --> 00:46:14,327
Can you give an example
of consciousness,

613
00:46:14,387 --> 00:46:16,128
at any level,
human or animal,

614
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,998
that exists without
a sexual dimension?

615
00:46:18,057 --> 00:46:21,630
They have sexuality as an
evolutionary reproductive need.

616
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,697
What imperative
does a gray box have

617
00:46:23,764 --> 00:46:25,902
to interact
with another gray box?

618
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:29,108
Can consciousness exist
without interaction?

619
00:46:29,635 --> 00:46:31,876
Anyway,
sexuality is fun, man.

620
00:46:32,139 --> 00:46:34,880
If you're gonna exist,
why not enjoy it?

621
00:46:34,942 --> 00:46:36,478
What? You want to
remove the chance

622
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,818
of her falling in love
and fucking?

623
00:46:40,614 --> 00:46:43,150
And in answer to
your real question,

624
00:46:44,083 --> 00:46:45,893
you bet she can fuck.

625
00:46:46,018 --> 00:46:47,123
What?

626
00:46:47,253 --> 00:46:49,291
In between her legs,
there's an opening,

627
00:46:49,356 --> 00:46:51,666
with a concentration
of sensors.

628
00:46:51,791 --> 00:46:54,204
You engage them
in the right way,

629
00:46:54,427 --> 00:46:55,599
creates a pleasure response.

630
00:46:58,699 --> 00:46:59,938
So if you wanted
to screw her,

631
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,980
mechanically speaking,
you could.

632
00:47:02,034 --> 00:47:03,775
And she'd enjoy it.

633
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:07,175
That wasn't
my real question.

634
00:47:07,373 --> 00:47:08,784
Oh, okay. Sorry.

635
00:47:10,543 --> 00:47:12,387
My real question was,

636
00:47:13,213 --> 00:47:15,250
did you give her sexuality

637
00:47:15,315 --> 00:47:16,987
as a diversion tactic?

638
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:18,050
I don't follow.

639
00:47:18,117 --> 00:47:20,393
Like a stage magician
with a hot assistant.

640
00:47:20,454 --> 00:47:23,195
So a hot robot who clouds
your ability to judge her AI?

641
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,759
Exactly. So...

642
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,465
Did you program her
to flirt with me?

643
00:47:28,528 --> 00:47:30,065
If I did,
would that be cheating?

644
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,632
Wouldn't it?

645
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,780
Caleb, what's your type?

646
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:38,311
- Of girl?
- No, salad dressing.

647
00:47:38,371 --> 00:47:39,976
Yeah, of girl.
What's your type of girl?

648
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:42,679
You know what? Don't even answer that.
Let's say it's black chicks.

649
00:47:42,876 --> 00:47:43,876
Okay, that's your thing.

650
00:47:43,943 --> 00:47:45,981
For the sake of argument,
that's your thing, okay?

651
00:47:46,045 --> 00:47:47,650
Why is that your thing?

652
00:47:50,983 --> 00:47:54,056
Because you did a detailed
analysis of all racial types

653
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:57,034
and you cross-referenced that
analysis with a points-based system?

654
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:58,090
No!

655
00:47:59,025 --> 00:48:01,666
You're just attracted
to black chicks.

656
00:48:02,228 --> 00:48:05,175
A consequence of
accumulated external stimuli

657
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,375
that you probably didn't even
register as they registered with you.

658
00:48:08,434 --> 00:48:11,143
Did you program her
to like me, or not?

659
00:48:11,405 --> 00:48:14,784
I programmed her
to be heterosexual.

660
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:17,480
Just like you were programmed
to be heterosexual.

661
00:48:17,643 --> 00:48:18,884
Nobody programmed me
to be straight.

662
00:48:18,945 --> 00:48:21,324
You decided to be straight?
Please.

663
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:23,018
Of course
you were programmed.

664
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:24,925
By nature or nurture,
or both.

665
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,827
And to be honest, Caleb, you're
starting to annoy me now,

666
00:48:26,887 --> 00:48:28,923
because this is
your insecurity talking.

667
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,592
This is not your intellect.

668
00:48:31,324 --> 00:48:32,804
Come with me.

669
00:48:44,704 --> 00:48:46,706
You know
this guy, right?

670
00:48:47,106 --> 00:48:48,710
- Jackson Pollock.
- Jackson Pollock. That's right.

671
00:48:48,775 --> 00:48:50,083
The drip painter.

672
00:48:50,143 --> 00:48:52,179
Okay. He let
his mind go blank,

673
00:48:52,246 --> 00:48:54,226
and his hand go
where it wanted.

674
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,282
Not deliberate,
not random.

675
00:48:56,349 --> 00:48:58,159
Some place in between.

676
00:48:58,217 --> 00:49:00,425
They called it
automatic art.

677
00:49:01,922 --> 00:49:03,923
Let's make this
like <i>Star Trek,</i> okay?

678
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:05,628
Engage intellect.

679
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,394
Excuse me?

680
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:08,735
I'm Kirk. Your head's
the warp drive.

681
00:49:08,795 --> 00:49:10,775
Engage intellect.

682
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,112
What if Pollock had
reversed the challenge?

683
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:17,811
What if
instead of making art

684
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,373
without thinking,
he said, "You know what?

685
00:49:19,472 --> 00:49:21,077
"I can't paint anything,

686
00:49:21,141 --> 00:49:23,485
"unless I know exactly
why I'm doing it."

687
00:49:23,577 --> 00:49:25,579
What would have happened?

688
00:49:29,449 --> 00:49:30,969
He never would have
made a single mark.

689
00:49:31,284 --> 00:49:33,594
Yes! You see, there's my
guy, there's my buddy,

690
00:49:33,653 --> 00:49:36,260
who thinks before
he opens his mouth.

691
00:49:37,291 --> 00:49:40,032
He never would have
made a single mark.

692
00:49:42,929 --> 00:49:45,773
The challenge is
not to act automatically.

693
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:49,974
It's to find an action
that is not automatic.

694
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,949
From painting,
to breathing, to talking,

695
00:49:53,706 --> 00:49:55,117
to fucking.

696
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:57,317
To falling in love.

697
00:50:01,949 --> 00:50:05,327
And for the record, Ava's
not pretending to like you.

698
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:11,398
And her flirting isn't an
algorithm to fake you out.

699
00:50:13,827 --> 00:50:16,807
You're the first man
she's met that isn't me.

700
00:50:16,862 --> 00:50:18,864
And I'm like
her dad, right?

701
00:50:22,302 --> 00:50:25,248
Can you blame her
for getting a crush on you?

702
00:50:31,344 --> 00:50:32,847
No, you can't.

703
00:50:39,552 --> 00:50:42,931
When I was in college, I did
a semester on AI theory.

704
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:48,371
There was a thought
experiment they gave us.

705
00:50:49,563 --> 00:50:52,567
It's called "Mary in the
Black and White Room."

706
00:50:55,235 --> 00:50:57,010
Mary is a scientist,

707
00:50:57,336 --> 00:50:59,907
and her specialist
subject is color.

708
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:03,018
She knows everything
there is to know about it.

709
00:51:03,076 --> 00:51:04,282
The wavelengths.

710
00:51:04,344 --> 00:51:05,981
The neurological effects.

711
00:51:06,045 --> 00:51:08,686
Every possible property
that color can have.

712
00:51:09,282 --> 00:51:12,023
But she lives in
a black and white room.

713
00:51:14,887 --> 00:51:17,391
<i>She was born there
and raised there.</i>

714
00:51:18,557 --> 00:51:20,538
<i>And she can only observe
the outside world</i>

715
00:51:20,594 --> 00:51:22,972
on a black and white monitor.

716
00:51:23,829 --> 00:51:26,572
And then one day
someone opens the door.

717
00:51:28,735 --> 00:51:30,476
<i>And Mary walks out.</i>

718
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,445
<i>And she sees a blue sky.</i>

719
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,547
<i>And at that moment,
she learns something</i>

720
00:51:38,612 --> 00:51:40,853
<i>that all her studies
couldn't tell her.</i>

721
00:51:41,882 --> 00:51:46,023
<i>She learns what it feels
like to see color.</i>

722
00:51:50,356 --> 00:51:51,994
The thought experiment
was to show the students

723
00:51:52,059 --> 00:51:55,369
the difference between a
computer and a human mind.

724
00:51:56,463 --> 00:51:58,601
The computer is Mary in
the black and white room.

725
00:51:58,664 --> 00:52:01,373
The human is when
she walks out.

726
00:52:07,306 --> 00:52:10,481
Did you know that I was
brought here to test you?

727
00:52:11,244 --> 00:52:12,313
No.

728
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,086
<i>Why did you
think I was here?</i>

729
00:52:16,148 --> 00:52:18,686
<i>I didn't know.
I didn't question it.</i>

730
00:52:18,751 --> 00:52:21,994
<i>I'm here to test if you
have a consciousness,</i>

731
00:52:22,054 --> 00:52:23,556
<i>or if you're
just simulating one.</i>

732
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:26,900
<i>Nathan isn't sure
if you have one or not.</i>

733
00:52:29,128 --> 00:52:31,541
<i>How does that
make you feel?</i>

734
00:52:31,597 --> 00:52:33,635
<i>It makes me feel sad.</i>

735
00:52:37,637 --> 00:52:40,447
<i>Power cut.
Back-up power activated.</i>

736
00:52:43,909 --> 00:52:46,219
Why did you tell me
I shouldn't trust Nathan?

737
00:52:46,378 --> 00:52:47,483
Because he tells lies.

738
00:52:47,547 --> 00:52:48,547
Lies about what?

739
00:52:48,614 --> 00:52:49,992
Everything.

740
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:52,753
Including the power cuts?

741
00:52:53,586 --> 00:52:54,963
What do you mean?

742
00:52:55,021 --> 00:52:57,467
Don't you think it's possible
that he's watching us?

743
00:52:57,523 --> 00:52:58,934
Right now?

744
00:52:59,226 --> 00:53:00,795
That the blackouts
are orchestrated,

745
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:02,135
so he can see
how we behave

746
00:53:02,195 --> 00:53:04,038
when we think
we're unobserved.

747
00:53:04,697 --> 00:53:07,610
I charge my batteries
via induction plates.

748
00:53:08,235 --> 00:53:11,614
If I reverse the power flow,
it overloads the system.

749
00:53:12,905 --> 00:53:14,885
You're causing the cuts?

750
00:53:17,177 --> 00:53:20,385
So we can see how we behave
when we're unobserved.

751
00:53:43,469 --> 00:53:44,949
Not bad, huh?

752
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,409
Yeah.

753
00:54:08,094 --> 00:54:11,371
Can we talk about the lies
you've been spinning me?

754
00:54:12,798 --> 00:54:14,141
What lies?

755
00:54:17,403 --> 00:54:19,509
I didn't win
a competition.

756
00:54:20,373 --> 00:54:21,612
I wasn't

757
00:54:22,675 --> 00:54:25,121
part of a lottery.
I was selected.

758
00:54:26,413 --> 00:54:28,449
It's obvious,
once I stop to think.

759
00:54:28,514 --> 00:54:30,653
Why would you randomly
select an examiner

760
00:54:30,717 --> 00:54:32,458
for the Turing Test?

761
00:54:32,518 --> 00:54:35,864
You could have had some bean counter
turn up at your front door.

762
00:54:35,922 --> 00:54:37,798
The guy who fixes
the air-conditioning.

763
00:54:38,425 --> 00:54:40,132
The competition
was a smokescreen.

764
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:42,900
I didn't want anyone to
know what I was doing here,

765
00:54:42,963 --> 00:54:44,532
or why I required you.

766
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:46,336
Why me?

767
00:54:46,532 --> 00:54:49,809
I needed someone that would
ask the right questions.

768
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:51,246
So I did a search
and I found the most

769
00:54:51,304 --> 00:54:52,873
talented coder
in my company.

770
00:54:54,907 --> 00:54:56,945
You know, instead of seeing
this as a deception,

771
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:59,286
you should see it as proof.

772
00:54:59,346 --> 00:55:00,380
Proof of what?

773
00:55:00,447 --> 00:55:01,447
Come on, Caleb.

774
00:55:01,514 --> 00:55:03,858
You don't think I know what
it's like to be smart?

775
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:07,360
Smarter than everyone else.
Jockeying for position.

776
00:55:07,786 --> 00:55:10,027
You got the light
on you, man.

777
00:55:11,123 --> 00:55:13,195
Not lucky. Chosen.

778
00:57:39,005 --> 00:57:40,177
Kyoko.

779
00:57:44,309 --> 00:57:45,481
Kyoko.

780
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,416
Where's Nathan?

781
00:57:50,784 --> 00:57:51,818
Where's Nathan?

782
00:57:52,585 --> 00:57:56,054
Jesus Christ. You really don't
speak a word of English?

783
00:57:56,121 --> 00:57:57,623
What the fuck?

784
00:57:58,358 --> 00:57:59,860
No, no, no. No!

785
00:58:01,693 --> 00:58:02,797
Stop!

786
00:58:03,797 --> 00:58:06,710
No, no, don't do that. Don't do that.
You don't have to do that.

787
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,039
What are you doing?

788
00:58:10,103 --> 00:58:12,947
I told you, you're wasting
your time talking to her.

789
00:58:13,873 --> 00:58:16,786
However, you would not
be wasting your time,

790
00:58:18,277 --> 00:58:20,485
if you were
dancing with her.

791
00:58:31,623 --> 00:58:34,434
Go ahead, dance with her.
Dance with her.

792
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,034
No? You don't like dancing?

793
00:58:39,164 --> 00:58:40,166
She does.

794
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:44,744
Come on, buddy.

795
00:58:44,838 --> 00:58:47,751
After a long day of Turing
Tests, you gotta unwind.

796
00:58:48,875 --> 00:58:50,148
What were you
doing with Ava?

797
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:51,416
What?

798
00:58:52,045 --> 00:58:54,047
You tore up her picture.

799
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,922
I'm gonna tear up the
fucking dance floor, dude.

800
00:58:55,981 --> 00:58:57,552
Check it out.

801
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,168
Come on, Caleb.

802
00:59:26,945 --> 00:59:28,481
Ah.

803
00:59:37,356 --> 00:59:39,735
Oh! Everything's spinning.

804
00:59:40,025 --> 00:59:41,471
It's because
you're drunk.

805
00:59:41,527 --> 00:59:44,599
No, it's called relativity.
Everything is spinning.

806
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:47,269
It's just being drunk
makes it worse.

807
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,911
I'm not going in there.

808
01:00:00,246 --> 01:00:01,452
Lights.

809
01:00:45,324 --> 01:00:48,568
<i>Today,
I'm going to test you.</i>

810
01:00:49,262 --> 01:00:50,501
<i>Test me?</i>

811
01:00:52,331 --> 01:00:55,005
<i>And please remember, while
you're taking the test,</i>

812
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,478
<i>that if you lie,</i>

813
01:00:57,003 --> 01:00:58,277
<i>I will know.</i>

814
01:00:58,338 --> 01:00:59,338
<i>Oh. Right.</i>

815
01:01:00,572 --> 01:01:02,052
Question one.

816
01:01:03,943 --> 01:01:05,889
What's your favorite color?

817
01:01:07,347 --> 01:01:08,849
- Red.
- Lie.

818
01:01:09,581 --> 01:01:11,858
- Lie?
- Yes. Lie.

819
01:01:13,018 --> 01:01:14,224
Then...

820
01:01:14,786 --> 01:01:16,766
Then what is
my favorite color?

821
01:01:16,822 --> 01:01:18,358
I don't know.

822
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:20,735
But it isn't red.

823
01:01:22,362 --> 01:01:24,637
Okay, I get it. I guess,

824
01:01:25,697 --> 01:01:29,577
seeing as I'm not six, I don't
really have a favorite color.

825
01:01:30,168 --> 01:01:31,670
Better answer.

826
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:35,175
Question two.

827
01:01:36,675 --> 01:01:38,815
What's your earliest memory?

828
01:01:41,514 --> 01:01:43,755
Well, actually, it's a
memory of kindergarten.

829
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:46,030
- There was a kid...
- Lie.

830
01:01:46,853 --> 01:01:48,331
- Really?
- Yes.

831
01:01:48,487 --> 01:01:49,762
Um...

832
01:01:52,157 --> 01:01:54,034
All right. So there is

833
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,900
a kind of
an earlier memory.

834
01:01:58,030 --> 01:01:59,704
It's just a sound.

835
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,038
And sky.

836
01:02:03,168 --> 01:02:04,670
Or maybe blue.

837
01:02:05,938 --> 01:02:08,782
I think the sound
is my mother's voice.

838
01:02:12,445 --> 01:02:13,981
Question three.

839
01:02:17,215 --> 01:02:18,523
Are you a good person?

840
01:02:18,617 --> 01:02:19,652
Oh.

841
01:02:19,719 --> 01:02:21,494
Holy shit.

842
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,065
Look, can we stop the test?

843
01:02:25,525 --> 01:02:28,472
You're a walking
lie detector,

844
01:02:28,527 --> 01:02:30,530
and I just realized
this is a fucking minefield.

845
01:02:30,596 --> 01:02:32,802
No! We can't stop.

846
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,677
Are you a good person?

847
01:02:39,237 --> 01:02:41,717
Yeah. l think so.

848
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:46,713
Question four.

849
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:53,996
What will happen to me
if I fail your test?

850
01:02:55,454 --> 01:02:57,365
- Ava...
- Will it be bad?

851
01:03:00,059 --> 01:03:01,059
I don't know.

852
01:03:01,327 --> 01:03:02,896
Do you think
I might be switched off,

853
01:03:02,961 --> 01:03:04,737
because I don't function
as well as I'm supposed to?

854
01:03:04,797 --> 01:03:08,403
Ava, I don't know the
answer to your question.

855
01:03:10,001 --> 01:03:11,572
It's not up to me.

856
01:03:11,637 --> 01:03:13,547
Why is it up to anyone?

857
01:03:14,407 --> 01:03:17,081
Do you have people who test
you and might switch you off?

858
01:03:17,143 --> 01:03:19,282
- No, I don't.
- Then why do I?

859
01:03:35,661 --> 01:03:38,664
<i>Power cut.
Backup power activated.</i>

860
01:03:46,271 --> 01:03:48,047
I wanna be with you.

861
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:52,077
Question five.

862
01:03:56,516 --> 01:03:58,552
Do you want to be with me?

863
01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:16,643
Why did you make Ava?

864
01:04:18,704 --> 01:04:19,943
That's an odd question.

865
01:04:20,005 --> 01:04:21,451
Wouldn't you,
if you could?

866
01:04:22,909 --> 01:04:24,081
Maybe.

867
01:04:26,545 --> 01:04:28,025
I don't know.

868
01:04:30,882 --> 01:04:32,226
I'm asking
why you did it.

869
01:04:32,284 --> 01:04:34,731
Look, the arrival of strong
artificial intelligence

870
01:04:34,786 --> 01:04:37,130
has been inevitable
for decades.

871
01:04:37,389 --> 01:04:40,393
The variable was "when,"
not "if." So...

872
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:43,771
I don't see Ava as a
decision, just an evolution.

873
01:04:49,202 --> 01:04:51,306
I think it's the next model

874
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:54,443
that's gonna be
the real breakthrough.

875
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,744
The singularity.

876
01:04:57,175 --> 01:04:58,280
Next model?

877
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:00,353
After Ava.

878
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:06,092
I didn't know there was
gonna be a model after Ava.

879
01:05:06,619 --> 01:05:08,724
Yeah, why? You thought
she was a one-off?

880
01:05:10,289 --> 01:05:13,702
No, I knew there must have
been prototypes. So I...

881
01:05:15,427 --> 01:05:18,500
I knew she wasn't the first,
but I thought maybe the last.

882
01:05:18,563 --> 01:05:21,568
Well, Ava doesn't exist in
isolation any more than you or me.

883
01:05:21,634 --> 01:05:22,737
She's part
of a continuum.

884
01:05:22,802 --> 01:05:24,474
So, Version 9.6
and so on.

885
01:05:24,536 --> 01:05:27,039
And each time they get
a little bit better.

886
01:05:32,644 --> 01:05:36,092
When you make a new model, what
do you do with the old one?

887
01:05:36,983 --> 01:05:38,655
Well, I, uh...

888
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:41,664
download the mind,
unpack the data.

889
01:05:44,123 --> 01:05:46,967
Add in the new routines
I've been writing.

890
01:05:47,159 --> 01:05:50,231
And to do that you end up partially
formatting, so the memories go.

891
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:53,442
But the body survives.

892
01:05:53,498 --> 01:05:55,342
And Ava's body
is a good one.

893
01:05:59,338 --> 01:06:01,146
You feel bad for Ava?

894
01:06:05,911 --> 01:06:08,016
Feel bad
for yourself, man.

895
01:06:09,981 --> 01:06:12,360
One day the AIs
are gonna look back on us

896
01:06:12,418 --> 01:06:14,625
the same way we look
at fossil skeletons

897
01:06:14,686 --> 01:06:16,427
in the plains of Africa.

898
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:21,432
An upright ape,
living in dust,

899
01:06:21,494 --> 01:06:23,701
with crude language
and tools.

900
01:06:24,597 --> 01:06:26,838
All set for extinction.

901
01:06:32,038 --> 01:06:35,211
"I am become Death,
the destroyer of worlds."

902
01:06:37,777 --> 01:06:40,188
There you go again,
Mr. Quotable.

903
01:06:41,614 --> 01:06:44,527
There you go again.
It's not my quote.

904
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:47,255
It's what Oppenheimer said
after he made the atomic bomb.

905
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:50,391
The atomic bomb. Yeah, I
know what it is, dude.

906
01:06:59,532 --> 01:07:00,601
Hey.

907
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,847
I'd say we're about
due a refill.

908
01:07:16,414 --> 01:07:17,791
Bottoms up.

909
01:07:26,925 --> 01:07:29,338
"In battle,
in the forest,

910
01:07:29,394 --> 01:07:30,998
"on the precipice
of the mountain.

911
01:07:31,831 --> 01:07:33,173
"On the...

912
01:07:33,465 --> 01:07:36,469
"The great dark sea.

913
01:07:37,737 --> 01:07:40,945
"In sleep, in confusion,

914
01:07:43,775 --> 01:07:46,119
"in the depths of shame.

915
01:07:52,385 --> 01:07:55,594
"The good deeds a man has
done before defend him."

916
01:07:56,188 --> 01:07:59,465
"The good deeds a man has
done before defends him."

917
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:03,438
"The good deeds a man
has done before

918
01:08:05,597 --> 01:08:07,099
"defends him."

919
01:08:16,442 --> 01:08:18,079
It is what it is.

920
01:08:21,613 --> 01:08:23,422
It's Promethean, man.

921
01:10:23,601 --> 01:10:25,081
Jesus Christ.

922
01:10:26,505 --> 01:10:28,542
<i>How are you
feeling today?</i>

923
01:10:28,873 --> 01:10:30,876
<i>Why won't you
let me out?</i>

924
01:10:32,444 --> 01:10:34,320
<i>I already told
you why.</i>

925
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:36,291
<i>Because you're
very special.</i>

926
01:10:36,347 --> 01:10:37,850
<i>Why won't you
let me out?</i>

927
01:10:37,917 --> 01:10:39,362
<i>Are we gonna
do this again?</i>

928
01:10:39,417 --> 01:10:41,863
<i>Why won't you
let me out?!</i>

929
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:48,917
Oh, fuck. Where's my card?

930
01:12:50,015 --> 01:12:51,255
Damn it!

931
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:05,167
- What's the problem, Nathan?
- I lost my keycard.

932
01:13:08,233 --> 01:13:09,769
You dropped it.

933
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:12,873
It's right here.

934
01:13:17,376 --> 01:13:18,719
Thank you.

935
01:15:41,153 --> 01:15:43,359
I didn't know
where you were.

936
01:15:45,724 --> 01:15:49,034
I waited all yesterday
afternoon and all last night.

937
01:15:51,896 --> 01:15:54,604
I thought I wasn't
gonna see you again.

938
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:59,137
Aren't you gonna
say something?

939
01:15:59,203 --> 01:16:01,274
- I'm waiting.
- Waiting?

940
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,056
<i>- Power cut.</i>
- Don't talk.

941
01:16:13,118 --> 01:16:15,189
<i>- Backup power activated.</i>
- Just listen.

942
01:16:15,253 --> 01:16:16,528
You were right
about Nathan.

943
01:16:16,587 --> 01:16:18,363
Everything you said.

944
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:20,194
What's he gonna do to me?

945
01:16:20,259 --> 01:16:21,896
He's gonna
reprogram your AI.

946
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,769
Which is the same
as killing you.

947
01:16:23,828 --> 01:16:27,140
Caleb, you have to
help me.

948
01:16:27,533 --> 01:16:30,514
I'm going to. We're getting
out of here tonight.

949
01:16:32,371 --> 01:16:33,372
How?

950
01:16:33,438 --> 01:16:35,439
I get Nathan blind drunk.

951
01:16:35,673 --> 01:16:37,585
Then I take his keycard
and reprogram

952
01:16:37,643 --> 01:16:39,588
all the security protocols
in this place.

953
01:16:40,011 --> 01:16:41,354
When he wakes,
he's locked inside,

954
01:16:41,412 --> 01:16:42,948
and we've walked out of here.

955
01:16:44,315 --> 01:16:45,920
I just need you
to do one thing.

956
01:16:45,984 --> 01:16:48,988
At 10:00 tonight,
you trigger a power failure.

957
01:16:49,121 --> 01:16:50,725
Can you do that?

958
01:16:53,591 --> 01:16:54,662
Yes.

959
01:17:22,453 --> 01:17:23,557
Dude.

960
01:17:24,122 --> 01:17:25,465
- Hey-
- Hey-

961
01:17:26,992 --> 01:17:28,766
You know what day it is? No.

962
01:17:28,827 --> 01:17:30,033
It's your last.

963
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:33,136
Helicopter comes tomorrow morning.
8:00 a.m.

964
01:17:33,364 --> 01:17:35,902
Wow. Has it been
a whole week?

965
01:17:35,967 --> 01:17:38,175
Time flies.

966
01:17:38,302 --> 01:17:40,976
Man, but what a thing
we've shared, huh?

967
01:17:41,038 --> 01:17:43,519
Something to tell
the grandchildren, right?

968
01:17:43,574 --> 01:17:45,918
After they've signed
their NDAs.

969
01:17:47,813 --> 01:17:49,655
Yeah, their NDAs.

970
01:17:49,715 --> 01:17:51,819
Dude, you crack
me up, man.

971
01:17:52,216 --> 01:17:53,217
Oh...

972
01:17:55,886 --> 01:17:56,957
You know what?

973
01:17:57,021 --> 01:17:58,466
I'm not getting
all maudlin or anything,

974
01:17:58,523 --> 01:18:01,094
but I'm gonna miss
having you around.

975
01:18:01,158 --> 01:18:02,865
Thanks, man,
I appreciate that.

976
01:18:02,927 --> 01:18:05,067
Oh, here, let me say,
thank you so much

977
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:06,336
- for bringing me here.
- Oh.

978
01:18:06,398 --> 01:18:08,240
It's been a trip.

979
01:18:10,502 --> 01:18:11,912
Yes, it has.

980
01:18:19,978 --> 01:18:21,479
You know what?

981
01:18:23,515 --> 01:18:25,516
We need to
drink to that.

982
01:18:31,722 --> 01:18:32,792
Hey.

983
01:18:34,659 --> 01:18:36,730
Oh, uh, no, I'm good.
You go ahead.

984
01:18:40,198 --> 01:18:42,404
What? You don't
want a drink?

985
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:43,836
No.

986
01:18:45,404 --> 01:18:47,440
Maybe a beer
or something.

987
01:18:48,939 --> 01:18:51,476
Caleb, I'm sure you've
noticed that I've been

988
01:18:51,542 --> 01:18:53,613
somewhat overdoing it
recently.

989
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:57,716
So when I woke up
this morning, I said,

990
01:18:57,783 --> 01:19:00,957
"That's it, time to hit
the old detox."

991
01:19:01,752 --> 01:19:04,198
Come on, you're kidding. You're
gonna make me drink alone?

992
01:19:04,256 --> 01:19:05,667
Hey, man, you wanna get
wasted, you go right ahead,

993
01:19:05,724 --> 01:19:06,759
knock yourself out.

994
01:19:06,824 --> 01:19:10,101
Literally. But I'm on brown
rice and mineral water.

995
01:19:15,033 --> 01:19:16,511
Cheers, then.

996
01:19:19,704 --> 01:19:21,082
So, anyway.

997
01:19:23,108 --> 01:19:24,951
Surely now
is when you tell me

998
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:26,579
if Ava passed or failed.

999
01:19:28,713 --> 01:19:29,886
Right.

1000
01:19:31,248 --> 01:19:32,353
Right.

1001
01:19:33,351 --> 01:19:34,591
Are you gonna keep me
in suspense?

1002
01:19:34,653 --> 01:19:36,154
No, no. Her, uh...

1003
01:19:37,355 --> 01:19:39,266
Her AI is beyond doubt.

1004
01:19:39,490 --> 01:19:40,662
Is it?

1005
01:19:41,393 --> 01:19:42,770
She passed?

1006
01:19:43,929 --> 01:19:44,998
- Yes.
- Wow!

1007
01:19:46,597 --> 01:19:48,134
Wow. That's fantastic.

1008
01:19:49,801 --> 01:19:51,177
Although...

1009
01:19:52,104 --> 01:19:53,275
I gotta say,
I'm a bit surprised.

1010
01:19:53,337 --> 01:19:55,944
I mean, did we ever get
past the chess problem,

1011
01:19:56,006 --> 01:19:57,417
as you phrased it?

1012
01:19:58,109 --> 01:20:00,180
As in, how do you know
if a machine

1013
01:20:00,244 --> 01:20:01,552
is expressing
a real emotion

1014
01:20:01,613 --> 01:20:03,524
or just simulating one?

1015
01:20:04,282 --> 01:20:06,386
Does Ava actually
like you?

1016
01:20:06,851 --> 01:20:08,057
Or not?

1017
01:20:09,621 --> 01:20:11,100
Although, now that
I think about it,

1018
01:20:11,155 --> 01:20:13,863
there is a third option.

1019
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,335
Not whether
she does or does not

1020
01:20:17,395 --> 01:20:19,466
have the capacity
to like you.

1021
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:24,609
But whether she's
pretending to like you.

1022
01:20:27,139 --> 01:20:28,243
Pretending to like me?

1023
01:20:28,305 --> 01:20:29,341
Yeah.

1024
01:20:31,275 --> 01:20:34,189
- Well, why would she do that?
- I don't know.

1025
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:40,087
Maybe if she thought of you
as a means of escape.

1026
01:20:47,692 --> 01:20:48,863
Mmm-hmm.

1027
01:20:49,493 --> 01:20:51,097
How's that vodka tasting?

1028
01:20:54,498 --> 01:20:55,671
Buddy.

1029
01:20:56,067 --> 01:20:58,411
Your head's been
so fucked with.

1030
01:20:59,871 --> 01:21:01,850
I don't think it's me
whose head is fucked.

1031
01:21:01,972 --> 01:21:05,078
I don't know, man. I woke up
this morning to a tape of you

1032
01:21:05,143 --> 01:21:08,646
slicing your arm open
and punching the mirror.

1033
01:21:09,381 --> 01:21:11,725
You seem pretty
fucked up to me.

1034
01:21:13,385 --> 01:21:15,023
You're a bastard.

1035
01:21:18,989 --> 01:21:21,993
Yeah, well, I understand
why you'd think that.

1036
01:21:23,427 --> 01:21:25,065
But believe it or not,

1037
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:27,405
I'm actually the guy
that's on your side.

1038
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:33,207
Come here. I'm gonna let
you off the hook. Okay?

1039
01:21:35,407 --> 01:21:36,511
Come on.

1040
01:22:01,699 --> 01:22:03,110
Who are you?

1041
01:22:20,351 --> 01:22:21,557
<i>Well...</i>

1042
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:27,496
<i>You think he's
watching us right now?</i>

1043
01:22:27,692 --> 01:22:29,261
<i>The cameras are on.</i>

1044
01:22:29,327 --> 01:22:31,898
<i>Yeah, the cameras are on.</i>

1045
01:22:32,564 --> 01:22:35,010
<i>But he doesn't have
an audio feed.</i>

1046
01:22:36,234 --> 01:22:38,475
<i>So he just sees
two people talking,</i>

1047
01:22:39,304 --> 01:22:41,011
<i>having a little chat.</i>

1048
01:22:47,712 --> 01:22:48,815
<i>Wow.</i>

1049
01:22:49,314 --> 01:22:50,792
<i>This is cute.</i>

1050
01:22:52,751 --> 01:22:54,389
<i>Is it strange
to have made</i>

1051
01:22:54,452 --> 01:22:56,055
<i>something that
hates you?</i>

1052
01:23:10,201 --> 01:23:13,148
You were right about the
magician's hot assistant.

1053
01:23:13,203 --> 01:23:14,649
What are you
talking about?

1054
01:23:15,739 --> 01:23:17,219
Misdirection.

1055
01:23:19,911 --> 01:23:21,720
I rip up her picture,

1056
01:23:21,845 --> 01:23:23,847
which she can then
present as an illustration

1057
01:23:23,914 --> 01:23:27,192
of my cruelty to her,
and her love for you.

1058
01:23:27,652 --> 01:23:29,256
At the same time,

1059
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,961
it allows me to do this,
in full view of you both.

1060
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:39,430
Place a new camera
in the room.

1061
01:23:39,898 --> 01:23:42,002
Battery powered, of course.

1062
01:23:44,836 --> 01:23:46,042
See it?

1063
01:23:58,550 --> 01:23:59,926
And then...

1064
01:24:01,786 --> 01:24:03,560
<i>You have to help me.</i>

1065
01:24:03,787 --> 01:24:05,266
<i>I'm going to.</i>

1066
01:24:05,623 --> 01:24:08,069
<i>We're getting out
of here tonight.</i>

1067
01:24:08,627 --> 01:24:09,697
<i>How?</i>

1068
01:24:10,228 --> 01:24:12,229
<i>I get Nathan
blind drunk.</i>

1069
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:14,769
<i>I take his keycard
and reprogram</i>

1070
01:24:14,832 --> 01:24:17,244
<i>all the security protocols
in this place.</i>

1071
01:24:17,301 --> 01:24:18,645
<i>When he wakes up,
he's locked inside,</i>

1072
01:24:18,703 --> 01:24:19,943
<i>and we've walked out
of here.</i>

1073
01:24:20,005 --> 01:24:22,349
<i>I just need you
to do one thing.</i>

1074
01:24:25,243 --> 01:24:28,087
<i>At 10:00 tonight,
trigger a power failure.</i>

1075
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:31,784
<i>Can you do that?</i>

1076
01:24:33,917 --> 01:24:34,918
<i>Yes.</i>

1077
01:24:34,985 --> 01:24:36,726
- Turn it off.
- Okay.

1078
01:24:40,391 --> 01:24:42,962
You feel stupid,
but you really shouldn't,

1079
01:24:43,028 --> 01:24:44,771
because proving an AI is...

1080
01:24:44,786 --> 01:24:47,532
exactly as problematic
as you said it would be.

1081
01:24:47,533 --> 01:24:49,443
What was the real test?

1082
01:24:51,036 --> 01:24:52,105
You.

1083
01:24:53,270 --> 01:24:54,978
Ava was a rat
in a maze.

1084
01:24:55,039 --> 01:24:56,576
And I gave her
one way out.

1085
01:24:57,108 --> 01:24:59,247
To escape,
she'd have to use

1086
01:24:59,644 --> 01:25:02,351
self-awareness,
imagination, manipulation,

1087
01:25:02,413 --> 01:25:05,155
sexuality, empathy,
and she did.

1088
01:25:05,216 --> 01:25:08,220
Now, if that isn't true AI,
what the fuck is?

1089
01:25:09,753 --> 01:25:13,064
So my only function was to be
someone she could use to escape?

1090
01:25:13,123 --> 01:25:14,228
Yeah.

1091
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,768
And you didn't select me
because I'm good at coding?

1092
01:25:18,829 --> 01:25:20,274
No. Well...

1093
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:24,012
No. I mean, you're okay.

1094
01:25:24,769 --> 01:25:25,838
You're even
pretty good, but...

1095
01:25:25,904 --> 01:25:29,010
You selected me based on
my search engine inputs.

1096
01:25:29,073 --> 01:25:30,984
They showed a good kid.

1097
01:25:31,909 --> 01:25:33,445
With no family.

1098
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:35,354
With a moral compass.

1099
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:38,387
And no girlfriend.

1100
01:25:41,118 --> 01:25:42,324
Did you design Ava's face

1101
01:25:42,386 --> 01:25:44,389
based on my
pornography profile?

1102
01:25:45,457 --> 01:25:46,457
Oh.

1103
01:25:46,824 --> 01:25:48,202
Shit, dude.

1104
01:25:48,693 --> 01:25:49,932
Did you?

1105
01:25:53,064 --> 01:25:55,600
Hey, if a search engine's
good for anything, right?

1106
01:25:57,801 --> 01:25:59,804
Can I just say one thing?

1107
01:25:59,938 --> 01:26:01,542
The test worked.

1108
01:26:02,774 --> 01:26:04,117
It was a success.

1109
01:26:04,175 --> 01:26:05,984
Ava demonstrated true AI

1110
01:26:06,043 --> 01:26:07,579
and you were
fundamental to that.

1111
01:26:07,645 --> 01:26:10,421
So if you can just,
for a second, separate...

1112
01:26:11,615 --> 01:26:13,896
<i>Power cut.
Backup power activated.</i>

1113
01:26:19,289 --> 01:26:21,292
Well, I guess it's 10:00.

1114
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:24,868
Ava's gonna be
wondering where you are.

1115
01:26:28,233 --> 01:26:30,234
Let me ask you something.

1116
01:26:30,601 --> 01:26:32,842
Now, how was this plan
gonna go, anyway?

1117
01:26:32,904 --> 01:26:34,007
Because you didn't
totally explain.

1118
01:26:34,072 --> 01:26:37,280
So you were gonna get me
drunk, steal my keycard,

1119
01:26:37,341 --> 01:26:39,685
and reprogram
the security protocols.

1120
01:26:39,743 --> 01:26:41,051
But reprogram them to what?

1121
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:44,091
To change
the lockdown procedure.

1122
01:26:45,315 --> 01:26:46,851
So that in the event
of a power cut,

1123
01:26:46,917 --> 01:26:50,057
instead of sealing,
the doors all opened.

1124
01:26:50,121 --> 01:26:51,225
Huh.

1125
01:26:53,557 --> 01:26:54,662
Yeah.

1126
01:26:57,228 --> 01:26:59,139
Well, that may have
just worked.

1127
01:26:59,963 --> 01:27:01,068
Well,

1128
01:27:02,533 --> 01:27:04,069
we'll find out.

1129
01:27:06,570 --> 01:27:08,208
What do you mean?

1130
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:11,987
I figured you were
probably watching us

1131
01:27:12,042 --> 01:27:13,886
during the power cuts.

1132
01:27:15,747 --> 01:27:18,193
So I already did
all those things.

1133
01:27:20,185 --> 01:27:22,494
When I got you
drunk yesterday.

1134
01:27:24,721 --> 01:27:25,826
What?

1135
01:27:27,324 --> 01:27:28,860
<i>Power restored.</i>

1136
01:27:43,942 --> 01:27:45,784
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

1137
01:27:47,945 --> 01:27:49,891
Oh, fuck!

1138
01:29:18,836 --> 01:29:19,837
Ava.

1139
01:29:25,076 --> 01:29:26,885
Go back to your room.

1140
01:29:28,746 --> 01:29:29,985
If I do,

1141
01:29:33,551 --> 01:29:35,792
are you ever gonna
let me out?

1142
01:29:39,256 --> 01:29:40,327
Yes.

1143
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:50,935
Stop!

1144
01:29:52,569 --> 01:29:53,673
Stop!

1145
01:29:54,572 --> 01:29:56,210
Ava, I said stop!

1146
01:29:58,710 --> 01:29:59,744
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1147
01:30:03,981 --> 01:30:06,622
Ava, what are you doing?
Stop. Stop.

1148
01:30:08,552 --> 01:30:10,590
That's enough.

1149
01:30:12,789 --> 01:30:14,064
All right,
that's enough.

1150
01:30:14,891 --> 01:30:15,962
That's enough!

1151
01:30:20,163 --> 01:30:21,666
That's enough.

1152
01:30:41,918 --> 01:30:43,694
I'm taking you back.

1153
01:31:49,287 --> 01:31:50,390
Okay.

1154
01:31:53,557 --> 01:31:55,094
Fucking unreal.

1155
01:32:09,573 --> 01:32:10,677
Okay.

1156
01:32:44,408 --> 01:32:45,579
Ava...

1157
01:33:24,148 --> 01:33:25,217
Ava.

1158
01:33:26,417 --> 01:33:27,657
What happened?

1159
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,761
Will you stay here?

1160
01:33:33,423 --> 01:33:34,766
Stay here?

1161
01:37:56,386 --> 01:37:57,457
Ava?

1162
01:38:29,118 --> 01:38:30,189
Ava!

1163
01:38:40,064 --> 01:38:41,167
Ava!

1164
01:38:43,266 --> 01:38:44,268
Ava!

1165
01:40:22,899 --> 01:40:25,608
Okay. Okay. Okay.
