{30726}{30797}"with its meter, rhyme|and figures of speech.
{30798}{30845}"Then ask two questions.
{30846}{30901}"One: How artfully has the objective|of the poem been rendered ?
{30902}{30986}"And, two: How important|is that objective ?
{30988}{31034}"Question one rates|the poem's perfection.
{31036}{31085}"Question two rates|its importance.
{31086}{31145}"And once these questions|have been answered...
{31146}{31229}"determining a poem's greatness|becomes a relatively simple matter.
{31230}{31293}"If the poem's score|for perfection is plotted...
{31294}{31345}"on the horizontal|of a graph...
{31346}{31429}"and its importance|is plotted on the vertical,
{31430}{31509}"then calculating|the total area of the poem...
{31510}{31576}"yields the measure|of its greatness.
{31637}{31763}"A sonnet by Byron might|score high on the vertical,
{31765}{31835}"but only average|on the horizontal.
{31837}{31914}"A Shakespearean sonnet,|on the other hand,
{31916}{31997}"would score high both|horizontally and vertically,
{31998}{32045}"yielding|a massive total area;
{32046}{32126}"thereby revealing|the poem to be truly great.
{32128}{32243}"As you proceed through the poetry in|this book, practice this rating method.
{32245}{32310}"As your ability to evaluate|poems in this manner grows,
{32312}{32451}so will-- so will your enjoyment|and understanding of poetry."
{32557}{32604}Excrement.
{32661}{32718}That's what I think|of Mr. J. Evans Pritchard.
{32720}{32796}We're not laying pipe.|We're talking about poetry.
{32798}{32875}I mean, how can you describe poetry|like American Bandstand ?
{32877}{32994}"I like Byron. I give him a 42.|But I can't dance to it."
{32996}{33070}Now, I want you|to rip out that page.
{33072}{33154}Go on.|Rip out the entire page.

{35514}{35560}No ! We will not|have that here.
{35562}{35608}No more|of Mr. J. Evans Pritchard.
{35610}{35688}Now, my class, you will learn|to think for yourselves again.
{35690}{35774}You will learn|to savor words and language.
{35776}{35832}No matter what|anybody tells you,

{35926}{35982}I see that look|in Mr. Pitts' eye...

{36040}{36086}with going to business school|or medical school.
{36088}{36134}Right ? Maybe.
{36136}{36186}Mr. Hopkins, you may agree|with him, thinking,
{36188}{36266}"Yes, we should simply study|our Mr. Pritchard...
{36268}{36338}"and learn our rhyme and meter|and go quietly about the business...

{36416}{36486}I have a little secret for you.|Huddle up.
{36488}{36534}Huddle up !
{36724}{36806}We don't read and write|poetry because it's cute.
{36808}{36922}We read and write poetry because|we are members of the human race.
{36924}{37038}And the human race|is filled with passion.
{37040}{37102}Medicine, law,|business, engineering;
{37104}{37181}these are noble pursuits|and necessary to sustain life.
{37182}{37242}But poetry,
{37244}{37342}beauty, romance, love;
{37344}{37406}these are what|we stay alive for.
{37408}{37477}To quote from Whitman:
{37478}{37575}"O me, O life of the questions|of these recurring.
{37577}{37651}"Of the endless trains|of the faithless.
{37653}{37724}"Of cities filled|with the foolish.

{37902}{38001}"That life exists|and identity.
{38002}{38061}"That the powerful play|goes on,

{38174}{38238}"That the powerful play|goes on,

{39037}{39103}Quite an interesting class|you gave today, Mr. Keating.
{39105}{39175}-Sorry if I shocked you, Mr. McAllister.|-There's no need to apologize.
{39177}{39251}It was very fascinating,|misguided though it was.
{39253}{39299}You think so ?
{39301}{39379}You take a big risk by encouraging them|to become artists, John.
{39381}{39471}When they realize that they're|not Rembrandts, Shakespeares or Mozarts,
{39473}{39511}they'll hate you for it.
{39513}{39595}We're not talking artists, George.|We're talking freethinkers.
{39597}{39655}Freethinkers at 17 ?
{39657}{39704}Funny, I never pegged you|as a cynic.
{39761}{39826}Not a cynic.
{39828}{39875}A realist.
{39877}{39975}"Show me the heart unfettered|by foolish dreams,

{42381}{42516}The Dead Poets were dedicated|to sucking the marrow out of life.
{42518}{42596}That's a phrase from Thoreau we'd invoke|at the beginning of every meeting.
{42598}{42660}You see, we would gather|at the old lndian cave...
{42662}{42770}and take turns reading from Thoreau,|Whitman, Shelley; the biggies.
{42772}{42815}Even some of our own verse.
{42817}{42905}And in the enchantment of the moment,|we'd let poetry work its magic.
{42906}{42983}You mean it was a bunch of guys|sitting around, reading poetry ?
{42985}{43056}No, Mr. Overstreet.|It wasn't just guys.
{43058}{43136}We weren't a Greek organization.|We were romantics.
{43138}{43258}We didn't just read poetry, we let it|drip from our tongues, like honey.
{43260}{43372}Spirits soared, women swooned|and gods were created, gentlemen.
