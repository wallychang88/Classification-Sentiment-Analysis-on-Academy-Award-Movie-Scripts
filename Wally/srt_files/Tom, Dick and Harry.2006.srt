1
00:03:26,682 --> 00:03:31,949
Waghmare...
- Shame! Shame!

2
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:36,617
Shut down the police station

3
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:37,954
Shame on the policemen

4
00:03:38,027 --> 00:03:41,622
Sir, the crowd is growing

5
00:03:41,697 --> 00:03:43,961
Drive them away

6
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:47,628
Shut the doors.
- How can we shut the doors

7
00:03:47,703 --> 00:03:49,967
This is a police station.
- Yes, that's the big problem

8
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,633
Doors of a police station can't
be closed. What to do now?

9
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,802
They have a point, since you got
posted to this police station...

10
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:57,641
...there's been a spurt
in kidnappings.

11
00:03:57,713 --> 00:03:59,647
You mean, I have a hand in this?

12
00:03:59,715 --> 00:04:03,651
No sir, but the law is supposed to
know everything. Why don't you say...

13
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,653
who's behind the kidnappings?
- Your father

14
00:04:05,721 --> 00:04:07,985
What!
- No, my daddy perhaps. Look...

15
00:04:08,057 --> 00:04:12,653
it's a crisis and we got
to solve it. - Indeed

16
00:04:12,728 --> 00:04:16,664
But I've no clue about who's
behind these kidnappings

17
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:38,180
You're back?
- What are you Jassi, a wrestler?

18
00:04:38,254 --> 00:04:40,688
Every time I try to get close to
you, you give me a flooring

19
00:04:40,756 --> 00:04:43,691
You keep dreaming 24 hours of
how to finger your wife...

20
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,693
...I keep you floored

21
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:53,691
Then how about you on top
of me, that'd be fun

22
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:57,705
For thinking that you're a Dharmendra,
I'll show you, just you wait.

23
00:04:58,774 --> 00:05:01,709
What are you up to?
- Where's the broom?

24
00:05:01,777 --> 00:05:03,210
You won't find it

25
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:05,212
Why?
- I hid it

26
00:05:05,281 --> 00:05:07,715
Where's the stick?
- You won't find it

27
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,041
I hid it where you won't find it

28
00:05:15,057 --> 00:05:18,049
Will you force yourself upon me?
- I shall

29
00:05:18,127 --> 00:05:20,061
If you won't give in, then I will.

30
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:23,724
Strange, the ways of
a man with his wife

31
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:24,891
Let go of me

32
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:28,736
Jassi, give me a yoghurt shake

33
00:05:28,804 --> 00:05:31,739
Must you grab me whenever
and wherever...

34
00:05:31,807 --> 00:05:33,741
...you won't even let
me breathe in peace

35
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,740
Cool

36
00:05:36,078 --> 00:05:37,238
The maid

37
00:05:37,313 --> 00:05:39,747
Groping the maid, in front of you?

38
00:05:40,816 --> 00:05:44,081
But maybe, when you aren't around?
- Shut up

39
00:05:44,153 --> 00:05:47,748
Lady, I want my salary

40
00:05:48,824 --> 00:05:52,760
Of course, I'll give it to you,
why not, when do you want it?

41
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:56,093
Right now, or when you're leaving?

42
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:04,102
You settle with her later. First,
collect the rent from the twosome

43
00:06:04,173 --> 00:06:06,767
Okay, later.
- Pronto

44
00:06:10,946 --> 00:06:12,777
Say that

45
00:06:12,848 --> 00:06:14,110
How many...

46
00:06:14,183 --> 00:06:15,275
men...

47
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:17,785
there were? Mind-blowing!
How many men were there

48
00:06:17,953 --> 00:06:19,784
More?

49
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:21,789
Turban... beard... downstairs...

50
00:06:21,957 --> 00:06:25,120
you mean the uncle downstairs,
yes, we call him chief

51
00:06:25,861 --> 00:06:30,389
Two... men... were there. Chief,
there were two men Mind-blowing

52
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:31,797
Ahead?

53
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:33,801
What? Ok!

54
00:06:36,138 --> 00:06:37,799
Yes, say that

55
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:41,807
What happened? Is it tough?

56
00:06:42,878 --> 00:06:44,812
Give me something, man

57
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:49,815
Beast... dog... cat... buffalo...
elephant... cow?

58
00:06:49,885 --> 00:06:51,819
Pig, hippopotamus, giraffe
? Which beast is it?

59
00:06:51,887 --> 00:06:53,821
Shut up, just shut up?

60
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,825
Forget it; now start again?

61
00:06:58,894 --> 00:07:01,988
Piss? After 3 months of trying
to watch this flick...

62
00:07:02,064 --> 00:07:04,828
you want to go pissing now?
No, it's something else?

63
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:10,002
Chop it off? And afterwards,
piss? What... no?

64
00:07:10,072 --> 00:07:13,838
Pissing, chopping, any connection?

65
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,844
Right, no connection

66
00:07:16,912 --> 00:07:18,345
But explain it properly

67
00:07:18,414 --> 00:07:19,847
Forget it, start again

68
00:07:21,183 --> 00:07:23,845
Piss... chop that?

69
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,853
Pi and ss

70
00:07:26,188 --> 00:07:27,849
Forget the rest

71
00:07:27,923 --> 00:07:29,185
Take pi

72
00:07:29,258 --> 00:07:30,850
Pi... then?

73
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:35,861
Lady, yes

74
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:37,362
And marry?

75
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:40,368
Couple... husband-wife,
wife-husband?

76
00:07:40,436 --> 00:07:43,872
At the wedding? Bride
and groom... groom?

77
00:07:44,373 --> 00:07:45,863
Groom it is

78
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:51,202
Groom? No, the previous, Pi?

79
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,378
Pi and groom

80
00:08:00,956 --> 00:08:02,218
Pig!

81
00:08:03,058 --> 00:08:04,389
Son

82
00:08:05,227 --> 00:08:07,889
Son of a pig. Mind-blowing!

83
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,891
What's next?

84
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,904
Sons of pigs, there
were only 2 of them...

85
00:08:16,972 --> 00:08:21,909
...and you were a threesome,
still you ran

86
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:25,913
You are a twosome

87
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:29,917
Some twosome you are,
but I don't run...

88
00:08:29,985 --> 00:08:31,919
...I collect the rent,
then I go, get it?

89
00:08:31,987 --> 00:08:33,921
I didn't get a word,
what did he say?

90
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:40,928
House... money... 3000,
rent? I'll handle this

91
00:08:41,997 --> 00:08:46,934
Uncle Happy... happy in name
but you're never happy

92
00:08:47,002 --> 00:08:49,095
But no one will pay 3000
for this house...

93
00:08:49,171 --> 00:08:50,934
...tell him, but you can't, can you?

94
00:08:51,006 --> 00:08:53,270
1500, at the most.
- Mind your end of the business

95
00:08:53,342 --> 00:08:59,941
Look at the water seepage up there.
- You expected whisky for 3000?

96
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:01,939
Hey, he said what?

97
00:09:03,285 --> 00:09:05,276
And look at that view

98
00:09:05,354 --> 00:09:08,949
Open the window and take in that
old man, coughing forever

99
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,291
Stop talking nonsense

100
00:09:13,362 --> 00:09:15,125
Watching him makes me imagine,
how quickly I might be dead

101
00:09:15,197 --> 00:09:18,291
I don't want to hear anything,
I want my rent, 3000, all of it

102
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:20,961
If you can't pay, clear out. I'll
find any number of tenants

103
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,960
I don't run a charity

104
00:09:23,038 --> 00:09:24,562
What?

105
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,973
Pay me in cash, not sign language

106
00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:29,474
How much is it?

107
00:09:29,545 --> 00:09:30,978
500... thrice?

108
00:09:31,046 --> 00:09:33,981
Only fifteen hundred? Where's
the other 1500?

109
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:41,990
Happy uncle, instead of
your 1500, a new box

110
00:09:42,057 --> 00:09:43,490
Another box?

111
00:09:44,326 --> 00:09:47,989
You'll enjoy, strawberry flavor

112
00:09:48,063 --> 00:09:51,999
As if it's a box of strawberry
ice cream that you're giving me

113
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:55,332
I don't want condoms. Better
explain to him, you mutt...

114
00:09:55,404 --> 00:09:58,999
I don't want boxes,
I want cash, 3000

115
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:03,340
Box... doesn't want... cash?

116
00:10:03,412 --> 00:10:05,004
Shame on you, Happy uncle

117
00:10:07,082 --> 00:10:09,016
Men without wives appreciate
it's importance...

118
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:15,022
the significance of which is lost
on married men of your ilk

119
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:17,022
You know,

120
00:10:17,092 --> 00:10:21,028
we've no cash and badly off, so,
please make use of this

121
00:10:21,096 --> 00:10:23,189
I'm tired of the use of it,

122
00:10:23,265 --> 00:10:27,031
a kilo and a half, if I lose a month,
how long can I keep up the use?

123
00:10:27,102 --> 00:10:28,535
Next month, I want
full rent, get it?

124
00:10:28,604 --> 00:10:31,038
I swear on your mother,
next month...

125
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:33,199
we'll pay the full amount. - Don't
involve my mother, next month...

126
00:10:33,275 --> 00:10:36,369
I want full rent, get it?
- It's just a little problem

127
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:40,541
Next month, we'll pay 3000. - Only
you have problems and I haven't?

128
00:10:40,616 --> 00:10:43,050
Next month, full rent!
- Please try to understand...

129
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:44,380
What's it man?

130
00:10:44,453 --> 00:10:48,048
Damn... he... he's saying
the same thing?

131
00:10:49,124 --> 00:10:51,217
He's saying the same thing? You're
saying the same thing?

132
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:54,387
Same thing, all along, what else?
- Sorry uncle

133
00:10:54,463 --> 00:10:58,058
Deaf mute morons, for months...
- Yes next month, for sure

134
00:10:58,233 --> 00:11:00,064
Why didn't you tell that before?

135
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:05,062
Sure, even if you said,
how would I hear?

136
00:11:06,141 --> 00:11:09,235
Good God! Another box?
- What to do?

137
00:11:09,311 --> 00:11:12,075
Just take a look...

138
00:11:12,147 --> 00:11:15,583
there's more in here than
the company stocks

139
00:11:15,651 --> 00:11:18,245
What am I to do with it all? Make
Christmas gifts to neighbors?

140
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,582
What's it Mummy?

141
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:21,088
Shut up and get back
to your homework

142
00:11:22,157 --> 00:11:28,096
Why give to neighbors, I'm still
here, I'll use up all of it

143
00:11:28,597 --> 00:11:38,097
By God Jassi, if you're with me,
we'll create a world record in a week

144
00:11:38,173 --> 00:11:41,108
Shut up, you're useless.
I've had enough of you

145
00:11:41,176 --> 00:11:45,112
Now I'll call Dipak.
- Don't you dare! I'll slap you

146
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:50,117
You married me, now you want
Dipak? - Control your brain

147
00:11:50,185 --> 00:11:55,122
Dipak will be the new paying guest,
he'll move in with the twosome

148
00:11:55,190 --> 00:12:00,127
And he'll pay half the rent.
- Really? But who is this Dipak?

149
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:22,147
Now get off, quick

150
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:25,311
Move

151
00:12:25,387 --> 00:12:26,649
Are you blind, can't you see?

152
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:31,159
Forgive me, an impulse from behind
propelled me forward to you

153
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:35,162
Have I hurt you somewhere?

154
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,492
Not your hands upon me

155
00:12:36,565 --> 00:12:38,157
Not that I can get anything
else up on you

156
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:41,168
What!
- My mistake

157
00:12:41,236 --> 00:12:43,170
Let's embrace and I'll say sorry

158
00:12:43,672 --> 00:12:45,162
Insolent idiot

159
00:12:45,507 --> 00:12:49,170
She's gone? She too is gone,
I can't impress girls

160
00:12:52,347 --> 00:12:54,508
It's a man.
- What are you up to, mister?

161
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:58,679
That's a cultured voice. Can you
tell me where Jassi Villa is?

162
00:12:58,754 --> 00:13:02,190
Two hundred feet.

163
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:09,196
Mister, two hundred feet
in this direction

164
00:13:09,264 --> 00:13:11,198
Thanks.
- Strange sort

165
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:14,201
Two... three... four... five

166
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:17,204
Forty, forty one, forty
two, forty three

167
00:13:17,272 --> 00:13:18,705
44... 45...

168
00:13:21,276 --> 00:13:23,210
47... 48...

169
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:34,216
My bag... which count was
I on? I've slipped up

170
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:38,225
So this way... most likely... yes

171
00:13:38,293 --> 00:13:41,558
60, 61, 62, 63, 64

172
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,724
65, 66, 67

173
00:13:49,304 --> 00:13:50,737
Get up

174
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:55,240
Hello

175
00:13:55,911 --> 00:13:59,244
Mister... hey mister...

176
00:14:01,316 --> 00:14:02,749
Sorry, it's a watchman

177
00:14:08,924 --> 00:14:17,263
Mirror-mirror on the wall, who's
the bad-man of all?

178
00:14:17,332 --> 00:14:21,268
Soprano, you are the one

179
00:14:35,951 --> 00:14:40,615
Soprano, to end up like you,
a villain, vile yet able,

180
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:45,285
from which institute can I procure
a certificate to begin with

181
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:52,289
No institute rears the great
villain, it happens to be a god-gift

182
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,305
One must possess the
matrix of the mind,

183
00:14:59,808 --> 00:15:05,303
greed, destruction, betrayal...

184
00:15:05,914 --> 00:15:09,645
...hunger for power are elements
that must be innate,

185
00:15:09,718 --> 00:15:13,313
in one crazy DNA.

186
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:18,325
But to stay in power there are rules

187
00:15:19,394 --> 00:15:24,331
To become a great villain,
you have to follow rules

188
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,323
Rule number One,

189
00:15:28,403 --> 00:15:33,340
unlike Mogambo, be not happy
at every turn of phrase

190
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:36,343
Rule number Two, be not Shakal,

191
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:39,346
do not merely caress
your bald pate...

192
00:15:39,414 --> 00:15:43,350
...use also the brain
that lies beneath

193
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:46,512
Rule number Three, like Gabbar...

194
00:15:46,588 --> 00:15:50,684
...never go jaywalking in
jungles chewing tobacco

195
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:53,353
Tobacco kills

196
00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:00,367
I keep these three great villains...

197
00:16:02,037 --> 00:16:06,371
...so I may learn from their mistakes

198
00:16:08,443 --> 00:16:13,380
The villain of today ought
to be international

199
00:16:13,548 --> 00:16:17,382
It is the time for globalization

200
00:16:17,452 --> 00:16:22,389
The villain should rake it
in dollars, pounds, euros

201
00:16:22,457 --> 00:16:27,394
Soprano, I too wish to become
a bad-man, just like you

202
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:34,391
Idiot, unlike Ram Gopal Varma, I
don't run a talent-launching factory

203
00:16:38,473 --> 00:16:40,407
What message from the mafia?

204
00:16:41,076 --> 00:16:45,410
Soprano, the mafia says
that ever since...

205
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,417
Sushmita Sen, Priyanka Chopra and
Aishwarya Rai turned into...

206
00:16:50,485 --> 00:16:56,424
the misses of worlds and universes,
the overseas demand has increased...

207
00:16:56,491 --> 00:16:59,426
for Indian girls. Therefore...

208
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:01,428
our overseas distributor...

209
00:17:01,496 --> 00:17:06,433
...Mr. Andy Lulla wishes for
50 more Indian beauties

210
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:11,438
To which end, he has sent an
advance cheque of 100 million

211
00:17:11,506 --> 00:17:17,775
Remember one thing Soprano, you are
dealing with international mafia

212
00:17:17,846 --> 00:17:20,440
Time is money for us

213
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,941
Up on the wall,

214
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:31,448
are portraits for you to see. But
you see, I wish to exceed them all

215
00:17:33,528 --> 00:17:37,055
I'm the greatest terror,
biggest villain...

216
00:17:37,132 --> 00:17:40,465
...the highest-hailed
bad-man of India

217
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:44,461
So bad that history books
of the future...

218
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:48,475
...will teach the kids
a chapter upon me,

219
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:52,479
so they never turn bad like me.

220
00:17:52,547 --> 00:17:57,484
Nothing is impossible for Soprano

221
00:17:59,554 --> 00:18:06,483
Now presenting before you a parade
of a sampling of Indian beauties

222
00:18:08,563 --> 00:18:09,655
May I?

223
00:18:09,731 --> 00:18:11,494
Oh, it's open?

224
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:14,000
Excuse me,

225
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:17,505
that watchman is lying out there
bashed out of his senses

226
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:23,505
I generally do not hurt people, but
he accosted me, so I did him in

227
00:18:24,012 --> 00:18:28,506
Maybe I've been training too hard,
but if you may please...

228
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:32,849
can you please direct
me to this address?

229
00:18:32,921 --> 00:18:34,513
I'm American

230
00:18:36,024 --> 00:18:38,515
So that's why you don't talk much

231
00:18:40,028 --> 00:18:42,121
Excuse me, surely someone around
here is made-in-India?

232
00:18:42,197 --> 00:18:45,530
Soprano, could he be
a police stooge?

233
00:18:48,036 --> 00:18:49,526
Will someone say something?

234
00:18:51,706 --> 00:18:54,539
Have I wandered into a graveyard

235
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:59,706
Who are you?
- Oh made-in-India! I'm blind

236
00:18:59,781 --> 00:19:03,547
And I have lost my way, please,
direct me to this address

237
00:19:03,618 --> 00:19:09,557
What proof of your blindness?
- You ask a blind man his witness?

238
00:19:20,235 --> 00:19:22,567
Come, I'll lead you.

239
00:19:22,637 --> 00:19:24,571
You know where I'm headed?
- Yes

240
00:19:26,074 --> 00:19:28,565
In the name of whoever your
god be, I greet you

241
00:19:28,643 --> 00:19:34,081
None whom you choose? - Mr.
Doorman, you may choose to differ,

242
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:35,582
so I greet you in the
name of all gods...

243
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,083
...you are free to choose
what you like

244
00:19:37,152 --> 00:19:39,586
Do I look like a doorman to you?

245
00:19:39,654 --> 00:19:41,918
Goodness, are you the landlord?

246
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:45,585
Right choice, I'm he, who are you?

247
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,922
I'm Dipak

248
00:19:46,995 --> 00:19:49,088
Oh, so you're Dipak, you are?

249
00:19:49,164 --> 00:19:51,098
Yes.
- Welcome

250
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,600
Jassi, look Dipak is here

251
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:56,601
I like to be paid on time, remember

252
00:19:57,672 --> 00:20:01,608
Welcome, sit

253
00:20:04,212 --> 00:20:07,613
Not that kind, I meant rent-on-time

254
00:20:07,682 --> 00:20:09,206
Hi Dipak, so you came?
- Hi, is that Jassi?

255
00:20:09,284 --> 00:20:10,615
Yes, any problem finding
this place?

256
00:20:10,685 --> 00:20:14,621
Not at all, I just followed my nose

257
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,626
Namaste.
- Sat Sri Akal, sit

258
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:21,625
I've told him to pay rent on time

259
00:20:22,697 --> 00:20:24,631
Not on my wife's lap

260
00:20:24,699 --> 00:20:27,634
Jassi, what's he to be, a
tenant or an adopted son?

261
00:20:28,703 --> 00:20:33,640
Fool! You can't tell between
a sofa and my wife's lap?

262
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:37,974
You speak of sofa and wife? I make
no difference between you and Jassi

263
00:20:38,046 --> 00:20:40,640
What are you saying?
- Well...

264
00:20:40,815 --> 00:20:41,975
I'm blind

265
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,142
What!

266
00:20:43,218 --> 00:20:46,654
I'm here in Mumbai for
medical treatment

267
00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:48,154
Damn

268
00:20:49,824 --> 00:20:53,988
Oh serendipity! I'm
given my third ape

269
00:20:54,996 --> 00:20:59,660
Come on, I'll show you
to your room-mates

270
00:20:59,734 --> 00:21:01,668
Are you so delighted?
- I'll show you

271
00:21:02,737 --> 00:21:04,671
100 babies less

272
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,671
200 babies less

273
00:21:07,742 --> 00:21:09,676
300 babies less

274
00:21:09,844 --> 00:21:11,675
What... what's up?

275
00:21:13,748 --> 00:21:17,684
Piss? Hurry up, we've lots to do

276
00:21:18,753 --> 00:21:21,688
Don't forget to flush afterwards

277
00:21:21,756 --> 00:21:26,693
Bloody shirker, goes pissing
whenever there's work to be done

278
00:21:29,197 --> 00:21:31,688
That's your bed, park your luggage

279
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:36,202
Be comfortable, tell me if
there's anything you want

280
00:21:36,271 --> 00:21:38,705
Happy uncle, how's life?
- Perfectly all right

281
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:40,707
Who's this stylish guy?
- New tenant

282
00:21:40,775 --> 00:21:43,710
Kin?
- My new tenant

283
00:21:43,778 --> 00:21:48,715
A relative, is he a brother-in-law?
- New tenant, he's putting up here

284
00:21:48,783 --> 00:21:53,720
Nice, but supping up here? With
us? But we normally eat out

285
00:21:53,788 --> 00:21:55,722
Who's he?
- He's stone deaf

286
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,884
He got stoned? Where?
- Nowhere. His ears went on strike

287
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,724
This duffer is deaf.
- Poor guy, hearing-impaired?

288
00:22:01,796 --> 00:22:03,730
What did you say?

289
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:06,733
Whom is he addressing?
- Say that again, I can read lips

290
00:22:06,801 --> 00:22:11,738
Uncle, what did he say?
- Explain this, my new tenant

291
00:22:11,806 --> 00:22:15,742
Look brother, I am the new tenant

292
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,745
Oh... tenant

293
00:22:18,813 --> 00:22:23,750
Uncle, this is no good.
- And what you give me is good?

294
00:22:23,818 --> 00:22:29,757
1500 in cash and the rest in
second-hand, used condoms?

295
00:22:29,824 --> 00:22:32,759
He's staying, you tell
him that. Excuse me

296
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:37,764
Look brother, I am staying

297
00:22:37,832 --> 00:22:39,766
Shut up... now talk

298
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:44,771
I'm talking, look at me...
- Shut up

299
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:49,105
Yes talk.
- I'm talking, what's your problem?

300
00:22:49,177 --> 00:22:50,269
Yes, tell me

301
00:22:53,848 --> 00:22:56,282
Oh... he stays here?

302
00:22:56,851 --> 00:23:00,787
Some madcap! I'm saying so and
then you clamp your hands on my mouth

303
00:23:00,855 --> 00:23:02,789
He says what?
- And then you expect me to speak?

304
00:23:02,857 --> 00:23:06,793
He... said to me... madcap?
Called me a madcap? Damn...

305
00:23:07,862 --> 00:23:09,796
you call me mad, you swine

306
00:23:09,864 --> 00:23:12,799
Let go of my neck, listen...
- You, your uncle Happy, you're mad

307
00:23:12,867 --> 00:23:15,802
Are you stoned or what? - Wears
sunglasses indoors and I'm mad

308
00:23:16,137 --> 00:23:19,800
Will you kill me, or what?
I'm sending you to an asylum

309
00:23:19,874 --> 00:23:21,307
You cur

310
00:23:21,376 --> 00:23:23,810
Let go... help!
- Come on

311
00:23:23,878 --> 00:23:27,814
A four-armed Satan!
- Step down, you coward

312
00:23:27,882 --> 00:23:32,819
God! Am I among ghosts?

313
00:23:32,887 --> 00:23:34,320
Help me! Hey Happy Singh!

314
00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:37,825
He's scared of me.
- I don't get scared

315
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,320
Happy Singh,

316
00:23:40,395 --> 00:23:42,158
please, let me go

317
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,822
What happened?

318
00:23:43,998 --> 00:23:45,829
Damn?

319
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,162
He?

320
00:23:47,235 --> 00:23:48,327
Is blind?

321
00:23:48,403 --> 00:23:49,836
He is blind?

322
00:23:50,004 --> 00:23:51,335
You are blind?

323
00:23:51,406 --> 00:23:52,839
You made me out rather soon

324
00:23:53,007 --> 00:23:57,842
Why didn't you say so before?
- I've been trying to, forever

325
00:23:58,346 --> 00:24:01,838
Yes, you want to meet him? Oh yes,
come on, meet my friend

326
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:04,851
So there's another? Is he dumb?
- Come on

327
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:09,185
He's dumb. He's Harry the mutt.
I'm Tom deaf and who are you?

328
00:24:09,257 --> 00:24:12,351
Hello, hello, I'm Dipak and I'm
blind. - What a dick! He makes up for

329
00:24:12,427 --> 00:24:15,863
the Dick who was missing
from Tom-Dick-n-Harry

330
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,023
Mind-blowing, nice to meet you.
- You too, you too, hello

331
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:21,193
Dick's okay, but a little respect
would make it sound fine.

332
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:23,032
Now I know why Happy
called me an ape...

333
00:24:23,104 --> 00:24:26,870
...one of the 3 apes who
won't see, talk or hear

334
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:29,202
Don't sit!
- What happened?

335
00:24:29,277 --> 00:24:32,041
Our... you know...
- What?

336
00:24:32,113 --> 00:24:33,876
You'll ruin our balloons

337
00:24:33,948 --> 00:24:37,884
We run an business in balloons,
international, exporting

338
00:24:37,952 --> 00:24:40,216
A business in balloons?

339
00:24:42,223 --> 00:24:44,885
I see, marketing balloons

340
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:26,933
You're my life, my love,

341
00:25:32,273 --> 00:25:34,935
my universe,

342
00:25:40,014 --> 00:25:42,949
You're my life, my love,

343
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,955
my universe,

344
00:25:51,025 --> 00:25:54,961
my days, nights, arise from you,

345
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:57,964
all conversations culminate in you

346
00:26:11,145 --> 00:26:13,978
You're my lone companion,

347
00:26:19,053 --> 00:26:21,988
you're my life, my love

348
00:26:47,081 --> 00:26:51,017
Like an all-encompassing carnival...

349
00:26:51,085 --> 00:26:54,020
...of all my dreams, fancies,
memories...

350
00:26:55,089 --> 00:27:02,018
you completely eclipse my life

351
00:27:03,097 --> 00:27:09,036
In your being, I still revel
in the emotions of my youth

352
00:27:10,371 --> 00:27:17,038
Only in conjunction with you,
climaxes the story of my existence

353
00:27:29,123 --> 00:27:31,057
You're my life, my love,

354
00:27:34,395 --> 00:27:37,057
my universe,

355
00:27:39,233 --> 00:27:43,067
my days, nights, arise from you,

356
00:27:43,137 --> 00:27:47,073
all conversations culminate in you

357
00:27:58,152 --> 00:27:59,585
Hey move!
- Who are you? Leave me!

358
00:27:59,654 --> 00:28:03,090
Hey, who are you? Acting smart!
Leave the girl! - Let go!

359
00:28:03,157 --> 00:28:10,086
Inspector Vajpayee, you have saved
countless girls from being raped,

360
00:28:10,598 --> 00:28:13,089
you exposed countless
sex scandals...

361
00:28:14,168 --> 00:28:17,103
...so you were the best
man for the case

362
00:28:17,171 --> 00:28:21,267
But it's amazing, that girls
are still being kidnapped...

363
00:28:21,342 --> 00:28:24,106
...and you've not a clue

364
00:28:24,178 --> 00:28:30,117
Sir, have no worries, soon
I'll expose this racket

365
00:28:30,184 --> 00:28:36,123
Let me mount this sting operation and
all of India will be left watching

366
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:39,284
I've posted my most
responsible officer...

367
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,126
...as an undercover on this operation

368
00:28:51,205 --> 00:28:53,139
Who's it so early?

369
00:28:53,207 --> 00:28:54,640
Yes... coming.

370
00:28:59,647 --> 00:29:01,137
What've you brought so early?

371
00:29:01,215 --> 00:29:03,149
Nothing but pomfret

372
00:29:06,487 --> 00:29:10,150
Fresh stuff.
- My stuff is always fresh,

373
00:29:10,224 --> 00:29:12,158
would you like?

374
00:29:13,227 --> 00:29:16,162
If you give, why won't I take?

375
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,492
How dare you,

376
00:29:17,565 --> 00:29:19,157
you want me to scream
for your wife?

377
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:22,167
Why do you keep screaming
for my wife?

378
00:29:22,236 --> 00:29:25,171
To do or not to do, is up to you. Go
away, I don't want your pomfret

379
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,175
Then I'll go upstairs,
he'll say yes for sure.

380
00:29:29,243 --> 00:29:32,178
Even otherwise, I'd give it to him

381
00:29:34,515 --> 00:29:37,348
How naughty, she sells
it up there and then...

382
00:29:37,418 --> 00:29:39,181
...she threatens to
scream for my wife

383
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,181
I don't like your stuff

384
00:29:54,535 --> 00:29:56,196
What happened?

385
00:29:58,272 --> 00:30:01,207
Hello, this is Popatbhai

386
00:30:03,277 --> 00:30:05,211
Hi Popatbhai, what news?

387
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,214
Send over 12 dozens

388
00:30:11,285 --> 00:30:14,550
Sure, we'll send 12 dozens.
No problem

389
00:30:14,622 --> 00:30:17,216
Okay, I'm hanging up

390
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:24,220
All else fine, Popatbhai? How's
the family and everyone?

391
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:27,230
Hung up?

392
00:30:27,301 --> 00:30:29,235
He hung up?

393
00:30:29,303 --> 00:30:32,238
Strange guy, disconnects without
saying and you don't say either, why?

394
00:30:34,308 --> 00:30:37,243
Sure, even if you said, how
would I hear? Smart boy

395
00:31:01,335 --> 00:31:02,768
Where is he?

396
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,605
I don't get a word
of your crossword...

397
00:31:09,677 --> 00:31:13,272
...and your friend won't
understand my heart

398
00:31:13,347 --> 00:31:16,282
So let's let it be, cute boy

399
00:31:17,351 --> 00:31:20,286
Who's this golden girl?

400
00:31:22,623 --> 00:31:24,284
Reading?

401
00:31:28,629 --> 00:31:30,290
I don't want any today

402
00:31:30,464 --> 00:31:32,295
Damn you

403
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:34,297
My love,

404
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:36,296
listen,

405
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,634
I have for you,

406
00:31:38,706 --> 00:31:42,301
absolutely fresh pomfret

407
00:31:42,376 --> 00:31:44,469
Once you get a taste of it,

408
00:31:44,545 --> 00:31:50,313
you'll come asking again and again,
give-me-more, give-me-more

409
00:31:50,384 --> 00:31:51,817
You want?

410
00:31:54,655 --> 00:31:56,316
You're telling me?

411
00:31:56,657 --> 00:32:00,320
Wait till I tell you what

412
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:06,332
Curse your mother, some
day I'll feed you my fish

413
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:14,330
Smell of pomfret

414
00:32:14,408 --> 00:32:16,342
Has the fisherwoman come?

415
00:32:16,677 --> 00:32:21,842
Hello, is anyone home? Is anyone
telling me anything?

416
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:26,353
No one's telling anything,
one's deaf, other's a mute

417
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:30,350
I'm stuck with cripples,
oh forget it

418
00:32:32,693 --> 00:32:39,360
Uncle... Tom uncle, Harry uncle,
where are you? Come out, quick

419
00:32:39,433 --> 00:32:43,369
Let me bathe in peace, as it is, it
takes me twice the time. Who is it?

420
00:32:43,437 --> 00:32:45,371
I'm Happy Singh's son.
- Hello son

421
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:49,705
Where are Tom uncle, Harry uncle?
- Uncle, today's my birthday

422
00:32:49,777 --> 00:32:52,371
Really boy, you've become a big boy

423
00:32:52,446 --> 00:32:53,879
Happy birthday, boy.
- Thank you, uncle

424
00:32:53,948 --> 00:32:55,381
Make sure you come to
the party tonight

425
00:32:55,449 --> 00:32:59,385
How can I refuse your invitation,
I'll come for sure

426
00:32:59,553 --> 00:33:05,389
Lands in a fix, what
do I give the boy?

427
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:09,395
Think boy, think... idea

428
00:33:25,746 --> 00:33:28,408
The party's happening right here

429
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:32,408
Bye Happy Singh, wonderful
party, was great fun!

430
00:33:35,489 --> 00:33:37,423
Hey Dipak?
- Is that you Mr. Singh?

431
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:40,426
What are you doing here, with
whatever's in your hands?

432
00:33:40,494 --> 00:33:45,932
Balloons, for the kids. What
better a gift for the kids?

433
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,767
Come on kids, quick, Dick uncle
has colored balloons for you

434
00:33:50,838 --> 00:33:52,430
He doesn't realize...

435
00:33:53,507 --> 00:34:01,437
Come on kids, it's all for you.
- What's he doing?

436
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,952
God, your mysteries are unending

437
00:34:14,795 --> 00:34:16,456
Son, it's useless now

438
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,464
The government gives
it away for free...

439
00:34:18,532 --> 00:34:19,794
...go and pick up as many as you wish

440
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:20,959
Okay sir

441
00:34:21,635 --> 00:34:22,966
Happy kids?

442
00:34:23,037 --> 00:34:25,631
Happy, what's this!
- Don't even talk about it, Jassi

443
00:34:25,706 --> 00:34:30,473
This is so embarrassing,
he blew them all up

444
00:34:30,544 --> 00:34:32,478
It's the wrong use of it

445
00:34:33,547 --> 00:34:37,483
Come here, have the lights gone
out of your head as well?

446
00:34:37,551 --> 00:34:41,487
Why are you angry Jassi, it's
for the kids to play with

447
00:34:41,555 --> 00:34:44,490
It's not for kids to play with,
it's for their daddies to play with

448
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:51,498
Only for daddies? What kind of
balloons Tom and Harry making?

449
00:34:54,568 --> 00:34:59,505
Put me in an embarrassing spot, how
am I concerned, balloons or condoms

450
00:34:59,573 --> 00:35:05,512
Duffer! You know what you did,
wasted 40 boxes of condoms

451
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:07,513
Guess how many births
they could've prevented

452
00:35:07,581 --> 00:35:11,677
Scoundrel, you've population on mind?
Because of your rotten condoms...

453
00:35:11,752 --> 00:35:15,518
do you know how much embarrassment
I had to face?

454
00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:17,682
Morons you don't know...

455
00:35:17,758 --> 00:35:22,525
how a balloon isn't a condom?
- Slowly, I can't make out

456
00:35:22,596 --> 00:35:25,531
Don't hit me, don't!
- What's he about, what?

457
00:35:26,867 --> 00:35:28,528
He'll hit back?

458
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:32,532
We can't afford the rent
and now, such a loss

459
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,702
Girl

460
00:35:37,778 --> 00:35:39,040
Forget him

461
00:35:40,614 --> 00:35:45,551
Hello, I am Dick.
- That's a cute name

462
00:35:47,154 --> 00:35:49,554
What say, how about making friends?

463
00:35:49,623 --> 00:35:53,559
Why not, I would love to

464
00:35:53,627 --> 00:35:57,563
I'm always open for new friends.
- Me too, me too

465
00:35:57,631 --> 00:36:02,568
You're such a sexy, strong,
handsome Dick

466
00:36:02,636 --> 00:36:04,069
This is going to be fun!

467
00:36:04,905 --> 00:36:07,567
Your soft arms,

468
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,572
soft cheeks

469
00:36:13,647 --> 00:36:16,582
I've softer parts.
- Show me

470
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,083
You want to see?

471
00:36:19,653 --> 00:36:21,086
So soft

472
00:36:24,658 --> 00:36:26,592
How soft

473
00:36:32,766 --> 00:36:34,927
What are you doing?
Don't use force!

474
00:36:35,002 --> 00:36:38,597
I'm not raping you, I'm making love

475
00:36:39,673 --> 00:36:41,607
If your wife sees, she'll kill me.

476
00:36:41,675 --> 00:36:44,610
Never killed a fly
and she's gone out

477
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:52,617
That brings out the horse in you?
Listen... don't stick like a leech

478
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:12,639
He pays me 1500 with a smile. - Rich
man, poor man, we're different

479
00:37:12,706 --> 00:37:14,640
So I'm different too, from
someone who'll take a fifty

480
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:17,643
Give me something for a fifty,
a kiss or a hug?

481
00:37:17,711 --> 00:37:19,645
50... 100... 200... 500...
1000, enough is enough

482
00:37:19,713 --> 00:37:20,805
Yes

483
00:37:22,149 --> 00:37:23,639
Leave me, let me go

484
00:37:23,717 --> 00:37:25,651
Bring her along

485
00:37:25,819 --> 00:37:29,653
Take her away

486
00:37:36,997 --> 00:37:41,661
Soprano Enterprises, what
can I do for you?

487
00:37:47,741 --> 00:37:50,676
Soprano, there's good news

488
00:37:50,744 --> 00:37:55,681
Our foreign clients have immensely
liked our Indian samples

489
00:37:55,749 --> 00:38:02,678
Calls are coming in from Europe,
America, London, China, Hungary

490
00:38:02,756 --> 00:38:05,691
Everybody's hungry for
Indian beauties...

491
00:38:05,759 --> 00:38:07,852
...soon now, we're going to become...

492
00:38:07,928 --> 00:38:10,692
the world's biggest
wholesale dealers

493
00:38:14,768 --> 00:38:18,704
We're going to be in demand,
we might even float shares.

494
00:38:18,772 --> 00:38:20,205
We can go corporate,

495
00:38:20,274 --> 00:38:26,702
all over the world, in NASDAQ,
in BSE, in CSE

496
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:24,770
Soprano is the king of the world

497
00:40:21,895 --> 00:40:24,159
Thief

498
00:40:24,231 --> 00:40:26,165
Thief! Where?

499
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,835
Put on the lights, lights!
- What are you doing here?

500
00:40:30,904 --> 00:40:34,431
Moonlighting at dawn and you
guys showed me the stars

501
00:40:36,843 --> 00:40:37,901
Let me watch

502
00:41:01,868 --> 00:41:02,926
What's it?

503
00:41:03,937 --> 00:41:06,872
You see... see? Even a
blind man is interested

504
00:41:22,956 --> 00:41:24,150
Who's that girl?

505
00:41:25,959 --> 00:41:28,086
Right across lives my
friend Avtar Singh

506
00:41:28,228 --> 00:41:30,423
His niece, Celina

507
00:41:31,965 --> 00:41:35,162
She's here to rejuvenate his hotel

508
00:41:42,976 --> 00:41:48,175
What a view!
- But this view costs... all of 3000

509
00:41:48,248 --> 00:41:53,242
Tomorrow morning, I come to collect;
boxes not acceptable, understand?

510
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:58,257
If you can't pay, pack and get
lost. - What are you saying?

511
00:41:58,325 --> 00:42:01,920
That rule isn't for you, good man.
Have you heard, the rest of you?

512
00:42:01,995 --> 00:42:05,931
Eleven am tomorrow. Until then, bye

513
00:42:05,999 --> 00:42:10,936
Twosome, you understand? Eleven
am tomorrow, or else...

514
00:42:11,004 --> 00:42:12,528
I'm no Happy Singh

515
00:42:14,274 --> 00:42:15,468
What did he say?

516
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:19,945
Any tensions? Tell me

517
00:42:21,214 --> 00:42:22,340
We two?

518
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,008
Are screwed?

519
00:42:26,286 --> 00:42:27,412
The landlord?

520
00:42:27,954 --> 00:42:29,012
This house?

521
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:31,023
Wants cash? Why?

522
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:32,956
3000 in cash? When?

523
00:42:35,028 --> 00:42:39,965
Tomorrow? Bless my mother
! And otherwise?

524
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,494
Pack?

525
00:42:41,968 --> 00:42:44,368
And leave?

526
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:46,564
Where will we go?

527
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,975
We've no money, now what?

528
00:42:52,245 --> 00:42:53,371
One minute

529
00:43:03,323 --> 00:43:04,585
So much money?

530
00:43:05,058 --> 00:43:08,050
Goodness! That much cash?
Have you been stealing?

531
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:13,532
It's what I saved up
for my eye surgery

532
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,999
Mind-blowing!

533
00:43:15,068 --> 00:43:19,004
Take 3000, throw it
in Happy Singh's face

534
00:43:19,072 --> 00:43:21,131
Mind-blowing! Enough for us

535
00:43:23,009 --> 00:43:24,067
Pay your rent

536
00:43:24,144 --> 00:43:29,275
15-20,000! Enough for
six months' rent

537
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:31,544
Let's stuff it down
the landlord's throat

538
00:43:31,618 --> 00:43:35,019
Besides, we've a fantastic
item, what a view!

539
00:43:37,023 --> 00:43:38,081
Why did you hit me?

540
00:43:38,225 --> 00:43:39,351
What?

541
00:43:41,027 --> 00:43:42,085
His eyes?

542
00:43:43,029 --> 00:43:44,087
Gouge them?

543
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:46,029
Cut up?

544
00:43:47,033 --> 00:43:48,091
Oh, surgery?

545
00:43:49,102 --> 00:43:52,037
It's for your surgery?

546
00:43:52,105 --> 00:43:55,302
But it doesn't mean more
to me than the two of you

547
00:43:55,375 --> 00:43:57,036
We can't use that

548
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:04,039
I can't bear to lose you. For
the first time in my life...

549
00:44:04,117 --> 00:44:11,250
in your company, I've taken to life

550
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:15,652
Friend, I understand nothing
of what you said

551
00:44:18,131 --> 00:44:19,598
But we can't take your money

552
00:44:21,134 --> 00:44:23,068
We got to find some way else

553
00:44:23,136 --> 00:44:24,660
There's another option

554
00:44:25,138 --> 00:44:30,599
Look, it's of no use to me.
Sell it, it's an antique

555
00:44:30,677 --> 00:44:34,340
Money?
- It'll fetch good money

556
00:44:35,148 --> 00:44:38,276
Don't refuse me, please

557
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,094
Yes, tell me

558
00:44:54,167 --> 00:44:56,692
Happy uncle? And that woman?

559
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,104
This is fun!

560
00:45:00,707 --> 00:45:05,110
Now watch! Here's where we'll
live, that's the view we'll watch

561
00:45:07,447 --> 00:45:10,109
And all at Happy Singh's expense

562
00:45:12,452 --> 00:45:14,113
Let me take a look too

563
00:45:22,195 --> 00:45:23,389
Hang on

564
00:45:24,197 --> 00:45:26,256
Yes, speaking

565
00:45:27,133 --> 00:45:28,191
Speak

566
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:30,133
Moonlight Club?
- Moonlight?

567
00:45:30,203 --> 00:45:31,670
Moonlight Club?

568
00:45:31,738 --> 00:45:33,137
Club?

569
00:45:33,206 --> 00:45:34,264
I'll be there

570
00:45:41,481 --> 00:45:42,675
Everybody now

571
00:45:51,758 --> 00:45:53,419
Rock the dance floor

572
00:46:11,244 --> 00:46:14,702
Snatched and taken

573
00:46:18,685 --> 00:46:21,518
Snatched and taken

574
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:31,354
Your hunter's cruelty, my love...

575
00:46:34,601 --> 00:46:39,470
Your hunter's cruelty, my love...

576
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:51,212
snatched, took my heart...

577
00:46:51,284 --> 00:46:56,722
and drove me crazed into love

578
00:47:00,827 --> 00:47:05,389
Your hunter's cruelty, my love...

579
00:47:05,465 --> 00:47:15,238
snatched, took my heart...

580
00:47:15,308 --> 00:47:20,575
and drove me crazed into love

581
00:47:20,647 --> 00:47:22,774
Let me tell you girl, you're
the one I've been waiting

582
00:47:22,849 --> 00:47:25,249
Every day and night you're the
one I've been praying

583
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:27,581
You're my angel

584
00:47:27,654 --> 00:47:29,713
Come up to me, girl

585
00:47:30,323 --> 00:47:32,257
You're my lady

586
00:47:32,759 --> 00:47:35,387
You're the one who's playing
on the run

587
00:47:35,462 --> 00:47:39,262
Making me weak, with the
look so strong

588
00:47:41,434 --> 00:47:44,267
Making me right, when
proving me wrong

589
00:47:48,441 --> 00:47:53,276
Then we met, face to face

590
00:47:53,346 --> 00:47:57,544
When two wayward souls met...

591
00:47:57,617 --> 00:48:02,281
love went the way of sacrifice...

592
00:48:02,355 --> 00:48:06,815
then the love-pangs rose
and sleep was lost

593
00:48:06,893 --> 00:48:11,296
Your hunter's cruelty, my love...

594
00:48:11,364 --> 00:48:20,466
snatched, took my heart...

595
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:25,307
and drove me crazed into love

596
00:48:26,379 --> 00:48:30,645
Tell me, baby tell me

597
00:48:30,717 --> 00:48:39,318
Want you all the time, all
the time, o'love

598
00:48:54,507 --> 00:48:58,739
Which arrow pierced me, I don't know

599
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:03,510
All I remember is my heart
melting in passion's flames

600
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:08,350
Then slowly the pain ravaged me

601
00:49:08,421 --> 00:49:12,881
And slowly my heart lost its peace

602
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:17,362
Your hunter's duplicity, my love...

603
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:26,498
snatched, took my heart...

604
00:49:26,573 --> 00:49:31,909
and drove me crazed into love

605
00:49:36,716 --> 00:49:43,849
Your hunter's cruelty, my love...

606
00:49:43,923 --> 00:49:49,987
snatched, took my heart...

607
00:49:50,063 --> 00:49:56,400
and drove me crazed into love

608
00:50:21,494 --> 00:50:24,895
This item looks nice, pick her up

609
00:50:33,506 --> 00:50:36,771
Who are you guys, what
are you doing here?

610
00:50:36,843 --> 00:50:38,708
Get out, quick

611
00:50:38,778 --> 00:50:40,837
You don't hear? Out of here, quick

612
00:50:42,615 --> 00:50:45,516
Oh Soprano, your bad luck

613
00:50:52,525 --> 00:50:57,462
Put that photo away, just
say what you want

614
00:51:01,868 --> 00:51:03,460
Happy Singh here

615
00:51:03,536 --> 00:51:06,471
Mr. Happy Singh, I'm the grocer

616
00:51:06,539 --> 00:51:10,600
Your tenant came shopping,
the dumb one.

617
00:51:10,677 --> 00:51:13,475
He's bought a shop load
and he says...

618
00:51:13,546 --> 00:51:17,607
you're footing the bill.
- Rogue, scoundrel, bastard

619
00:51:17,684 --> 00:51:19,481
Whom are you cursing?

620
00:51:19,552 --> 00:51:25,957
Not you, I'm cursing your shopper.
Let him have the stuff

621
00:51:26,025 --> 00:51:30,485
I'll come and pay you, personally.
Don't come home with the bill

622
00:51:31,564 --> 00:51:33,498
You will? I needn't come asking?

623
00:51:33,566 --> 00:51:35,625
The wife is a dictator, you know

624
00:51:35,835 --> 00:51:38,497
Curse the mother...
- What!

625
00:51:38,571 --> 00:51:39,833
The one who bore you.
- How dare you

626
00:51:39,906 --> 00:51:40,964
No, I'm not cursing you

627
00:51:42,575 --> 00:51:44,839
Put it all on Happy Singh's bill

628
00:51:46,579 --> 00:51:51,778
What are you looking for
? Looking for more?

629
00:51:57,023 --> 00:51:58,513
What's he trying to get across?

630
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:02,994
Boss, I got it. He's praising
all five daughters of yours,

631
00:52:03,062 --> 00:52:06,520
each one is better than the other.
If you may let him have one,

632
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:08,999
he'll make do with her

633
00:52:10,136 --> 00:52:13,537
You mutt! You want to make
do with my daughter?

634
00:52:13,606 --> 00:52:16,541
You mean you won't? Then what is
the allusion to my daughters?

635
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:19,544
What else do you want?

636
00:52:19,612 --> 00:52:20,670
What's there?

637
00:52:21,614 --> 00:52:24,947
The 501-brand soap? The just say so

638
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:29,750
And you smart ass, he meant soap
and you made out my daughters?

639
00:52:29,822 --> 00:52:33,758
He's a shopper, not a Romeo

640
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:39,823
What a girl

641
00:52:40,633 --> 00:52:42,567
How do I woo her?

642
00:52:42,635 --> 00:52:44,034
Idea

643
00:52:50,643 --> 00:52:53,976
On her way back jogging,
she falls into this hole

644
00:52:54,647 --> 00:52:57,582
Then I save her and I emerge a hero

645
00:53:05,925 --> 00:53:08,587
Don't cling.
- I'm tired

646
00:53:08,661 --> 00:53:10,856
Where does she go jogging,
I can't spot her

647
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:12,591
Hold on

648
00:53:12,665 --> 00:53:17,932
The municipal guys
leave gutters open

649
00:53:18,004 --> 00:53:21,599
Had it not been for me, you
would've fallen right in

650
00:53:21,674 --> 00:53:23,938
And you'd become lame and blind

651
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:28,606
You're saved because of me,
now say thanks to me - Thanks

652
00:53:28,681 --> 00:53:30,615
Wait, I'll close the manhole

653
00:53:30,683 --> 00:53:36,019
Yes, shut it, it's a trap
for blind men like me

654
00:53:38,124 --> 00:53:39,614
Have you shut it?
- Yes

655
00:53:39,692 --> 00:53:41,751
Good.
- A bag of groceries?

656
00:53:41,828 --> 00:53:44,228
Here?
- Cereals and bread

657
00:53:44,297 --> 00:53:46,629
Also chips.
- That's dinner

658
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:49,167
We're partying tonight, run!

659
00:53:53,973 --> 00:53:56,703
For guys with eyes, girls
are easy anywhere

660
00:53:56,776 --> 00:54:00,644
But someone like me
has to do it indoors

661
00:54:03,649 --> 00:54:04,707
Hello...

662
00:54:05,718 --> 00:54:07,185
Anyone there?

663
00:54:08,821 --> 00:54:11,654
What are you trying?
- Sorry, uncle

664
00:54:12,725 --> 00:54:13,783
Hello...
- Tell me

665
00:54:15,061 --> 00:54:17,052
So her dad is dying of tuberculosis

666
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:21,190
Uncle, would you happen to know
me? I'm right across the street

667
00:54:21,267 --> 00:54:24,668
Who doesn't know you?
You made balloons...

668
00:54:24,737 --> 00:54:27,672
...out of condoms for
the kids at the party

669
00:54:29,742 --> 00:54:35,681
Sorry uncle, bad mistake.
I can't see

670
00:54:36,749 --> 00:54:41,743
Actually I'm here in Mumbai looking
for a cure for my lifeless eyes

671
00:54:42,755 --> 00:54:47,089
I need... your support

672
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,697
Yes yes, why not. Come in.
- Thank you, thank you uncle

673
00:54:52,765 --> 00:54:55,893
Careful, the steps. Come in, son

674
00:54:55,968 --> 00:54:57,902
Uncle, you are so kind

675
00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:00,234
Stand here, one minute

676
00:55:05,778 --> 00:55:07,712
Here you are, son.
- Yes?

677
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:12,183
Two hundred rupees.
- No uncle, you're getting me wrong

678
00:55:12,251 --> 00:55:15,243
I don't need money, please.
- Bravo!

679
00:55:15,788 --> 00:55:18,052
A man ought to have so
much self-esteem...

680
00:55:18,124 --> 00:55:21,184
...one ought never to accept charity

681
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,125
Right sir.
- You can do something for me

682
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:26,187
Sure! Anything for you, uncle

683
00:55:26,265 --> 00:55:27,732
Good, now bend down

684
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,930
Bend down... why? If
you won't bend...

685
00:55:32,004 --> 00:55:34,336
how will I get on top of you?
- On top of me?

686
00:55:34,407 --> 00:55:35,738
Unless I get on top of you,
how can I get knocking

687
00:55:35,808 --> 00:55:37,207
Get knocking?
- Yes

688
00:55:37,276 --> 00:55:40,734
Uncle...
- Son, for two long days...

689
00:55:40,813 --> 00:55:44,214
I've been looking for someone in
vain and now you come volunteering

690
00:55:44,283 --> 00:55:47,741
I'm like a son to you!
- That's just why son, bend down

691
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:50,345
Just stay down while I get done

692
00:55:51,824 --> 00:55:55,760
Let me mount you, just stay down

693
00:55:57,830 --> 00:56:02,767
Don't move, I'll be through, give
me two minutes of knocking

694
00:56:06,939 --> 00:56:08,998
Hurry up!
- Here I come

695
00:56:09,075 --> 00:56:11,839
Thank you son, I'm done

696
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:14,903
You didn't think of using
a table or a chair

697
00:56:14,981 --> 00:56:20,044
Two days ago, I tried using a
chair and a table, both crashed

698
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:21,780
That's why I asked you to bend

699
00:56:21,854 --> 00:56:26,791
Uncle, your work is done. Now
my part of the deal, please

700
00:56:26,859 --> 00:56:29,259
Your part of the deal?
- Will you let me meet Celina?

701
00:56:29,328 --> 00:56:32,855
Celina? Celina isn't at home.
- Yes... what?

702
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:35,799
Much ado about nothing

703
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:44,070
How do I impress Celina enough
to make her walk into my arms?

704
00:56:46,812 --> 00:56:47,870
Celina!

705
00:56:55,154 --> 00:56:58,817
For once, just let our eyes meet

706
00:57:28,054 --> 00:57:29,180
Where is she gone?

707
00:57:32,925 --> 00:57:35,860
I'm sure she never
spotted me, else...

708
00:57:35,928 --> 00:57:39,455
...no one can miss
such a handsome boy

709
00:57:39,932 --> 00:57:41,058
It's okay,

710
00:57:41,133 --> 00:57:43,260
next time

711
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:46,870
Anybody home?

712
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,135
Everyone just died?

713
00:57:50,876 --> 00:57:51,934
Hello

714
00:57:56,882 --> 00:57:57,940
He's home alone

715
00:57:59,051 --> 00:58:02,282
Watch... you and I...

716
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:06,882
are locked in a lonely room
and the keys are lost

717
00:58:16,969 --> 00:58:18,231
Cute kid

718
00:58:24,243 --> 00:58:25,437
Smell of fish?

719
00:58:32,985 --> 00:58:34,919
You?
- I'm the one, am I not?

720
00:58:34,987 --> 00:58:36,249
What for have you come here?

721
00:58:36,322 --> 00:58:41,919
With a pomfret for you, you want?
- I want none of it, go away

722
00:58:41,994 --> 00:58:44,053
I'm not going away.
- What did you say?

723
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:47,395
I... am not... going away

724
00:58:48,267 --> 00:58:49,461
Then I'm going

725
00:58:49,535 --> 00:58:51,196
Then I'm coming after you

726
00:58:53,005 --> 00:58:55,064
What are you doing in the kitchen?

727
00:58:57,009 --> 00:59:01,343
Hold on, let me do it for you.
- Don't touch my eggs, go away

728
00:59:03,015 --> 00:59:07,145
Why? You don't like me? - I can't
get anything of what you say

729
00:59:07,219 --> 00:59:12,953
Go away please, please leave.
- Look, let me learn your lingo

730
00:59:13,025 --> 00:59:18,361
You should learn my lingo.
- What's all this signaling?

731
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,557
Duffer.
- Go away, please

732
00:59:21,033 --> 00:59:24,298
What are you up to?
- Something else on your mind?

733
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:29,171
I don't like girls in traditional
costumes, only girls in jeans

734
00:59:29,975 --> 00:59:33,502
Jeans?

735
00:59:33,579 --> 00:59:35,171
Then you should've said so

736
00:59:35,314 --> 00:59:40,513
For your sake, I'll turn myself
into a girl in jeans. Afterwards...

737
00:59:41,053 --> 00:59:47,583
if you won't accept me, then
I'll cut you up like fish

738
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:10,346
Soprano, you also
know how to dance?

739
01:00:10,416 --> 01:00:12,008
You are great

740
01:00:16,088 --> 01:00:17,350
Not great

741
01:00:20,092 --> 01:00:23,289
Greatest... greatest

742
01:00:33,105 --> 01:00:36,632
Soprano, after all this
dance practice...

743
01:00:36,709 --> 01:00:40,236
...will you send us to
contest Indian Idol?

744
01:00:40,312 --> 01:00:41,438
Idiots

745
01:00:44,383 --> 01:00:47,045
I'm trying to give you
a hint, it's time...

746
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:49,246
...for the festival of nine nights...

747
01:00:49,321 --> 01:00:55,055
the nine nights when girls pretend...

748
01:00:55,127 --> 01:01:00,394
...to be dolled-up
Karinas-Preetis-Ranis

749
01:01:00,466 --> 01:01:06,063
Then they go dancing into the nights,
unawares of the Soprano-men...

750
01:01:06,138 --> 01:01:10,074
who'll be there, waiting for them;
then in between the dances...

751
01:01:10,142 --> 01:01:12,076
my men will kidnap them
and bring them here

752
01:01:12,144 --> 01:01:14,669
Then we'll dispatch them
to foreign countries

753
01:01:43,442 --> 01:01:48,106
Steps ahead... move it blind man.
- Where? Up on the stage?

754
01:01:50,449 --> 01:01:56,115
I want to dance.
- Someone dance with me

755
01:01:58,624 --> 01:02:00,615
What are you doing?
- Step back

756
01:02:00,693 --> 01:02:02,627
Watch your step

757
01:02:05,464 --> 01:02:06,658
Don't push me

758
01:02:08,467 --> 01:02:09,525
Don't push

759
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:11,262
I only want to dance

760
01:02:14,206 --> 01:02:16,606
Why are you pushing me?
- Let me dance

761
01:02:16,675 --> 01:02:19,473
Will someone dance with me...
someone, anyone...

762
01:02:20,212 --> 01:02:23,477
He won't let me dance,
who does he think he is

763
01:02:23,549 --> 01:02:25,141
I'm going to complain

764
01:02:31,223 --> 01:02:34,624
They invite us, then they insult us,
what are the rules of this dance?

765
01:02:34,693 --> 01:02:36,160
Come... just sit.

766
01:02:40,232 --> 01:02:41,358
What are you trying? Get out.
- Let's go

767
01:02:43,235 --> 01:02:44,429
Yes, join the dance

768
01:02:47,172 --> 01:02:48,230
Stand aside

769
01:02:49,174 --> 01:02:50,766
Nice
- Nice pairing

770
01:02:52,378 --> 01:02:53,640
Now watch the show

771
01:04:02,781 --> 01:04:10,586
Can't live a lonely life...

772
01:04:11,423 --> 01:04:19,387
Can't live a lonely life...

773
01:04:20,332 --> 01:04:33,268
without you my mate, I've no peace

774
01:04:33,345 --> 01:04:41,275
Can't live a lonely life...

775
01:05:03,642 --> 01:05:05,837
Everywhere...

776
01:05:05,911 --> 01:05:08,311
your face,

777
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:12,510
your every memory comes alive,

778
01:05:12,584 --> 01:05:16,520
coloring my passions,

779
01:05:16,588 --> 01:05:20,649
darker than any earthly color

780
01:05:20,726 --> 01:05:24,321
I give you my being,
I give you my heart

781
01:05:24,396 --> 01:05:26,330
Here's my story of me and you

782
01:05:26,398 --> 01:05:28,593
My passions, prayers, all for you

783
01:05:28,834 --> 01:05:38,334
Without my mate, I've no peace

784
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:46,340
This loneliness is unbearable

785
01:06:04,436 --> 01:06:08,372
Mad, mad rushes of the heart,

786
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:12,843
what an overwhelming craving

787
01:06:12,911 --> 01:06:16,904
But you don't know,

788
01:06:17,449 --> 01:06:19,383
oh you won't know...

789
01:06:19,451 --> 01:06:20,918
how heartbeats race

790
01:06:20,986 --> 01:06:22,783
You're my life

791
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:24,913
I'm in love with you

792
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:27,390
In you, I lose myself

793
01:06:27,459 --> 01:06:29,518
In you, I've found every joy

794
01:06:29,895 --> 01:06:38,530
Without you my mate,
I've no peace,

795
01:06:38,604 --> 01:06:46,602
in loneliness, I
can't bear to live

796
01:07:08,605 --> 01:07:13,008
When my breath flows from you,

797
01:07:13,076 --> 01:07:17,604
every anxious moment stretches
like a season before me...

798
01:07:17,681 --> 01:07:25,554
and my world is waiting for you,
my heart pining in every beat

799
01:07:25,622 --> 01:07:27,351
For you, I am waiting

800
01:07:27,424 --> 01:07:29,483
For you, my passion waits

801
01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:31,686
For you, my ecstasy waits

802
01:07:31,761 --> 01:07:34,161
For you, my love waits

803
01:07:34,231 --> 01:07:43,037
Without you my mate, I
cannot rise to ecstasy

804
01:07:43,106 --> 01:07:51,036
alone, I've no wish
to crest the peak

805
01:07:52,115 --> 01:07:59,647
alone, I've no wish
to crest the peak

806
01:08:02,058 --> 01:08:03,116
What happened?

807
01:08:03,193 --> 01:08:05,058
Where's Celina?

808
01:08:05,128 --> 01:08:10,065
Come on, quick...
- Where's Celina gone?

809
01:08:11,134 --> 01:08:12,658
Quick, come

810
01:08:12,736 --> 01:08:14,397
Wait, I've to climb down steps

811
01:08:15,672 --> 01:08:18,402
Hey two some, are you ditching me?

812
01:08:22,412 --> 01:08:24,073
Hey guys, you can't do this to me.

813
01:08:24,147 --> 01:08:25,273
Leave me!

814
01:08:25,415 --> 01:08:26,746
Who are you?

815
01:08:27,217 --> 01:08:29,082
You let go of Celina!

816
01:08:30,153 --> 01:08:31,415
Where is Celina?

817
01:08:33,356 --> 01:08:35,688
Fool! Take photos!

818
01:08:48,705 --> 01:08:50,696
Hold this one

819
01:08:55,245 --> 01:08:56,507
Slipped

820
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:59,112
Taking on a blind man?

821
01:09:01,184 --> 01:09:02,651
No sparing you, now

822
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:09,124
Now you're dancing with Soprano,
so stop wriggling and stand still

823
01:09:10,794 --> 01:09:12,125
Take that scoundrel

824
01:09:12,329 --> 01:09:16,663
Swine, elephant, hippopotamus!
- All cowards

825
01:09:19,202 --> 01:09:23,263
Many thanks to all of you, you
saved my life, thank you

826
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:26,207
In thanking us, you
are embarrassing us...

827
01:09:26,276 --> 01:09:29,336
...As good neighbors, it's our duty

828
01:09:30,347 --> 01:09:32,406
You are... my neighbors?

829
01:09:32,482 --> 01:09:36,145
You don't know us? This is
Tom, I'm Dick, he's Harry

830
01:09:36,219 --> 01:09:39,154
We're right across the street

831
01:09:39,489 --> 01:09:43,823
But I've never seen you.
- We see you every day

832
01:09:45,362 --> 01:09:48,160
He said something? He did?

833
01:09:48,498 --> 01:09:53,162
He... watches her?

834
01:09:53,503 --> 01:09:56,370
Blind fool, what can you watch?

835
01:09:56,506 --> 01:10:00,636
He's blind, can see nothing;
but I watch you every day...

836
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:05,170
when you're on the terrace, doing
workouts. You look exotic

837
01:10:05,515 --> 01:10:07,710
Just like a slice of the Moon

838
01:10:07,784 --> 01:10:10,719
Then you watch me too?
- He's speechless

839
01:10:12,255 --> 01:10:16,316
By the way, I'm so glad to have
met you, thank you so much

840
01:10:17,727 --> 01:10:18,785
You too

841
01:10:18,862 --> 01:10:20,523
Okay...
- Bye

842
01:10:21,531 --> 01:10:24,193
Lovely, guys.
- Yes, and I'm inclined...

843
01:10:24,267 --> 01:10:26,531
to present her before you as my wife

844
01:10:27,537 --> 01:10:28,868
Said something again?

845
01:10:31,207 --> 01:10:32,333
She?

846
01:10:33,276 --> 01:10:35,471
Get lost, she's mine just you watch

847
01:10:35,545 --> 01:10:41,211
Enough of this only-mine stuff.
Let's all try our best to get her

848
01:10:41,284 --> 01:10:42,410
Let the best man...

849
01:10:42,485 --> 01:10:45,352
no, that's fair... no?

850
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:48,484
Vanished?

851
01:10:49,426 --> 01:10:51,485
Now she's mine, for sure

852
01:11:12,916 --> 01:11:20,846
Swing, swing

853
01:11:28,598 --> 01:11:32,329
You are my prayer, my desire

854
01:11:32,402 --> 01:11:36,338
In memories of fantasies...

855
01:11:36,406 --> 01:11:40,274
you reign

856
01:11:40,343 --> 01:11:43,471
You set my heart rocking

857
01:11:43,546 --> 01:11:51,282
Swing to it, swing

858
01:12:04,901 --> 01:12:06,835
It's a moment's chance,
lost or found...

859
01:12:06,903 --> 01:12:08,632
but I always find myself
thinking of you,

860
01:12:08,705 --> 01:12:12,641
how to stop myself, mate?

861
01:12:20,383 --> 01:12:22,317
Untamed memories,

862
01:12:22,385 --> 01:12:24,319
uncontrollable moments...

863
01:12:24,387 --> 01:12:32,317
without you, no peace
nowhere, mate

864
01:12:32,395 --> 01:12:39,324
You've set my heart rocking

865
01:12:39,402 --> 01:12:46,740
Swing to it, swing

866
01:13:06,563 --> 01:13:13,969
None one but you in mind's
universe, horizons, mate

867
01:13:21,711 --> 01:13:33,452
You pervade my mindscape, my heart
and being and body and soul, mate

868
01:13:33,523 --> 01:13:40,656
You've set my heart rocking

869
01:13:40,730 --> 01:13:48,728
Swing to it, swing

870
01:14:16,032 --> 01:14:19,433
Dick boy...

871
01:14:19,769 --> 01:14:22,431
I'm rather ashamed
to speak your name

872
01:14:22,772 --> 01:14:27,709
Look at your belly and mine...
how can you see, let me explain

873
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:31,505
Your belly, flat like an expressway

874
01:14:31,581 --> 01:14:39,454
Mine resembles an arching flyover,
it only grows with more exercise

875
01:14:39,522 --> 01:14:43,788
And the more the belly arches, the
lesser is my wife's interest in me

876
01:14:44,127 --> 01:14:47,460
That's why I go after maids, I'm
not a pervert, I'm helpless

877
01:14:48,064 --> 01:14:50,658
I say, you should hire a maid too,
all ends will be served

878
01:14:51,134 --> 01:14:52,601
Come off it Happy

879
01:14:53,936 --> 01:14:55,995
Harry, what's the matter?

880
01:14:56,539 --> 01:14:57,665
Tell me

881
01:14:58,941 --> 01:15:00,738
A phone call? I'll take it

882
01:15:02,145 --> 01:15:03,806
Try and express it properly

883
01:15:05,548 --> 01:15:09,484
Oh drop it, you aren't
Amitabh Bachchan in...

884
01:15:09,552 --> 01:15:11,076
...Black nor I am Rani Mukherjee...

885
01:15:11,154 --> 01:15:13,486
to understand your unspoken
word. So forget it

886
01:15:14,157 --> 01:15:16,625
You want me to explain? Yes, start

887
01:15:18,094 --> 01:15:20,494
You... asleep? He was asleep

888
01:15:22,165 --> 01:15:24,827
Died?
- Who, Tom?

889
01:15:26,569 --> 01:15:27,627
Up in a fire?

890
01:15:27,704 --> 01:15:28,830
Down the drain?

891
01:15:28,971 --> 01:15:31,166
What happened was, I was asleep

892
01:15:31,841 --> 01:15:35,106
In sleep... a dream.
He dreamt a dream

893
01:15:35,778 --> 01:15:37,507
And it must've been about Celina?
...

894
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:39,514
...You've been dreaming
about my wife?

895
01:15:39,849 --> 01:15:41,840
One minute, let him speak

896
01:15:42,652 --> 01:15:45,519
Who else was there in
that dream with you?

897
01:15:45,588 --> 01:15:46,919
He was?
- Yes!

898
01:15:46,989 --> 01:15:49,048
And?
- The deaf guy too? Yes...

899
01:15:49,125 --> 01:15:50,524
was I there?

900
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:52,657
Damn you

901
01:15:52,862 --> 01:15:54,523
Anyway, what do you dream?

902
01:15:54,864 --> 01:15:57,856
Someone got you... by the butt?

903
01:15:58,868 --> 01:16:01,530
Someone who sways at hips?

904
01:16:02,004 --> 01:16:04,529
Oh, the fisherwoman was there too?

905
01:16:05,808 --> 01:16:07,070
Then?

906
01:16:08,544 --> 01:16:09,670
Cap

907
01:16:10,613 --> 01:16:12,547
Celina put a foolscap on you?

908
01:16:13,216 --> 01:16:16,014
Celina was wearing a cap and
sucking on a sugarcane?

909
01:16:16,219 --> 01:16:17,550
Shut up, shut up, shut up,

910
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:21,147
shut up! Okay, come again.
Don't get angry

911
01:16:21,224 --> 01:16:23,886
A man in a cap, bearded. A
bearded man wearing a cap

912
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:25,825
And what was he doing?
Sucking a sugarcane?

913
01:16:25,895 --> 01:16:27,692
The bearded guy wearing
a cap was singing

914
01:16:27,764 --> 01:16:32,565
A bearded guy in a cap, singing?
Himesh Reshamiyya's!

915
01:16:33,636 --> 01:16:37,572
What a dream! Of late, you're
seeing multi-starrer dreams?

916
01:16:38,107 --> 01:16:45,104
While the two of you keep dreaming,
your mate will vamoose with Celina

917
01:16:45,181 --> 01:16:47,581
Only if we let someone do vamoosing

918
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:48,844
Mr. Constable?

919
01:16:49,185 --> 01:16:51,585
Police! Hands up!

920
01:16:51,654 --> 01:16:53,918
The threesome made lots
of trouble last night

921
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:58,586
The Inspector wants to see
them right away, follow me

922
01:16:59,262 --> 01:17:00,923
Sir, I've brought in all three.
- Good

923
01:17:00,997 --> 01:17:02,931
Thy are the ones.
- Welcome

924
01:17:03,866 --> 01:17:05,595
I am over here

925
01:17:06,669 --> 01:17:10,605
So, the three heroes?
- Yes

926
01:17:10,673 --> 01:17:12,197
Look... over there...

927
01:17:12,742 --> 01:17:16,610
What?
- The younger generation...

928
01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:20,206
should follow your example.
Be seated...

929
01:17:20,283 --> 01:17:21,944
...- The example is meant
for youngsters,

930
01:17:22,018 --> 01:17:23,610
not for you.
- You were making a statement?

931
01:17:23,686 --> 01:17:25,620
Just a slip of the tongue

932
01:17:26,889 --> 01:17:29,949
We've no wish to join
the police force

933
01:17:31,961 --> 01:17:34,156
Doesn't ring?
- It's ringing

934
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:35,629
That's what I'm saying

935
01:17:35,765 --> 01:17:37,164
Doesn't ring

936
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,231
It's ringing

937
01:17:39,836 --> 01:17:41,303
Not working?

938
01:17:42,705 --> 01:17:44,229
Are you deaf?

939
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:51,906
The three of you put up
a fight with those goons

940
01:17:52,315 --> 01:17:56,046
Therefore, you have seen the goons

941
01:17:56,719 --> 01:18:01,656
Now, tell our sketch artiste
what the goons look like,

942
01:18:01,724 --> 01:18:06,661
to enable him to draw their sketches
so that we can get the gang quickly

943
01:18:06,729 --> 01:18:10,665
You don't need sketches
to get them...

944
01:18:10,733 --> 01:18:14,191
...I'll show you the
way to get to them

945
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:15,669
You will?

946
01:18:15,738 --> 01:18:17,672
Blind man's show?
- I may be blind

947
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:20,072
But I'm always going around with
a camera, and you know what...

948
01:18:20,142 --> 01:18:22,667
I'm always clicking away

949
01:18:23,012 --> 01:18:24,274
What's he saying?

950
01:18:24,347 --> 01:18:28,750
During the fight, I clicked
photos from every angle

951
01:18:28,885 --> 01:18:30,819
Where are the photos?
- Inside the camera

952
01:18:30,887 --> 01:18:32,946
Where's the camera?
- In a room

953
01:18:33,022 --> 01:18:35,013
Where's the room.
- Inside the house

954
01:18:35,091 --> 01:18:36,683
Where's the house?
- Nearby

955
01:18:37,026 --> 01:18:39,153
Wait for 15 minutes, I'll
be back in an hour

956
01:18:39,228 --> 01:18:41,219
I'll wait for 15 minutes,
you'll be back in an hour?

957
01:18:41,297 --> 01:18:43,697
I'll be shuttling back and forth.
- What need?

958
01:18:43,766 --> 01:18:47,702
I've twenty cars waiting outside,
pick one, go and come back

959
01:18:47,770 --> 01:18:49,704
Police cars never arrive anywhere
in any nick of time

960
01:18:49,772 --> 01:18:52,172
What did you say?
- Excuse me, sir

961
01:18:53,709 --> 01:18:54,903
Let's go

962
01:18:56,779 --> 01:19:01,716
He returns with their photos
and I nab the goons

963
01:19:01,784 --> 01:19:04,184
And once I've nabbed them,
I'll get a huge promotion

964
01:19:04,253 --> 01:19:05,720
Thank you

965
01:19:15,064 --> 01:19:18,864
Not mere photographs,
it's my career...

966
01:19:19,802 --> 01:19:21,736
in photographs

967
01:19:39,822 --> 01:19:42,757
Those are their photos

968
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:46,827
Where are the photos of the goons?

969
01:19:49,031 --> 01:19:52,762
Maybe... I took the wrong angles

970
01:19:52,835 --> 01:19:56,771
I feel like changing every
angle in your body

971
01:19:56,973 --> 01:19:59,771
I feel like booking you...

972
01:19:59,842 --> 01:20:01,776
on every possible charge,

973
01:20:01,844 --> 01:20:05,041
from organized to petty crime

974
01:20:05,848 --> 01:20:06,974
He said what?

975
01:20:07,249 --> 01:20:12,243
Which I can't do, because
I need you fro the sketches

976
01:20:12,388 --> 01:20:16,119
Put them away, until the
sketch-wallah arrives. Get out!

977
01:20:17,059 --> 01:20:20,927
Why are you shouting? This is too
much. We saw nothing, goodbye

978
01:20:20,997 --> 01:20:25,866
No! Don't go away! Stay, please!

979
01:20:25,935 --> 01:20:30,804
Why is he begging? - I'll beg
at your feet, don't leave!

980
01:20:30,873 --> 01:20:32,340
Stay, please...

981
01:20:32,408 --> 01:20:34,808
Fix that bell.
- I'll do anything, please stay

982
01:20:34,877 --> 01:20:36,811
Wait, please

983
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:39,211
They're gone?

984
01:20:39,348 --> 01:20:41,816
Soprano, those rascals
have seen my...

985
01:20:41,884 --> 01:20:45,820
...face.
- Not only that. The threesome...

986
01:20:45,888 --> 01:20:49,415
went to the police station.
- If you say so,

987
01:20:49,492 --> 01:20:52,825
we can ensure that the
threesome is no more

988
01:20:58,501 --> 01:21:01,834
Send your men, kill the bastards

989
01:21:03,039 --> 01:21:05,371
Noble villains...

990
01:21:06,308 --> 01:21:08,833
once again, wrong advice

991
01:21:09,445 --> 01:21:15,850
The poor cripples that they are, a
few words are enough to kill them

992
01:21:16,318 --> 01:21:21,187
In this age of satellites,
telephonic threats are enough

993
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:39,007
Hello, one second

994
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:44,145
Hello defective pieces

995
01:21:46,148 --> 01:21:50,482
I get to hear that your
software's are corrupt

996
01:21:50,953 --> 01:21:54,013
You want me to crash
your hard discs?

997
01:21:54,156 --> 01:21:55,885
Who's it?

998
01:21:55,958 --> 01:21:58,153
Very friendly with the police?

999
01:21:58,227 --> 01:22:02,357
Mummy never told you that making
friends with cops is no good?

1000
01:22:02,965 --> 01:22:04,899
You don't watch Bollywood films?

1001
01:22:04,967 --> 01:22:09,165
The police is in cohorts
with the likes of us

1002
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:13,902
Bloody stupid-idiot-nonsensical
people, deaf-blind-mutes

1003
01:22:13,976 --> 01:22:17,434
you want to mess with me?

1004
01:22:17,513 --> 01:22:18,912
You want to take me on?

1005
01:22:18,981 --> 01:22:21,449
One second, one second...
- Yes?

1006
01:22:21,517 --> 01:22:24,315
Ballad Split it?

1007
01:22:25,254 --> 01:22:30,248
Ball... lad? Get rid
of lad, keep ball?

1008
01:22:30,593 --> 01:22:31,924
One second...

1009
01:22:32,995 --> 01:22:34,929
What was that? Karate?

1010
01:22:36,265 --> 01:22:39,257
Man who? Van Damme?

1011
01:22:40,469 --> 01:22:42,937
Bruce Lee Split Bruce Lee?

1012
01:22:43,005 --> 01:22:47,942
Dump Bruce, keep Lee, then?

1013
01:22:48,544 --> 01:22:51,206
That one? Ball? Lee?

1014
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:55,944
Ball Lee... bully?

1015
01:22:56,018 --> 01:22:57,076
What, a bully?

1016
01:22:57,286 --> 01:23:01,154
You dog, you rogue, you bastard,
you dare bully my friend?

1017
01:23:01,223 --> 01:23:03,157
If you've the guts,
come out in the open

1018
01:23:04,026 --> 01:23:07,484
And I'll shove that phone
down your throat

1019
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:09,962
Me too.
- Go ahead

1020
01:23:10,032 --> 01:23:11,966
You dog!

1021
01:23:12,034 --> 01:23:14,559
Soprano, they're talking code

1022
01:23:14,637 --> 01:23:17,162
In the underworld, they're
connected, maybe more than us

1023
01:23:17,239 --> 01:23:19,969
I'll kill you like a dog!
- Pass that to me

1024
01:23:20,309 --> 01:23:23,244
Put on your brakes

1025
01:23:24,046 --> 01:23:26,981
Swine! No, you're swine,
you must be a fly

1026
01:23:27,049 --> 01:23:29,449
I am Ray More, I'll make you no-more

1027
01:23:29,518 --> 01:23:30,985
If you use foul language...

1028
01:23:31,053 --> 01:23:33,988
Shut up, Shut up, Shut up...
- I'll screw you online

1029
01:23:34,056 --> 01:23:35,114
Shut up

1030
01:23:35,324 --> 01:23:37,986
Your parents made mistakes, you dogs

1031
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:41,325
Your turn... no you mutt...
give that back to me

1032
01:23:42,331 --> 01:23:44,993
Dog, coward, swine

1033
01:23:46,068 --> 01:23:47,535
Hold on, a second... what?

1034
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:49,332
Hung up?

1035
01:23:50,272 --> 01:23:52,263
Scared?
- Bloody scared

1036
01:23:52,474 --> 01:23:58,538
I'll hack them to pieces for every
piece of foul language that they used

1037
01:23:59,481 --> 01:24:01,415
But I won't count the pieces

1038
01:24:01,617 --> 01:24:04,017
Mr. Grocer, I told you, don't
come home, but if you insist,

1039
01:24:04,086 --> 01:24:08,614
don't raise your voice,
my wife will throw me out

1040
01:24:08,691 --> 01:24:12,024
The boys bought the supplies,
I didn't, how am I to blame?

1041
01:24:12,094 --> 01:24:16,030
And how am I to blame? You
were telephoning me saying,

1042
01:24:16,098 --> 01:24:20,091
let them have it, let-them-have-it,
imagine what the bill is like?

1043
01:24:20,169 --> 01:24:23,036
Hush, my wife will drive
me out of my home

1044
01:24:23,105 --> 01:24:26,563
Hush? 11,470. That's the
bill, so please pay up

1045
01:24:26,642 --> 01:24:32,308
11,470... over how many years?
- Years? A month's bill

1046
01:24:32,381 --> 01:24:37,512
11,470 billed in a month?
Do they eat or hog it?

1047
01:24:37,586 --> 01:24:39,053
Anything else?

1048
01:24:39,121 --> 01:24:41,385
More. What's the bill for the milk?

1049
01:24:41,457 --> 01:24:43,049
4,500.
- Take that

1050
01:24:43,125 --> 01:24:47,061
4,500 worth of milk, do
they bathe in milk?

1051
01:24:47,129 --> 01:24:48,596
What more?
- Wait a minute

1052
01:24:48,664 --> 01:24:53,465
Mr. Khan, speak up.
- I gave them 5,000 in cash

1053
01:24:53,535 --> 01:24:57,062
They're borrowing on my account?
- Correct

1054
01:24:57,406 --> 01:24:59,533
Mr. Grocer, let's do it this way...

1055
01:24:59,608 --> 01:25:05,069
keep this 10,000. I'll see you
later. - What good is 10,000?

1056
01:25:05,147 --> 01:25:07,138
Share the spoils, I'll
see you later...

1057
01:25:07,216 --> 01:25:09,081
...- Otherwise, I'll
have to come back

1058
01:25:09,151 --> 01:25:11,619
You have no faith in my word?

1059
01:25:11,687 --> 01:25:13,552
Tone down,

1060
01:25:13,622 --> 01:25:15,283
your wife might hear

1061
01:25:15,758 --> 01:25:18,420
He understands. Do come and settle
- Sure

1062
01:25:18,494 --> 01:25:20,428
Let's go, I'll pay your share

1063
01:25:22,431 --> 01:25:28,097
Happy Singh, unless you fix
these apes soon enough...

1064
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Give me the broom, you will
break the bulb. Get down

1065
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Can't you work properly?
Keep this aside

1066
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Bring the table here

1067
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
This side.

1068
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
You relax, uncle

1069
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,068
Praise the Lord

1070
01:25:57,713 --> 01:25:59,578
Thank you, dear

1071
01:26:00,182 --> 01:26:04,050
You have set my restaurant going
that was shut down for years

1072
01:26:04,186 --> 01:26:06,586
I'm elated, dear

1073
01:26:13,129 --> 01:26:17,259
Thank you.
- My dream has also come true, uncle

1074
01:26:20,202 --> 01:26:22,932
My best wishes are always with you

1075
01:26:23,272 --> 01:26:26,605
Mr. Happy, is she here?

1076
01:26:26,675 --> 01:26:31,078
No, she isn't here yet. You've stood
me up at the window since morning

1077
01:26:31,147 --> 01:26:34,082
For your dame, my maid
will go away. I'm off

1078
01:26:34,150 --> 01:26:36,880
Go on. I'm going too

1079
01:26:37,219 --> 01:26:40,620
Where will you go?
- Nothing to worry

1080
01:26:40,689 --> 01:26:44,216
I'm going to your wife, to show
her a picture of your black deeds

1081
01:26:44,293 --> 01:26:47,626
The three of you are jerks.
You guys have a picture...

1082
01:26:47,696 --> 01:26:50,893
in your pockets, and you are
always blackmailing me

1083
01:26:50,966 --> 01:26:53,628
We're helpless. You are my eyes

1084
01:26:53,969 --> 01:26:57,905
With the help of your eyes,
I see through my heart

1085
01:26:57,973 --> 01:27:03,240
I see what she is wearing,
I see... she is here!

1086
01:27:03,312 --> 01:27:07,646
No.
- I'm telling you, she is here

1087
01:27:07,783 --> 01:27:11,776
Fool. I can see. She is not here.
You are blind, how can you be sure?

1088
01:27:11,854 --> 01:27:15,255
You are lying. I can smell
her. She is here

1089
01:27:15,324 --> 01:27:18,657
You must get your nose treated
along with your eyes

1090
01:27:18,794 --> 01:27:21,661
Who are you looking for?
- You, of course

1091
01:27:26,001 --> 01:27:29,994
Ms Celina... you? At
our humble abode?

1092
01:27:31,006 --> 01:27:34,999
I inaugurated my uncle's restaurant.
I just came to offer you sweets

1093
01:27:36,745 --> 01:27:39,737
Cur! Swine!

1094
01:27:39,815 --> 01:27:44,684
This is not fair. They make you work
so much that your hands are swollen

1095
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:47,687
Do you do the dishes
in the restaurant?

1096
01:27:48,023 --> 01:27:50,685
Fool. Here is her hand

1097
01:27:51,026 --> 01:27:53,688
I see. Congratulations again

1098
01:27:54,763 --> 01:27:57,891
Here you are.
- Look...

1099
01:27:59,368 --> 01:28:02,701
I need something else

1100
01:28:03,038 --> 01:28:05,973
What?
- Promise me that...

1101
01:28:06,041 --> 01:28:09,704
you will give it to me.
- What? - A job

1102
01:28:18,787 --> 01:28:20,721
What a joke

1103
01:28:26,328 --> 01:28:29,729
What's wrong with him?
- You guys are here?

1104
01:28:30,065 --> 01:28:34,729
Why do you leave me alone? I was
waiting for you. Have sweets

1105
01:28:34,803 --> 01:28:39,740
What for? You got your eyesight back?
- Eyesight won't make me so glad

1106
01:28:39,808 --> 01:28:42,333
I've got Celina

1107
01:28:42,945 --> 01:28:46,813
Know what? She gave me
a job in her restaurant

1108
01:28:47,816 --> 01:28:49,750
He mentions Celina.
What did you say?

1109
01:28:49,818 --> 01:28:52,286
...
- I'll make good use of my blindness

1110
01:28:52,354 --> 01:28:57,087
I'll touch her here, there...
I'll even pounce on her

1111
01:28:57,293 --> 01:29:00,023
Where is he touching?
- Sorry. I mean...

1112
01:29:00,095 --> 01:29:05,032
I'll apologize to Celina and
tell her that I'm blind. Yes!

1113
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:08,763
Shut up! Explain, buddy. Tell me

1114
01:29:08,837 --> 01:29:13,365
Handicaps, you have wasted my time

1115
01:29:13,442 --> 01:29:16,240
My sweetheart is waiting
for me, I must go

1116
01:29:16,312 --> 01:29:19,770
I only wanted to share
the good news. Bye

1117
01:29:19,915 --> 01:29:23,783
Oh yes, if it has gone
over Mr. Deaf's head...

1118
01:29:23,852 --> 01:29:29,791
then Mr. Dumb, explain to him slowly
in your sign language. Okay?

1119
01:29:29,858 --> 01:29:31,792
Take your time... bye.

1120
01:29:32,127 --> 01:29:35,790
He called you dumb. Explain
to me, what did he say?

1121
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:43,137
Coca Cola for you, sir. - It's
Orange, I asked for Coke - What?

1122
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:48,808
Did he ask for Coke?
- Who is it? Doesn't matter

1123
01:29:49,144 --> 01:29:52,409
I'm the barman. You go
and clean the tables

1124
01:29:52,481 --> 01:29:53,812
What did he say?

1125
01:29:54,149 --> 01:29:59,815
Clean the tables? Hey blind
bat! You clean the tables

1126
01:29:59,888 --> 01:30:03,824
We will clean Celina.
- Harry, you too?

1127
01:30:03,959 --> 01:30:07,360
What are you guys doing here?
- You said you'd touch Celina...

1128
01:30:07,429 --> 01:30:09,363
here, there...
- I didn't

1129
01:30:09,498 --> 01:30:11,159
Now that we are here, we'll
touch here, there...

1130
01:30:11,233 --> 01:30:14,828
Don't touch me! - We'll even
apologize on your behalf

1131
01:30:14,903 --> 01:30:18,168
Now go on, clean the tables.
- Pushing a blind man, eh?

1132
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,832
Aren't you ashamed?

1133
01:30:20,976 --> 01:30:24,377
Don't you touch me!
- Come on

1134
01:30:24,446 --> 01:30:26,846
Where are you going?
- Celina belongs to me

1135
01:30:26,915 --> 01:30:29,850
I won't spare you!
- She'll be in my arms

1136
01:30:29,918 --> 01:30:31,852
Damn you!

1137
01:30:35,457 --> 01:30:37,186
Don't touch me, jerks!

1138
01:30:37,926 --> 01:30:39,917
If you are a real man, take me on!

1139
01:30:44,199 --> 01:30:46,133
Don't touch me from behind!

1140
01:30:47,002 --> 01:30:48,867
Yes! Gotcha!

1141
01:30:50,939 --> 01:30:52,873
Over here, blind bat

1142
01:30:52,941 --> 01:30:56,877
Kidnapper! It's him! Get him

1143
01:30:56,945 --> 01:30:58,879
Harry, stone!

1144
01:31:02,551 --> 01:31:04,018
Why did you hit him?

1145
01:31:05,087 --> 01:31:06,884
Dandiya?

1146
01:31:12,027 --> 01:31:14,894
No connection Tell me

1147
01:31:15,230 --> 01:31:18,165
Him... dandiya... and?

1148
01:31:19,101 --> 01:31:22,901
Fight? The fight during dandiya?
Is he the kidnapper?

1149
01:31:23,105 --> 01:31:26,905
Why didn't you tell me?
- Morons! I've been telling you

1150
01:31:26,975 --> 01:31:30,240
He's the kidnapper I caught
during the dandiya

1151
01:31:31,046 --> 01:31:33,913
He escaped.
- My restaurant!

1152
01:31:33,982 --> 01:31:35,040
What?
- Behind

1153
01:31:35,117 --> 01:31:38,917
My restaurant...
- Please don't be angry, Ms Celina

1154
01:31:38,987 --> 01:31:42,923
The kidnapper who had come during
the dandiya, he was here

1155
01:31:42,991 --> 01:31:45,459
Where is the kidnapper?
- I was there, I caught him

1156
01:31:45,527 --> 01:31:48,928
Did you see him?
- Yes, I saw him

1157
01:31:48,997 --> 01:31:51,932
Which means, he knows
that you guys work here

1158
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,935
We must go to the police station.
Come on, boys

1159
01:31:55,604 --> 01:31:56,935
Careful

1160
01:32:00,008 --> 01:32:04,945
Mirror mirror on the wall

1161
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:08,272
Who is the bad man of all?
- Soprano

1162
01:32:08,417 --> 01:32:13,946
You are the worst.
- Soprano!

1163
01:32:22,231 --> 01:32:23,960
Hear that?

1164
01:32:24,633 --> 01:32:29,502
The greatest villain hangs his head
in shame today because of you

1165
01:32:30,572 --> 01:32:31,971
Two

1166
01:32:33,041 --> 01:32:34,633
Seven

1167
01:32:35,244 --> 01:32:36,973
Nineteen

1168
01:32:37,045 --> 01:32:40,981
Soprano's man gets
nineteen stitches!

1169
01:32:42,651 --> 01:32:47,987
My well wishers, what'd you
have done in my shoes?

1170
01:32:48,257 --> 01:32:51,988
I'd have wrung his neck right there

1171
01:32:54,329 --> 01:32:57,992
Mogambo would've sentenced
him to death

1172
01:32:59,601 --> 01:33:04,004
I'd have given him to the crocodiles

1173
01:33:06,341 --> 01:33:09,003
My man...

1174
01:33:11,079 --> 01:33:13,274
should be shot

1175
01:33:15,017 --> 01:33:18,009
Gabbar, Mogambo, Shakal...

1176
01:33:18,353 --> 01:33:21,618
you know why you are losers?

1177
01:33:22,691 --> 01:33:28,027
Because you killed your own men
and depleted your own powers

1178
01:33:30,365 --> 01:33:32,356
Soprano won't do that

1179
01:33:33,502 --> 01:33:37,029
Soprano will kill his enemy

1180
01:33:40,175 --> 01:33:42,040
I got it, Soprano

1181
01:33:43,378 --> 01:33:47,178
Bloody wastrels. They are back
again. - Inspector sahib...

1182
01:33:47,249 --> 01:33:52,243
they will describe the kidnapper.
- They will describe the kidnapper?

1183
01:33:52,654 --> 01:33:59,059
The blind, mute and deaf... will
they describe the kidnapper?

1184
01:33:59,127 --> 01:34:01,652
The bell doesn't work.
- It is working

1185
01:34:01,730 --> 01:34:04,255
Yes, it's not working

1186
01:34:05,133 --> 01:34:08,261
It is working.
- Get it fixed, sir

1187
01:34:08,403 --> 01:34:11,201
All right, I'll get it fixed

1188
01:34:12,074 --> 01:34:16,067
Who will describe the kidnapper?
- Sir, I will describe

1189
01:34:16,211 --> 01:34:20,079
The blind man will describe him,
eh? You saw him, did you?

1190
01:34:20,148 --> 01:34:24,608
Yes... no, I didn't see
him, but I felt him

1191
01:34:24,686 --> 01:34:29,680
I could smell him. The restaurant
was full, there was chaos all around

1192
01:34:29,758 --> 01:34:34,491
Suddenly the short kidnapper
came before me

1193
01:34:34,563 --> 01:34:37,555
And I held him tight!
- Don't touch her

1194
01:34:37,699 --> 01:34:42,295
Sir, you won't believe, he was
there even at the dandiya

1195
01:34:42,371 --> 01:34:46,774
I smelt him, I felt him.
- Over here

1196
01:34:46,842 --> 01:34:50,107
Did anyone see his face?
- Well...

1197
01:34:50,178 --> 01:34:54,114
Did anyone see his face? - They
will tell you. They are my eyes

1198
01:34:54,783 --> 01:34:58,651
These two? This deaf
man will talk, eh?

1199
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:01,188
Deaf?
- Stop

1200
01:35:01,456 --> 01:35:04,653
Why do they always threaten
me? Tell me

1201
01:35:08,797 --> 01:35:10,128
What?

1202
01:35:10,465 --> 01:35:12,126
A man...

1203
01:35:12,801 --> 01:35:16,532
that man... caught

1204
01:35:17,205 --> 01:35:21,141
Short man... caught. Oh yes,
he held on to the goon

1205
01:35:23,412 --> 01:35:25,676
His... face

1206
01:35:26,281 --> 01:35:28,408
I see. We need to describe him

1207
01:35:28,483 --> 01:35:31,611
That goon... on one condition, sir

1208
01:35:31,687 --> 01:35:34,747
What?
- Don't gape. I understand

1209
01:35:36,425 --> 01:35:38,620
If Celina asks me...

1210
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:41,285
I'll tell her.
- Is he touching his sister-in-law?

1211
01:36:08,523 --> 01:36:13,187
He is touching her? Touching
here there? Dammit

1212
01:36:13,528 --> 01:36:17,191
C'mon, hurry up. Where's that
slink? I must fix him

1213
01:36:17,265 --> 01:36:18,732
Hurry up

1214
01:36:18,867 --> 01:36:20,198
Freak!

1215
01:36:22,537 --> 01:36:28,203
So the hero is humming here

1216
01:36:28,543 --> 01:36:31,740
There's no one in the
restaurant either

1217
01:36:32,347 --> 01:36:34,747
You know what to do, don't you?
- Yes

1218
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:37,808
Go on.
- Let's go. Tell me...

1219
01:36:37,886 --> 01:36:41,481
how do I look?
- Beautiful

1220
01:36:43,558 --> 01:36:46,220
Gosh!
- What happened?

1221
01:36:50,565 --> 01:36:55,559
Thanks. I'm off.
- Let's watch it live

1222
01:37:12,587 --> 01:37:14,248
Celina!

1223
01:37:25,534 --> 01:37:27,399
What's happening?

1224
01:38:25,393 --> 01:38:27,861
At least touch me and explain

1225
01:38:37,539 --> 01:38:38,870
Sorry

1226
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:40,931
You?
- Yes

1227
01:38:41,409 --> 01:38:46,938
You said, you liked girls in jeans

1228
01:38:47,082 --> 01:38:51,348
Here I am in jeans. Tell
me, how do I look?

1229
01:38:51,419 --> 01:38:57,619
How did you come here?
- Your friends told me you are here

1230
01:38:57,692 --> 01:39:01,355
Friends? I see. I'll fix them later

1231
01:39:01,563 --> 01:39:05,363
Get this clear. I don't love you.
- Why not?

1232
01:39:05,433 --> 01:39:10,370
Because I like Celina. And that's
why we are working here. Get that?

1233
01:39:10,438 --> 01:39:13,373
Celina? I'll fix her and you as well

1234
01:39:13,441 --> 01:39:16,376
Bloody swine! Parasite

1235
01:39:18,046 --> 01:39:21,038
That slimy woman! I'll fix her

1236
01:39:24,452 --> 01:39:28,388
Where has Soprano sent us? To kill?

1237
01:39:29,057 --> 01:39:33,721
Or to clean the restaurant?
Not a soul in sight

1238
01:39:36,665 --> 01:39:38,599
There! The two monkeys

1239
01:39:38,867 --> 01:39:43,736
This bomb will fix them for good

1240
01:39:43,939 --> 01:39:46,407
Help me down

1241
01:39:47,475 --> 01:39:49,409
Excuse me, waiter.
- Yes?

1242
01:39:49,477 --> 01:39:52,412
Give me one pinacolada margoretti,
on the rocks

1243
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:56,416
What language is that? - The
restaurant is closed. Come later

1244
01:39:56,551 --> 01:39:58,542
Okay, I'll come later

1245
01:40:05,627 --> 01:40:07,424
What?

1246
01:40:10,765 --> 01:40:15,429
Bloody dogs! Who sent her inside?
- Raped!

1247
01:40:15,503 --> 01:40:17,698
What are you laughing for, blind
bat? Did you see anything?

1248
01:40:17,772 --> 01:40:21,970
Don't try to placate me.
I don't want your gift

1249
01:40:22,110 --> 01:40:24,442
What's that?

1250
01:40:25,513 --> 01:40:27,447
What?

1251
01:40:27,515 --> 01:40:30,450
That man... what happened? His gift?

1252
01:40:30,518 --> 01:40:33,919
I see. I'll give it to him. I'll
come back and fix the two of you

1253
01:40:34,122 --> 01:40:35,453
Sure, go on

1254
01:40:40,528 --> 01:40:46,728
Hello, Soprano? I've planted
the box so cleanly that...

1255
01:40:46,801 --> 01:40:53,730
let alone the three chaps, not even
the wind will know about the bomb

1256
01:40:53,808 --> 01:40:58,472
You know, I've set the
bomb to 30 seconds

1257
01:40:58,813 --> 01:41:03,807
After 30 seconds, there will be
a blast, so enormous that...

1258
01:41:03,885 --> 01:41:07,753
it will rock even America...
- You left your stuff behind, sir

1259
01:41:07,822 --> 01:41:10,484
People will forget 9/11.
- You left your stuff behind

1260
01:41:10,558 --> 01:41:13,493
All the TV channels in the world
will be showing only you

1261
01:41:13,561 --> 01:41:16,553
Shall I keep it in the car?
- Bush will hire you to kill Osama

1262
01:41:16,631 --> 01:41:20,499
It's in the car.
- You'll be the greatest villain

1263
01:41:20,568 --> 01:41:24,834
Start counting, Soprano.
Five, four...

1264
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:27,508
three, two... blast!

1265
01:41:44,926 --> 01:41:47,793
I like it. I like it!

1266
01:41:49,864 --> 01:41:54,528
Those three defective pieces turned
out to be very brave. I like it

1267
01:41:56,137 --> 01:42:01,541
You went to blow them up and got
yourself blown up instead. I like it

1268
01:42:02,877 --> 01:42:06,540
I like it. Soprano likes it

1269
01:42:07,615 --> 01:42:11,551
Hello, Mafia? Yes, Mafia

1270
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:16,553
Your consignment will
leave in few days

1271
01:42:34,242 --> 01:42:35,573
Hello, God

1272
01:42:35,977 --> 01:42:39,845
From angry young men to miserable
mothers...

1273
01:42:39,914 --> 01:42:41,848
...everyone prayed for something

1274
01:42:41,916 --> 01:42:46,979
And You answered their prayers. For
the first time, I seek something

1275
01:42:47,055 --> 01:42:52,857
God, please give me some girls.
Please God, fill up my consignment

1276
01:42:52,927 --> 01:42:56,124
Please God, I'm pleading You

1277
01:42:56,197 --> 01:43:02,602
Give me some girls, God

1278
01:43:04,139 --> 01:43:07,597
I'm Bijlee, a fisherwoman.
- So?

1279
01:43:08,276 --> 01:43:13,145
So, I've come to tell you
that you are very beautiful

1280
01:43:13,948 --> 01:43:18,612
And what do they say? Yes,
hot. You are very hot

1281
01:43:18,953 --> 01:43:25,085
You can find anyone. But there's
only one for me. Tom

1282
01:43:25,894 --> 01:43:29,091
Look, Harry will suit you fine

1283
01:43:29,164 --> 01:43:32,622
As for Dipak, he's nice too

1284
01:43:33,301 --> 01:43:37,169
But please spare Tom.
- Who are you talking about?

1285
01:43:37,305 --> 01:43:42,106
Damn! Tom Dick and Harry who
work in your restaurant

1286
01:43:42,977 --> 01:43:47,846
Tom is mine.
- What rubbish!

1287
01:43:48,983 --> 01:43:55,650
It's true. In your love, he left
everything and joined your restaurant

1288
01:43:55,723 --> 01:44:00,990
He's been cleaning, sweeping and
doing dishes. He's crazy for you

1289
01:44:01,262 --> 01:44:06,256
But I don't love him.
- Really? Then go and tell them

1290
01:44:06,401 --> 01:44:10,804
So that they are exorcised of
your love and I'll find my Tom

1291
01:44:11,940 --> 01:44:16,673
I'll leave now. You must do
this job, it's urgent. Bye

1292
01:44:20,081 --> 01:44:23,016
You guys love me, eh?

1293
01:44:25,954 --> 01:44:29,151
Yes, of course. We are
in love with you

1294
01:44:29,357 --> 01:44:34,158
Especially, me. A lot
more than others

1295
01:44:34,295 --> 01:44:37,696
But we have no idea who
you love. Tell us...

1296
01:44:37,765 --> 01:44:41,701
who is the fortunate one
amongst us? - It's me

1297
01:44:41,769 --> 01:44:43,703
Tell me, baby.
- Shut up

1298
01:44:44,305 --> 01:44:48,833
You ought to be ashamed of your
actions. I'm trying to help you guys

1299
01:44:48,910 --> 01:44:52,971
How could you malign me?
- But it's not our fault

1300
01:44:53,047 --> 01:44:58,713
You are so nice, so caring,
that all of us fell for you

1301
01:44:58,987 --> 01:45:02,718
Actually, we joined
the restaurant...

1302
01:45:02,790 --> 01:45:04,724
only to stay close to you

1303
01:45:05,059 --> 01:45:07,994
How easily you guys
poured your heart out

1304
01:45:08,796 --> 01:45:11,731
You didn't even care to think
that it could hurt me

1305
01:45:12,867 --> 01:45:15,734
I empathize with you guys,
I don't love you

1306
01:45:15,803 --> 01:45:18,135
We are just friends. Understand?

1307
01:45:20,341 --> 01:45:24,277
As for the misgivings in your
heart, chuck them out

1308
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:29,743
One who messes with love,
ruins himself

1309
01:45:30,084 --> 01:45:35,078
Your words make me feel that
you've been betrayed in love

1310
01:45:35,156 --> 01:45:37,750
That's my personal problem.
Understood?

1311
01:45:40,361 --> 01:45:43,762
Now that we are good friends...

1312
01:45:43,831 --> 01:45:47,096
you have to tell us about him

1313
01:45:47,435 --> 01:45:50,962
Your problem is our problem now

1314
01:45:53,107 --> 01:45:57,771
There was someone in
my life whom I loved

1315
01:45:58,379 --> 01:46:02,372
Due to some misunderstandings,
we parted ways

1316
01:46:02,850 --> 01:46:07,787
Just watch. We will dispel the
misunderstandings in a trice

1317
01:46:09,057 --> 01:46:11,787
Tell us, where does he live?

1318
01:46:11,859 --> 01:46:15,454
I don't want to meet him, I
don't want to face him either

1319
01:46:15,797 --> 01:46:18,789
Get another thing clear.
I don't want to...

1320
01:46:18,866 --> 01:46:21,801
...hear anything about
love here anymore

1321
01:46:21,869 --> 01:46:22,995
Understand?

1322
01:46:27,875 --> 01:46:31,072
What happened? Tell me

1323
01:46:47,895 --> 01:46:50,090
Good afternoon, sir.
- Hey Celina

1324
01:46:53,501 --> 01:46:56,368
What news? You look disturbed?

1325
01:46:56,437 --> 01:47:00,840
I'm tired of this threesome. I gave
them jobs at the hotel because...

1326
01:47:00,908 --> 01:47:04,844
I expected the kidnappers to come
for them and then I'd arrest them

1327
01:47:04,912 --> 01:47:08,848
But now they're in love with me.
- Look Celina,

1328
01:47:08,916 --> 01:47:12,852
you're a police officer
and you're on duty...

1329
01:47:13,187 --> 01:47:16,384
...I hoped to hear positive news

1330
01:47:16,457 --> 01:47:18,186
Sir, I think I've got them

1331
01:47:18,326 --> 01:47:21,853
An informer is tipping me
off about their whereabouts

1332
01:47:21,929 --> 01:47:24,329
I think we can raid them tonight

1333
01:47:24,399 --> 01:47:26,060
You just be ready
with the force, sir

1334
01:47:27,135 --> 01:47:29,069
So what was the big mistake?

1335
01:47:30,204 --> 01:47:33,867
All three of us have hurt Celina,

1336
01:47:34,208 --> 01:47:38,872
unknowingly, we hurt
her feelings, deeply

1337
01:47:40,281 --> 01:47:46,880
Now, that you shouldn't have done.
In matters of the heart, she is sad

1338
01:47:47,488 --> 01:47:52,551
That's why, to keep herself busy,
she re-started my restaurant

1339
01:47:53,227 --> 01:47:55,161
Now you've gone and hurt her?

1340
01:47:56,364 --> 01:48:03,167
I know and that's why, on
behalf of all of us...

1341
01:48:03,237 --> 01:48:05,102
I'm here to apologize

1342
01:48:06,174 --> 01:48:09,905
She isn't at home right now

1343
01:48:12,113 --> 01:48:14,172
She has come!
- Yes, I think Celina has come

1344
01:48:14,248 --> 01:48:15,442
I'll be back

1345
01:48:17,251 --> 01:48:22,188
Celina must forgive all three
of us and how can she refuse...

1346
01:48:22,256 --> 01:48:24,918
I'll beg at her hands
and feet and everything

1347
01:48:26,994 --> 01:48:32,933
Has Celina arrived? - Not Celina,
instead a bouquet for her

1348
01:48:35,203 --> 01:48:40,539
Must be from her boyfriend?
- Celina knows the answer best

1349
01:48:40,608 --> 01:48:42,132
One minute, the phone

1350
01:48:47,081 --> 01:48:51,950
Lovely bouquet,

1351
01:48:52,019 --> 01:48:56,956
the fragrance is enticing,
the boyfriend, must be

1352
01:48:59,026 --> 01:49:01,620
What's this, an envelope?

1353
01:49:02,296 --> 01:49:07,962
The boyfriend's whereabouts
must be inside, this is fun!

1354
01:49:10,238 --> 01:49:12,229
You may have procured
the boyfriend's address

1355
01:49:12,573 --> 01:49:14,973
But will Celina be willing
to return to him?

1356
01:49:16,043 --> 01:49:20,309
If we can eradicate the
misunderstandings between them...

1357
01:49:20,381 --> 01:49:23,179
the lovers may re-unite

1358
01:49:25,319 --> 01:49:28,584
Ask him how

1359
01:49:29,390 --> 01:49:30,982
How?

1360
01:49:33,060 --> 01:49:39,522
Our job is done, if somehow, we
can pitch them face to face

1361
01:49:40,134 --> 01:49:45,003
But how? Celina doesn't
even want to see his face

1362
01:49:46,274 --> 01:49:49,072
Think, think, how to take Celina...

1363
01:49:49,143 --> 01:49:51,008
What?
- One minute

1364
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:55,547
One minute, but what can
he achieve in a minute?

1365
01:50:01,355 --> 01:50:05,553
You mean we put Celina inside
a bottle and we take her along

1366
01:50:06,294 --> 01:50:11,231
Silly, small bottle-big Celina,
won't fit each other

1367
01:50:11,299 --> 01:50:13,028
Shut up, shut up, shut up

1368
01:50:13,367 --> 01:50:16,029
Oh I see, we hit her on
the head with a bottle,

1369
01:50:16,103 --> 01:50:18,037
we knock her out and
then we take her...

1370
01:50:18,105 --> 01:50:21,040
...third-rate idea, but worth a try

1371
01:50:22,510 --> 01:50:26,037
Tea... brother of tea... coffee?

1372
01:50:28,115 --> 01:50:30,049
Lace her coffee

1373
01:50:30,117 --> 01:50:32,051
She drinks,

1374
01:50:32,119 --> 01:50:33,177
she dies?

1375
01:50:33,254 --> 01:50:38,055
No... is knocked out of her
senses? Wonderful idea

1376
01:50:46,667 --> 01:50:50,068
When did this bouquet arrive?
- A while ago

1377
01:50:50,204 --> 01:50:52,069
But what are you looking
for inside?

1378
01:50:52,406 --> 01:50:54,340
There was to have been an envelope...

1379
01:50:54,408 --> 01:50:57,070
...- There was an envelope,
must be there

1380
01:50:57,678 --> 01:51:01,079
Were there any callers at home?
- Yes, Dipak came

1381
01:51:03,150 --> 01:51:04,344
Dipak...

1382
01:51:06,153 --> 01:51:11,420
Dipak... Dipak... Dipak...
- Yes?

1383
01:51:11,492 --> 01:51:13,551
Did you take an envelope
from the bouquet

1384
01:51:13,628 --> 01:51:17,086
Envelope? Yes Tom,
pass the envelope

1385
01:51:19,433 --> 01:51:21,560
What childishness is this,
Tom? Give me that envelope

1386
01:51:21,636 --> 01:51:25,436
Over coffee, as if
you've forgiven us

1387
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:28,108
No coffee

1388
01:51:28,175 --> 01:51:30,166
Do you understand, I want
the bloody card

1389
01:51:30,244 --> 01:51:33,179
Instant coffee, happens instantly.
- What childishness is this?

1390
01:51:33,247 --> 01:51:35,442
Coffee, please.
- I don't want coffee

1391
01:51:35,516 --> 01:51:38,110
Drink it up, we're
drinking coffee too

1392
01:51:44,792 --> 01:51:49,126
Give me the card, I said give
me the card - Okay, take it

1393
01:52:07,815 --> 01:52:11,683
Sir, the address... I...

1394
01:52:12,687 --> 01:52:16,145
Swooned?
- Yes

1395
01:52:16,223 --> 01:52:18,157
What planning!

1396
01:52:30,504 --> 01:52:37,171
The blind boy has come on crutches,
this time, they have a girl too

1397
01:52:42,650 --> 01:52:44,174
Go away

1398
01:52:57,331 --> 01:53:01,529
Gentlemen, we were
rehearsing a drama

1399
01:53:02,470 --> 01:53:04,199
What can I do for you?

1400
01:53:05,272 --> 01:53:07,206
I've brought your girlfriend to you

1401
01:53:10,811 --> 01:53:13,746
She was not willing to come,
so we have to dope her

1402
01:53:13,814 --> 01:53:18,217
You never give up true
love over quarrels

1403
01:53:18,352 --> 01:53:24,222
You ought to forgive her and also
apologize to her when she comes to

1404
01:53:24,291 --> 01:53:29,228
You've no idea how nice-soft
and-pretty a girlfriend you have

1405
01:53:29,563 --> 01:53:33,226
How did come to know that
she is my girlfriend?

1406
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:35,564
Can true love ever be hidden, sir?

1407
01:53:35,636 --> 01:53:39,629
I've been in love too and for
someone who is truly in love,

1408
01:53:39,707 --> 01:53:42,437
what better a gift?

1409
01:53:43,310 --> 01:53:46,768
I am... so grateful to you!

1410
01:53:48,382 --> 01:53:53,513
In re-uniting parted lovers,
you've achieved...

1411
01:53:53,587 --> 01:53:57,250
what Sharukh Khan did
in the movie Koyla

1412
01:53:57,591 --> 01:54:01,322
what Akshay Kumar did in the
movie Dil To Pagal Hai

1413
01:54:01,395 --> 01:54:04,455
what Salman Khan did in the
movie Kuch Kuch Hota Hai

1414
01:54:04,532 --> 01:54:11,335
Thank you! In returning my beloved
to me, you have done a great job

1415
01:54:11,405 --> 01:54:16,809
Please, do come for my wedding.
I'll send you invitation cards

1416
01:54:16,877 --> 01:54:20,278
Take care of her.
- Only after you leave?

1417
01:54:20,614 --> 01:54:22,275
So now, we depart

1418
01:54:22,349 --> 01:54:25,284
Yes, go on...
- No, we won't eat anything

1419
01:54:25,352 --> 01:54:27,877
We're leaving.
- Get going

1420
01:54:27,955 --> 01:54:30,287
Bring that along too.

1421
01:54:49,643 --> 01:54:51,304
Mission complete

1422
01:54:52,379 --> 01:54:56,315
The consignment walks
straight up to us

1423
01:54:58,519 --> 01:55:01,317
We're going to have a party

1424
01:55:01,455 --> 01:55:05,789
And the theme will Bollywood

1425
01:55:07,795 --> 01:55:13,324
Mumbai Police has met with some
success in the kidnappings' case

1426
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:16,528
Look, that bald guy on TV

1427
01:55:16,604 --> 01:55:21,871
The Mumbai Police has found the gang,
and this is gang-leader Soprano

1428
01:55:21,942 --> 01:55:24,342
Soprano is wanted in
several countries

1429
01:55:24,678 --> 01:55:29,672
He must be some bigshot, announcing
his wedding on TV

1430
01:55:31,619 --> 01:55:34,952
That guy... the one who catches?

1431
01:55:35,489 --> 01:55:37,616
Kidnapper? He is a kidnapper?

1432
01:55:37,691 --> 01:55:41,354
Above the kidnapper? What
can that be? Oh... boss!

1433
01:55:42,496 --> 01:55:45,363
Celina's boyfriend is
the kidnappers' boss?

1434
01:56:20,868 --> 01:56:22,859
Celina! Where are you?

1435
01:56:22,937 --> 01:56:25,929
Sir, I'm in this place...
- Which place?

1436
01:56:26,607 --> 01:56:31,738
Where the girls are being held.
- Give me the address

1437
01:56:31,812 --> 01:56:34,406
Contact Tom, Dick and Harry

1438
01:56:34,481 --> 01:56:37,006
They are the ones who brought
me here, they know this place

1439
01:56:39,486 --> 01:56:45,686
Mistake... I've committed
a grave mistake

1440
01:56:46,493 --> 01:56:47,619
Why are you hitting him?

1441
01:56:47,695 --> 01:56:49,686
He... is... at fault?

1442
01:56:49,763 --> 01:56:51,424
Yes! All his fault. Damn you!

1443
01:56:51,498 --> 01:56:58,495
The day he came to my house and
bent down for me, I knew he's an ass

1444
01:56:58,572 --> 01:57:00,972
Had I known that the
fuse in his brains...

1445
01:57:01,041 --> 01:57:03,100
...is blown just like in his eyes...

1446
01:57:03,177 --> 01:57:05,441
I wouldn't have given him
a place to live in my house

1447
01:57:05,512 --> 01:57:07,776
Why are you screaming
at him, whatever...

1448
01:57:07,848 --> 01:57:10,908
...he did, he did it
out of love, right?

1449
01:57:10,985 --> 01:57:13,453
One minute lady, one minute

1450
01:57:13,787 --> 01:57:16,517
Now let me think, what's to be done

1451
01:57:16,590 --> 01:57:18,455
No!
- Don't!

1452
01:57:18,525 --> 01:57:20,459
What happened? He?

1453
01:57:20,527 --> 01:57:22,461
Is thinking of thinking?

1454
01:57:22,529 --> 01:57:23,928
He's talking about thinking?
- Yes

1455
01:57:23,998 --> 01:57:26,466
No! Uncle, whatever else
you do in life...

1456
01:57:26,533 --> 01:57:28,467
...don't think of thinking, please

1457
01:57:28,535 --> 01:57:30,662
Leave that to us, please.
- Okay

1458
01:57:32,806 --> 01:57:41,874
What do we do now? I haven't a clue

1459
01:57:41,949 --> 01:57:44,474
At this rate, while we're thinking,
they'll be celebrating

1460
01:57:44,818 --> 01:57:50,950
Got to work out a plan,
got to save Celina

1461
01:57:51,959 --> 01:57:54,484
Tom... come along, quick

1462
01:57:54,762 --> 01:57:58,163
If they are celebrating...

1463
01:58:00,834 --> 01:58:02,961
if they are celebrating...

1464
01:58:03,771 --> 01:58:11,507
why don't we join the celebrations
? Idea! Where are they gone?

1465
01:58:12,579 --> 01:58:17,778
What I must do to get to you

1466
01:58:17,851 --> 01:58:23,517
What I must do to get to you

1467
01:58:28,595 --> 01:58:33,862
What I must do to get to you

1468
01:58:33,934 --> 01:58:39,531
What I must do to get to you

1469
01:58:49,616 --> 01:58:55,145
What I must do to get to you

1470
01:58:55,222 --> 01:58:57,747
Oh what things I must do,
to get to you...

1471
01:58:57,825 --> 01:59:00,555
what I must do to get to you

1472
01:59:00,627 --> 01:59:03,562
Oh what things I must do,
to get to you...

1473
01:59:03,630 --> 01:59:06,155
what I must do to get to you

1474
01:59:06,300 --> 01:59:17,575
Your gait drives me crazy,
blows my mind, O 'my love

1475
01:59:17,911 --> 01:59:23,178
What I must do to get to you

1476
01:59:23,317 --> 01:59:28,914
What I must do to get to you

1477
01:59:29,056 --> 01:59:40,593
Your gait drives me crazy,
blows my mind, O 'my love

1478
01:59:40,667 --> 01:59:45,934
What I must do to get to you

1479
02:00:12,900 --> 02:00:17,963
What I must do to get to you

1480
02:00:18,705 --> 02:00:21,037
I'm restless,

1481
02:00:21,108 --> 02:00:23,633
love me

1482
02:00:23,710 --> 02:00:26,645
Forget the world,

1483
02:00:26,713 --> 02:00:28,977
for love, live or die

1484
02:00:29,049 --> 02:00:34,646
What I must do to get to you

1485
02:00:34,721 --> 02:00:39,920
A wild ecstasy, swinging in my
heart, a strange elation is born

1486
02:00:39,993 --> 02:00:44,987
I cannot bear the pangs of solitude

1487
02:00:45,132 --> 02:00:56,669
Those words of yours, raise such
hopes, makes me lovelorn, O'my love

1488
02:00:56,743 --> 02:01:02,682
What I must do to get to you

1489
02:01:29,243 --> 02:01:34,704
Love's a magic that makes
every heart throb

1490
02:01:34,781 --> 02:01:39,718
You can't stop that, no
matter what you want

1491
02:01:39,786 --> 02:01:44,723
What I must do to get to you

1492
02:01:45,058 --> 02:01:50,724
In love's season, you're
left restless

1493
02:01:50,797 --> 02:01:55,860
It's murderous, it can
kill in cold blood

1494
02:01:55,936 --> 02:02:01,272
Then let's dance together,
give in to the throbbing,

1495
02:02:01,341 --> 02:02:07,075
let's burn ourselves and set
the world on fire, O'my love

1496
02:02:07,347 --> 02:02:12,751
What I must do to get to you

1497
02:02:12,819 --> 02:02:18,086
What I must do to get to you

1498
02:02:18,158 --> 02:02:23,755
What I must do to get to you

1499
02:02:28,835 --> 02:02:30,769
Fantastic!

1500
02:02:32,105 --> 02:02:33,766
Mind-blowing

1501
02:02:35,108 --> 02:02:39,101
You've turned my party
into something great

1502
02:02:39,179 --> 02:02:40,771
I love it

1503
02:02:43,850 --> 02:02:45,784
Hey beautiful

1504
02:02:46,853 --> 02:02:49,947
You are so pretty, you
ought to have come...

1505
02:02:50,023 --> 02:02:51,786
...when I was scoring half century

1506
02:02:52,859 --> 02:02:54,793
Anthony...

1507
02:02:54,861 --> 02:02:55,953
fantastic

1508
02:02:57,130 --> 02:02:58,791
Mr. Pandey,

1509
02:02:58,966 --> 02:03:00,797
very good

1510
02:03:01,969 --> 02:03:03,800
Mr. Khan,

1511
02:03:03,870 --> 02:03:05,303
lovely

1512
02:03:05,372 --> 02:03:06,805
How do you do?

1513
02:03:08,976 --> 02:03:10,807
Nice meeting you

1514
02:03:13,880 --> 02:03:16,815
Blind man's bluff, I can
see through it all

1515
02:03:17,884 --> 02:03:19,818
Get them all.
- Get them?

1516
02:03:19,987 --> 02:03:23,821
My hero, my hero, come, hold me!

1517
02:03:30,897 --> 02:03:32,831
What do I look like to you? (e0

1518
02:03:32,899 --> 02:03:35,834
Missing a light bulb somewhere?

1519
02:03:36,903 --> 02:03:42,842
What do you take me for,
a stupid bald, idiot?

1520
02:03:44,911 --> 02:03:47,846
I was brought up on Bollywood films

1521
02:03:47,914 --> 02:03:53,853
The mistakes of Shakal-Mogambo-Gabbar
are never to be mine

1522
02:03:54,921 --> 02:03:57,856
Soprano is an international villain

1523
02:03:58,925 --> 02:04:05,854
You think you can use a 70s
climax to nab me... Soprano?

1524
02:04:06,933 --> 02:04:09,026
If you have to catch Soprano,
think international...

1525
02:04:09,102 --> 02:04:12,868
...think big, think global

1526
02:04:16,943 --> 02:04:19,878
Now show to me all
their real faces...

1527
02:04:20,213 --> 02:04:21,874
...show me their faces

1528
02:04:21,948 --> 02:04:24,883
I'm a Sikh for real!
- Sorry

1529
02:04:26,053 --> 02:04:27,884
What are you doing?

1530
02:04:28,955 --> 02:04:30,388
What's happening?

1531
02:04:31,391 --> 02:04:33,882
It's running? I'll fix it myself

1532
02:04:48,975 --> 02:04:50,408
Girl friend?

1533
02:04:50,477 --> 02:04:54,914
Ah! Love to love you baby

1534
02:05:02,255 --> 02:05:07,249
With the two of you, Soprano will
make six bald babies each

1535
02:05:07,327 --> 02:05:11,093
You defective pieces will be bashed
up so badly by my men...

1536
02:05:11,164 --> 02:05:13,928
You defective pieces will be bashed
up so badly by my men...

1537
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,935
...will ever again try to
even stare at Soprano

1538
02:05:20,006 --> 02:05:23,942
And inside Soprano's den
the police never arrives

1539
02:05:25,112 --> 02:05:29,276
Come on babies, time to make
babies, the police isn't coming

1540
02:05:29,349 --> 02:05:30,941
We have arrived!

1541
02:05:32,119 --> 02:05:34,952
Take off your glasses, see for
yourself the police have come

1542
02:05:35,021 --> 02:05:38,957
And this time, we're on time.
Before the climax ensues

1543
02:05:39,025 --> 02:05:43,291
P.K. Waghmare gives goons
like you such a bashing,

1544
02:05:43,363 --> 02:05:46,958
that you'll live in fear of
being born again on earth.

1545
02:05:47,033 --> 02:05:48,967
Catch the scoundrels

1546
02:05:54,040 --> 02:05:55,132
Hands off

1547
02:05:55,208 --> 02:05:56,971
Good job, officer

1548
02:05:57,043 --> 02:05:58,977
What's going on

1549
02:05:59,146 --> 02:06:01,307
Officer?
- Yes, officer in disguise

1550
02:06:01,381 --> 02:06:03,144
Planted by me

1551
02:06:03,216 --> 02:06:06,982
For villains like you, such
officers are needed

1552
02:06:07,053 --> 02:06:08,145
Police officer?
- No!

1553
02:06:08,221 --> 02:06:10,985
Celina is a police officer?
- Celina is a police officer

1554
02:06:11,057 --> 02:06:14,993
Soprano, have you lost your
nuts? Where's your gun?

1555
02:06:16,062 --> 02:06:20,499
The boss never packs a gun,
the pocket dog does

1556
02:06:20,567 --> 02:06:22,000
Your commissioner wears one?

1557
02:06:22,068 --> 02:06:24,002
You mean to say, I am a pocket dog?

1558
02:06:25,071 --> 02:06:26,504
Worse than that

1559
02:06:27,340 --> 02:06:29,001
Let go

1560
02:06:32,078 --> 02:06:33,511
Leave it

1561
02:06:38,618 --> 02:06:40,017
Let go, you bald swine

1562
02:06:45,525 --> 02:06:47,015
Took one of your men

1563
02:06:50,096 --> 02:06:52,030
Does he know how to use a gun?

1564
02:06:53,533 --> 02:06:55,023
One down on your side

1565
02:06:55,368 --> 02:06:57,029
Now's your turn

1566
02:06:58,104 --> 02:07:00,038
Soprano hits police

1567
02:07:04,644 --> 02:07:08,045
No police... get out

1568
02:07:09,649 --> 02:07:11,640
No one must escape

1569
02:07:11,718 --> 02:07:15,051
And dash the hard discs
of those defective pieces

1570
02:07:15,121 --> 02:07:16,383
One minute

1571
02:07:29,236 --> 02:07:30,567
Take me on

1572
02:07:42,148 --> 02:07:44,082
You're in a friend's arms,
kick at 3 o'clock

1573
02:07:44,251 --> 02:07:46,082
9 o'clock

1574
02:07:46,253 --> 02:07:48,414
Nine and three... hit

1575
02:07:48,488 --> 02:07:49,580
Mind-blowing

1576
02:07:49,656 --> 02:07:51,089
3 o'clock up ahead

1577
02:07:53,159 --> 02:07:58,096
One-two... one-two

1578
02:07:58,431 --> 02:08:00,092
What was that?
- Alarm clock

1579
02:08:12,178 --> 02:08:17,115
You'll hit a girl?
No... I knew that

1580
02:08:17,183 --> 02:08:19,117
You're my cute boy

1581
02:08:19,185 --> 02:08:21,119
Filth, rogue

1582
02:08:21,187 --> 02:08:23,121
Dog, die

1583
02:08:23,189 --> 02:08:25,123
Two more slaps for you

1584
02:08:30,463 --> 02:08:32,124
How cute

1585
02:08:32,198 --> 02:08:35,133
Take that... and that

1586
02:08:48,315 --> 02:08:51,148
Come... let me save you... come...

1587
02:09:00,226 --> 02:09:04,162
Soprano's lesson number
one. Die laughing

1588
02:09:12,505 --> 02:09:15,167
Why are you dancing?
You've made friends?

1589
02:09:15,342 --> 02:09:16,673
Join the dance

1590
02:09:19,346 --> 02:09:20,677
Hit!

1591
02:09:22,349 --> 02:09:24,180
Where?
- Hit

1592
02:09:25,352 --> 02:09:27,513
Why are you hitting Harry?

1593
02:09:27,587 --> 02:09:30,181
We're friends now, keep a memento

1594
02:09:31,524 --> 02:09:33,185
When did we make friends?

1595
02:09:42,869 --> 02:09:44,200
Three apes?

1596
02:09:44,270 --> 02:09:45,532
Ape one

1597
02:09:45,605 --> 02:09:46,697
Number two

1598
02:09:47,273 --> 02:09:48,706
And third

1599
02:09:50,810 --> 02:09:55,213
Look what your bald boss is coming
to, you'll end up like him too

1600
02:09:55,281 --> 02:09:56,373
Run

1601
02:09:56,449 --> 02:09:59,213
Time out... Soprano

1602
02:10:03,289 --> 02:10:04,722
Come on Soprano

1603
02:10:06,826 --> 02:10:09,226
Sorry my mistake, but how would
I know, you were dancing with him

1604
02:10:11,898 --> 02:10:14,230
Goodness, what have I gotten into?

1605
02:10:14,300 --> 02:10:17,235
Got you! I'm not leaving you

1606
02:10:17,303 --> 02:10:21,239
Filth! You grab a girl from behind
? Just you wait, I'll show you

1607
02:10:22,308 --> 02:10:25,243
Come on now

1608
02:10:25,412 --> 02:10:30,247
What are you staring at?
- Silicon valley

1609
02:10:30,316 --> 02:10:32,250
Curse your mother

1610
02:10:32,419 --> 02:10:34,250
It's for real

1611
02:10:36,756 --> 02:10:39,247
What makes you laugh?

1612
02:10:39,325 --> 02:10:41,259
Soprano's rule number two

1613
02:10:41,327 --> 02:10:45,263
Getting bashed by a woman
is a privilege of sorts

1614
02:10:45,331 --> 02:10:47,265
I'll give you some

1615
02:10:52,605 --> 02:10:56,268
Are you okay?
- Darling, I always knew...

1616
02:10:56,443 --> 02:10:59,606
someday you'll come to my rescue!
- Now let's eat the fish

1617
02:11:15,628 --> 02:11:20,622
He's here to save you, not for fun,
get going, go home quick

1618
02:11:20,700 --> 02:11:26,297
Sexy, what's going on here and what
are you up to? Go and fight

1619
02:11:26,639 --> 02:11:28,300
Soprano is coming

1620
02:11:28,374 --> 02:11:32,310
Get my helicopter, Soprano's
helicopter

1621
02:11:32,645 --> 02:11:35,637
Curse your mother! I'll show
you... - What language! Shut up

1622
02:11:35,715 --> 02:11:38,309
Girls, stay back.
- You locked up the girls?

1623
02:11:39,385 --> 02:11:41,319
All the girls are out? Lock them up

1624
02:11:46,659 --> 02:11:49,321
Girls, to fight with Soprano?

1625
02:11:51,397 --> 02:11:55,333
Girls belong in Soprano's bed

1626
02:11:55,935 --> 02:11:59,336
Soprano buys them and sells them

1627
02:11:59,405 --> 02:12:04,342
Women aren't chattel
for buying-selling

1628
02:12:04,410 --> 02:12:07,345
I'll teach you what women are

1629
02:12:13,686 --> 02:12:17,349
Nice chair!
- Get out of Soprano's throne

1630
02:12:17,423 --> 02:12:19,357
You want me to get
out and show you?

1631
02:12:28,535 --> 02:12:30,366
You're back?

1632
02:12:32,705 --> 02:12:34,366
Get out of it, you bald fool

1633
02:12:39,712 --> 02:12:46,379
God! Soprano is defeated?

1634
02:12:46,452 --> 02:12:52,391
The mistakes of Shakal-Mogambo-Gabbar
were never mine

1635
02:12:52,458 --> 02:12:56,394
Still, a threesome
blind-mute-and-deaf defeated me?

1636
02:12:56,462 --> 02:13:00,398
Some Tom-Dick-and-Harry
defeated Soprano

1637
02:13:01,734 --> 02:13:04,396
Shame on me

1638
02:13:04,904 --> 02:13:07,395
Kill me, somebody shoot me

1639
02:13:07,473 --> 02:13:11,409
Someone, give me a bullet, please

1640
02:13:12,579 --> 02:13:14,410
Get a hold on him, he has gone mad

1641
02:13:14,581 --> 02:13:16,913
Move it everyone

1642
02:13:16,983 --> 02:13:21,420
Girls, you're free to go home

1643
02:13:21,487 --> 02:13:23,421
Clear out, everyone

1644
02:13:23,489 --> 02:13:25,423
Not, I'm not telling you to go away

1645
02:13:25,491 --> 02:13:28,426
We're off, please stay on a while

1646
02:13:30,496 --> 02:13:35,433
Whom to choose?

1647
02:13:35,602 --> 02:13:39,436
The first, second or third?

1648
02:13:39,939 --> 02:13:46,435
Whom to choose?

1649
02:13:51,517 --> 02:13:53,451
Hey Bijli...
- Hey, when did you come?

1650
02:13:53,519 --> 02:13:55,453
Send a current through me,

1651
02:13:56,522 --> 02:13:57,784
shock me

1652
02:13:59,792 --> 02:14:02,454
Flowers, for you

1653
02:14:06,799 --> 02:14:12,465
What... gives... today...
you are in love with me?

1654
02:14:12,538 --> 02:14:16,474
Today I have come to talk
to you about romance

1655
02:14:16,542 --> 02:14:20,478
I have come to propose to you, love

1656
02:14:24,651 --> 02:14:26,482
What are you thinking?

1657
02:14:26,819 --> 02:14:32,485
Whom... am I... to choose?

1658
02:14:32,558 --> 02:14:33,991
Meaning?

1659
02:14:34,060 --> 02:14:41,489
Meaning, two more fish
are now in my net

1660
02:14:42,669 --> 02:14:48,505
There are two others in your life?
Who are they? Rotten fish!

1661
02:14:48,841 --> 02:14:51,503
There they are, my cute boys.
