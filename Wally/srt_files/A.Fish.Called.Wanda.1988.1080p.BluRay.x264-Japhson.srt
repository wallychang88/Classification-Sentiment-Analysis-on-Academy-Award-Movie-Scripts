1
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:30,404
And on that point,
members of the jury, I rest my case.

2
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,585
Hello, Wanda.

3
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:41,577
- Hi, Ken.
- Hello, W-W-Wanda.

4
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:45,914
Ken... this is Otto.

5
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,250
Hello. Wanda's told me a lot about you.

6
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,252
Hey! Great fish!

7
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,088
A little squeeze of lemon,
some tartare sauce, perfect!

8
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,508
George back yet?

9
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,887
No. He had to g-g-go to the b-b-b...

10
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,476
What?

11
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,855
That's quite a stutter
you've got there, Ken.

12
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:14,610
It's all right, it doesn't bother me.
So George needs a weapons man, eh?

13
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,196
A cup of tea, Ken?

14
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,947
Y-y-y...

15
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,116
Yeah. He'd like one.

16
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,494
I had a good friend in the CIA
had a stutter. Cost him his life.

17
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,083
Hi, George.

18
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,171
Hello, George. Get you a Scotch?

19
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,006
Yeah.

20
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,593
George... this is Otto.

21
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,181
So, you're Wanda's brother.

22
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,976
It's good to be here, George.
England is a fine country.

23
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,979
She tell you what we need?

24
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,157
Something like that?

25
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,577
Something like that.

26
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,623
Hello, Wendy.

27
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,460
Had a good day?

28
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,713
I spend the morning trying
to get a waste-disposal man,

29
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:20,634
have lunch with Marjorie, who kept
complaining about her husband,

30
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,512
then I have to play
three rubbers with Philippa.

31
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,515
And now Sanderson's
have sent the wrong flowers.

32
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,350
Oh, no!

33
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,438
- Would you like some tea?
- Yes.

34
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,400
I won the case.

35
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,860
This is my first moment
of peace all day.

36
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,494
- Hello, Portia. How was the show?
- Awful. I've got to have a new horse.

37
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,622
- I thought you liked Phantom.
- He's not fit for dog meat.

38
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,376
- Can I change him? It won't cost much.
- Oughtn't we to ask...

39
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,546
I thought you were making tea, Archie.
I'd better do it.

40
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,716
- Let me do it.
- No, I'll do it!

41
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,931
- I won the case.
- Oh! Now this is cracked.

42
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,853
They're worth about 100,000 each.

43
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:17,357
There are 135 of them.
That makes 13 millions, my friends.

44
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,360
- Dollars or pounds?
- Pounds, pet.

45
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,113
This is the big one. So...

46
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,116
OK.

47
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,035
Yeah.

48
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,704
Otto?

49
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,956
- Yes?
- OK?

50
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,959
- What?
- The plan.

51
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,920
Yeah. Great. No problem.

52
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,590
What was the middle thing,
about the police?

53
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,552
We don't meet up
at Heathrow until Tuesday...

54
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,764
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I haven't finished yet.

55
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:52,934
Because the police will watch
all the airports for 72 hours.

56
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,020
I know. I know.

57
00:05:56,272 --> 00:06:00,609
Do you want m-m-me to g-g-get a b-b-big

58
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:04,279
c-c-car?

59
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,324
Yes, Ken. A limo, OK?

60
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,118
And put diplomatic plates on it, right?

61
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,245
What if he has to speak
in the break-in?

62
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,664
Nobody says anything during
a break-in.

63
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:17,459
It's OK, Otto. Ken's good.

64
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:22,089
So next week we won't
have to look for work.

65
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,592
And it won't have to look for us.

66
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,844
Oscar Wilde.

67
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:36,520
You really like animals, don't you, Ken?
What's the attraction?

68
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:42,150
Because you can t-t-trust them,
and they don't sh-sh-sh...

69
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,821
- Shit on you?
- Show off all the time.

70
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:51,076
Know what Nietzsche said about them?
He said they were God's second blunder.

71
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,744
Bye, sis.

72
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:57,165
Well, you t-tell him from me
that I-I-I...

73
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,000
Bye, George.

74
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,795
If you talk to Mom, tell her I said hi.

75
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,964
- OK.
- Don't let him touch you.

76
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,882
One more day, we're together.

77
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:13,265
I'm sorry about my brother, Ken.
I know he's insensitive.

78
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:17,894
He's had a hard life.
Dad used to beat him up.

79
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,150
Good.

80
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,655
Anybody moves
and you're dead!

81
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,480
Look where you're going! Chauvinist pig!

82
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,693
Really! People here just think
they own the pavement!

83
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:00,890
That was fun. I love robbing the
English. They're so polite.

84
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,018
- The d-d-d...
- What is it, Ken?

85
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,770
- The dog!
- We didn't hit the dog, Ken. It's OK.

86
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,772
$20 million,
he worried about an insect.

87
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,357
It's not an-an-an...

88
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,026
Stutter's not getting any better, is it?

89
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,444
Shut up!

90
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,696
Shut up!

91
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,579
Ken?

92
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,540
Bye.

93
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,615
- Let's split.
- Heathrow, Tuesday.

94
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,993
- Lie low. No celebrating.
- No celebrating?

95
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,664
- See you in a couple of hours.
- OK. Bye.

96
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,423
- To 20 million.
- To a job well done.

97
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,716
To us.

98
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,719
To the best
brother-and-sister team since...

99
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,887
Romeo and Juliet?

100
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:07,142
Do you believe those cockney klutzes
bought our story? What morons!

101
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,352
- I want you to know something.
- What?

102
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,148
Even if you were my brother,
I'd still want to fuck you.

103
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,275
Oooh!

104
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,570
- Make the call.
- Momento, carissima.

105
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,530
No. No Italian!

106
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,698
Hey!

107
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:27,829
Per cominciare, due insalate verdi
con peperoni e un linguini primavera.

108
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,707
No. Make the call, Otto.

109
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,170
- Are you really Italian?
- Absolutamente. Si.

110
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,965
My name is Otto. It means eight.
Say "Arrivederci a Giorgio."

111
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:42,177
- Bye, George.
- Police, please.

112
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,304
- Otto!
- Argh!

113
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:49,392
Hello.
I thought it might interest you to know

114
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,896
that the Hatton Garden robbery
today was pulled off

115
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:56,566
by a Mr. George Thomason, who lives at

116
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,486
Flat 3, Kipling Mansions,

117
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:03,239
Murray Road, London, West 9.

118
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,325
Wanda?

119
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,433
Police! Open up!

120
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,521
Come on, open up!

121
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,068
Open the door, or we'll knock it down.

122
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,247
George Francis Thomason?

123
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,637
Passport, tickets...

124
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,722
...money.

125
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,312
Asshole!

126
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,992
- We're rich, Wanda.
- Yep?

127
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,995
I bet these last two weeks with me

128
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,873
have been the most exciting
two weeks of your life.

129
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,958
You said it.

130
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:52,307
OK.

131
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,142
Disappointed!

132
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,936
Son of a bitch!

133
00:14:57,104 --> 00:15:00,148
What do you have to do in this life
to make people trust you?

134
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,774
Shut up.

135
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,319
People always take advantage of me.

136
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,487
Shut up and think.
Where's he moved it?

137
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,994
- What are you doing?
- I'm thinking!

138
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,913
Thinking what I'll do to him.

139
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,998
First, I'll hang him up
with piano wire...

140
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,792
- Where are you going?
- To talk to him.

141
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,669
Then...

142
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,838
Talk to who? Talk to who?!

143
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,175
So while installing windows
for your parents,

144
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:31,012
you were kneeling on the floor
where there was broken glass?

145
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,307
- That's right, sir.
- And your parents can confirm this?

146
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,352
Yes. And his aunt, Georgina Thomason.

147
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,395
Good, Bartlett.

148
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,356
Yes?

149
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,149
Sorry to interrupt you, sir.

150
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,027
- Thomason, lady to see you.
- Anything else?

151
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,696
No. You don't have to
dash off, do you?

152
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,032
No, absolutely not. George?

153
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,035
Ken's got the fish food.
He'll be in later.

154
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,204
- Thanks.
- De nada.

155
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,040
- What do you think?
- We may be all right on the glass.

156
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,668
But what else are they
gonna come up with?

157
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:16,516
Oh, George! Oh, my God,
I can't believe this is happening!

158
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,268
That's not allowed in here, miss.

159
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,604
- Are you OK?
- It's all right.

160
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,148
I don't think I can handle this.

161
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,401
I was so afraid
to go to sleep last night, I...

162
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,070
Leave it out. Leave it out, OK?

163
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,657
Now listen, listen, listen, listen.
Listen.

164
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,786
You stayed at my place.

165
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:41,582
We slept late. You made me breakfast.

166
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,381
What?

167
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:52,760
- What's he doing here?
- He wanted to see you.

168
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,763
Who did it, George? Kevin Delaney?

169
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,766
Want me to rub him out?
Anything. You name it.

170
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,937
- I have friends making enquiries.
- Good.

171
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,566
The jewels are very safe.

172
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:10,278
If I get sent down, it all gets
handed back to cut my sentence.

173
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:14,907
Now, to cut my sentence even more,
I could tell them who done it with me,

174
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:18,619
if I wasn't very happy about everything.

175
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,123
What was the middle thing?

176
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,333
Piss off.

177
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,715
- You want me to spring you?
- Now!

178
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,638
George?

179
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,726
- You don't think...?
- Do you?

180
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,811
No!

181
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,982
No?

182
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,652
- No.
- OK.

183
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,863
- George?
- What?

184
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,366
Are you sure the garage is very safe?

185
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,120
Trust me.

186
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,706
Thank you very much.

187
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,375
Thanks a lot. Bye. Have a good day.

188
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,838
- So?
- Well, he's not sure it was you.

189
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,173
What about you?

190
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,259
He believes me.
He can't figure out you.

191
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:19,138
- Figure out what?
- If you turned him in or not, stupid!

192
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:23,684
Don't, uh, ever, ever,

193
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:26,979
ever call me stupid. OK?

194
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,526
What?

195
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,031
That's George's lawyer.

196
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,867
The other guy must be the barrister.

197
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,538
- So?
- Trust me.

198
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,127
- Let me know if anything turns up.
- Yes.

199
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,379
Excuse me.

200
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,756
Don't I recognize you?

201
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,883
No. No, I don't think so.

202
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,552
Oh.

203
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,763
But you are
a famous barrister, aren't you?

204
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,432
Er... well, hardly.

205
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,270
Well, could I have
your autograph anyway?

206
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,274
- Yes, yes. Certainly.
- Thanks.

207
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,570
I'm studying aspects of your legal
system. I'm American.

208
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:18,239
- Oh, really?
- I've just started, though.

209
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,407
It's fascinating.

210
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,993
What, er, what brings you here?

211
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:26,164
Oh, it's a little embarrassing.
I... have a friend.

212
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,417
Oh! Oh, I see. Well, there you are.

213
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,795
I knew it! You're Archie Leash!

214
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,922
- Leach.
- Right!

215
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,759
I saw you in court. Uh, two weeks ago.

216
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,263
- The casino break-in?
- You were great!

217
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:47,185
Oh, I'm a big fan of yours.
I love the way you... cross-examine.

218
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:52,690
- Oh, I really admire your work.
- Thank you.

219
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,613
- I'd better not...
- I don't suppose you...? No. Fine.

220
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,281
Well...

221
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,284
Thank you for this. I'll treasure it.

222
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,788
Au revoir.

223
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,084
You speak French, too.

224
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,648
What's going on?

225
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:37,568
Whatever George decides to do,
he's gonna tell Leach first.

226
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,238
- Why?
- Because he's his lawyer.

227
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:44,492
- Yeah, yeah. I know that.
- So I'm gonna get to know Mr. Leach.

228
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,119
George will tell him
where the diamonds are?

229
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,705
That's what I'm gonna find out.

230
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,886
You done well, my son.

231
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,555
Now, where are we going to hide it?

232
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:16,023
Very good! Don't tell Wanda anything.
Otto might get something out of her.

233
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,526
- Now...
- George...

234
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,404
You are gonna g-g-get off, aren't you?

235
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:25,783
Sure, don't worry about it, Ken.
We'll fix it. Now, anything on Otto?

236
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,869
Not yet.

237
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,746
You watch him.

238
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,626
Ken?

239
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,462
OK.

240
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,215
Looks like the police
have been all over it.

241
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:44,885
Let me just change clothes,
and then I'll help you look.

242
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:49,265
Hello, K-K-Ken's p-p-pets.

243
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,642
Hey!

244
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:55,563
Wake up! Wake up, limey fish!

245
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,068
So, how are you gonna
get friendly with this lawyer?

246
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,738
I don't know. I'll improvise.

247
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,406
Fucking insects!

248
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:09,160
I thought Englishmen didn't like women,
the way they talk.

249
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:14,081
No. He's straight. He's kinda cute,
too, in a pompous sort ofway.

250
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,962
- You got the hots for him?
- I'm not into necrophilia.

251
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,592
What is this,
Hump a Limey Week suddenly?

252
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,762
Otto doesn't approve.
Otto might getjealous.

253
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:32,892
E molto pericoloso, signorina.

254
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,102
Molto pericolo...

255
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,445
- Carissima.
- Oh, speak it. Speak it!

256
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,240
Un ossobuco milanese con piselli.

257
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:54,246
Melanzane parmigiana con spinaci.

258
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:57,458
- Dov'e la farmacia?
- Yes, yes, yes!

259
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,293
- No, no, no.
- Si, si, si.

260
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,796
No, no, no. No, not here.

261
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,048
- Otto, no.
- Dov'e la Fontana di Trevi?

262
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,717
- Not here, Otto!
- Um...

263
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,928
- Mozzarella.
- No! Not here.

264
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,430
- Parmigiana. Gorgonzola!
- Otto, no!

265
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:12,640
Eh!

266
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,480
Wanda?

267
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,821
Look what I've got, Wanda.

268
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,282
Treasure!

269
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,037
Oh!

270
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:20,124
Oh, Ken, it's you!
I thought it was the police again.

271
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,043
Isn't it horrible about George? Oh, Ken!

272
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:26,380
I've such a headache.
Could you pick me up some aspirin?

273
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:31,135
- What's that?
- My brother. He's using the bathroom.

274
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,762
- Otto?
- Mm. We just went and saw George.

275
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,057
Oh, it was horrible, Ken.
It was just horrible.

276
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,940
- Wh...
- Isn't it terrible about George?

277
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:48,068
When I find the bastard who squealed...!

278
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,404
I love that man!

279
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,157
What are you d-d-doing here?

280
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,409
What am I doing here?

281
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,661
Wanda was upset. She needed family.

282
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:02,249
Sh-sh-she just had a sh-sh-shower.

283
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:08,214
I've got to speak to you.

284
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,341
- Are you OK now, sis?
- I'm fine.

285
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,843
- Call me if you need me.
- OK. Thanks.

286
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:18,265
What's the matter?
Can't you think about her feelings?

287
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,852
- There's something f-f-funny going on.
- Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

288
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,604
You don't even know
why you're excited.

289
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,732
- I saw...
- Ken, Ken, Ken!

290
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,818
I didn't wanna say anything
with George here,

291
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,780
but isn't it time you faced reality?

292
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:36,325
Come on!
You're a very attractive man, Ken.

293
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,786
You're smart. You've got...

294
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:43,332
...wonderful bones, great eyes,
and you dress really interestingly.

295
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,627
- Wh-what...
- We could have fun together, you and I.

296
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:50,172
And I think we'd be really good
for each other. What do you say?

297
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,968
You must be j-j-j...

298
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,512
- May I kiss you?
- No, you fucking can't!

299
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,306
- Just a peck! No tongue! Ken!
- No!

300
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:09,149
Ken! OK. You didn't realize I was gay.

301
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:12,152
OK. No, look, I'm sorry.

302
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,532
I've handled this badly.
Look... the physical side can wait.

303
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,368
You need time.

304
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,413
But... will you think about it?

305
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,980
Oh, my God.

306
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,609
Oh, my God!

307
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,070
Ken, somebody just called!

308
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:59,700
They said that the police know
that the loot is in a garage in Fulham.

309
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,702
You and I have to go get it.

310
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,038
You and I have to go move it
before the police find it.

311
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,081
- No, no, no.
- What?

312
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,541
- It's all right!
- What?

313
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,126
Ge-Ge-Ge...

314
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,045
George.

315
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,547
- M-m-m...
- Moved.

316
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,884
George moved the loot?!

317
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,052
Yes.

318
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,679
Where'd he move it, Ken?!
Where did he move it?!

319
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,514
C-c-c...

320
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,612
I don't know where it is. There's a key.

321
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,822
I don't know what it's for.
It's in the...

322
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:44,328
Don't tell me.
It's better that you don't tell me.

323
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:49,416
Oh, you know, if it wasn't for George...

324
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,215
Otto...

325
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:00,344
...tried to k-k-kiss me.

326
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:05,140
I thought he might.

327
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,604
No. Nothing, no marks at all.

328
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,940
- But it is a safety deposit box key?
- Oh, yes.

329
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,150
But there are millions of them.

330
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,778
Hotels, banks, offices... Sorry.

331
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,280
Thank you.

332
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,324
Fuck!

333
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,969
That's him. That's him, Inspector.

334
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,805
He's the one who tried
to murder my dogs.

335
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,325
Davidson?

336
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:09,830
There's an American legal student wants
to see me. What time is Sir John due?

337
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,666
- Half-past twelve, sir.
- Right.

338
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:24,303
Come in.

339
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,848
- Hi.
- How very nice to see you.

340
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,392
- Am I interrupting?
- Absolutely not.

341
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,895
- Really?
- No, really. Delighted to see you.

342
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,980
Hello.

343
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:41,195
So... this is the place, huh?

344
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,822
- This is it.
- Very nice.

345
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:48,410
I was over at the courts this morning.
Boy, it's fascinating! So much to know.

346
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:51,038
Everybody wears these.
Do you wear one?

347
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:53,040
Ridiculous!

348
00:29:56,211 --> 00:30:00,130
Well, um, I only have
a few minutes before... Sorry.

349
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:04,176
- But till then, I'm all yours.
- I just have a couple of questions.

350
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,428
- Uh-huh.
- Um...

351
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:11,391
I'm having a problem understanding
preliminary criminal procedures.

352
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,227
Good.

353
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,521
What exactly is the committal?

354
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:20,567
Ah, interesting. Well, basically,
it's a preliminary investigation

355
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:25,405
where the prosecution presents evidence
that the accused has a case to answer.

356
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:28,700
That's what the books say.
Let's take, for example...

357
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,411
- my friend George Thomason.
- Right.

358
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,372
Now, when he goes into his committal...

359
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,415
Thomason?

360
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,960
- Yes.
- George Thomason?

361
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,754
Yes. Do you know him?

362
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:45,717
- I'm defending him.
- What are you talking about?

363
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:48,095
I'm his barrister. His lawyer.

364
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,890
That's so great!

365
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,561
That's so weird, though.
Isn't that weird?

366
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:58,230
I'm so happy it's you
that's defending him.

367
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,400
- Thank you.
- He's sure to get off now.

368
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:05,904
Wow! Well, I can watch you work now.

369
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,990
Please.

370
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:16,290
Amazing. Well, anyway, at the committal
George would then plead...?

371
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,625
- Not guilty.
- Really?

372
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:21,795
Oh, yes. The evidence
is largely circumstantial.

373
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,339
There was an identification,
wasn't there?

374
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:28,635
Ah, true. But a very elderly lady.
I think they've got the wrong man.

375
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:33,056
- You don't think he did it?
- No.

376
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:38,103
Let's say, for argument's sake,
that you did think he did it.

377
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:41,773
Sure. If further evidence against
him came to light, for example.

378
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:46,028
Right, right. You would then
advise him to plead guilty,

379
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:49,781
and turn over the jewels
to get his sentence cut.

380
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:53,076
And he would turn them
over to who? To you?

381
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,914
- Theoretically?
- Oh, of course.

382
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,166
Um... Well, er...

383
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,754
I'm so sorry, I've forgotten your name.

384
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,842
- Wanda.
- Wanda! What a fool, what a fool.

385
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,470
Well, Wanda, there are really three...

386
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,518
Not Wanda Gershwitz?

387
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:21,563
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

388
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,900
- What?
- You're his alibi.

389
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,277
- I can't talk to you.
- Why not?

390
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:32,407
My dear lady, you are a defense witness.
I must ask you to leave immediately.

391
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,909
What did I say?

392
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,745
It's not ethical for me
to talk to a witness.

393
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:40,582
- Everybody does it in America.
- Not in England. It's forbidden.

394
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:45,545
I must insist, otherwise I may have
to give up the case. I'm sorry. Please?

395
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,219
Oh, Archie.

396
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:58,684
I didn't come here today to talk
about boring criminal procedures.

397
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,271
Come on, you know.

398
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,941
You knew the minute I walked in here.

399
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,611
I want you.

400
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,032
What?

401
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,661
- Hello?
- Sir John is here.

402
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,414
- Show him in.
- I want you to make love with me.

403
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,249
- Pardon?
- Nothing.

404
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,585
- Will you take me to bed, Archie?
- No. Sorry.

405
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,465
Bye, Uncle.

406
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,762
Hi!

407
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:57,117
He's pleading not guilty,
so you're safe until the trial.

408
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,954
Leach doesn't think he did it.

409
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:07,085
Ken says there's a safe deposit box key,
but only George knows where it is.

410
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,464
Thank you, Wanda!

411
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:17,179
- What have you found out?
- Not a lot.

412
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:20,557
- You realize he's in court tomorrow?
- I know. I know that!

413
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,602
- So nothing, huh?
- Nix.

414
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,771
Zip.

415
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:26,938
Diddly.

416
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:29,066
Bupkas.

417
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,069
Niente.

418
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,367
- Oh, it's too big!
- No, it isn't, Portia.

419
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,578
- It is. It's enormous!
- No, it isn't.

420
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,623
- Oh, please, Mother!
- No. Absolutely not.

421
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,958
I'm so miserable
and you just don't care!

422
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,169
Do shut up, Portia!

423
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:53,590
All I get all day
is people complaining to me.

424
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,258
Oh, dear.

425
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,185
Ecco I'uomo.

426
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:25,288
Ooh, le due cupole grandi
della cattedrale di Milano.

427
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,544
Benito Mussolini!

428
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,976
Dov'e il Vaticano?

429
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,814
Oh, ecco Roma.

430
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,618
Volare

431
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,411
Oh-oh

432
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,497
E cantare, oh...

433
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:05,180
Archie, I want you to speak
to her about plastic surgery.

434
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,391
- Hm?
- Do listen.

435
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,768
I want you to speak to Portia.

436
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,479
Right. I'll have a word
with her in the morning.

437
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:17,484
Good night, Archie.

438
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,778
Good night, Wanda.

439
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,155
Good night, who?

440
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,116
Oh, sorry, darling. Just a stupid case

441
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:28,203
I've got tomorrow
with some lousy old hag.

442
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:31,665
Are you George Francis Thomason

443
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:35,502
of Kipling Mansions,
Murray Avenue, London, W9?

444
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,840
- Yes, sir.
- The charge is one of armed robbery.

445
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:44,302
Sit down, Mr. Thomason.
Are we ready for a committal claim?

446
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,681
Yes. It will be
under Section 6.2, madam.

447
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,099
That is correct, 6.2.

448
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:53,061
Here are the statements.
All to be fully bound, please.

449
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,731
Stand up then, Mr. Thomason.

450
00:37:56,899 --> 00:38:01,194
You are committed to stand trial
at the Central Criminal Court.

451
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,697
There is some urgency
about this case, madam,

452
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:07,200
as the main witness,
Mrs. Eileen Coady, is elderly

453
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,870
and has had serious
heart difficulties recently.

454
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:15,750
Is there any possibility that this case
might be put down for an early trial?

455
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,587
That will be for
the listing office at the Old Bailey.

456
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,882
- Take him down to the cell, officer.
- Yes, sir.

457
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:45,572
Hi, hon. How you doin'?
Ooh, you look great. I love your hair.

458
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,657
- Time for a coffee?
- No. I've g-g-g...

459
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,660
Have you thought about it?
Why did he give you this?

460
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,747
"Eileen Coady. 69 Basil Street."

461
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:57,208
What does he want you to do?
Send her flowers? Do her shopping?

462
00:38:57,376 --> 00:39:00,462
Show her a good time? Rub her out? T...

463
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,508
He wants you to rub her out?

464
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,427
Er...

465
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,804
He's going to kill her!

466
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,768
Fuck off, or I'll kill you.

467
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,978
Limey fruits!

468
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:22,442
So the old lady's gonna m-m-meet
with an accident, eh, K-K-Ken?

469
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,778
Shh!

470
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:26,946
What's so funny?

471
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:30,450
It's just that wasting
old ladies isn't nice!

472
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,953
Well, it's better than
b-b-buggering people.

473
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,332
I bet you a pound you don't kill her.

474
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,835
- All right.
- All right.

475
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:46,174
I love watching your ass when you walk.
Is that beautiful or what?!

476
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,887
Don't go near him! He's mine!

477
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,848
A pound says you won't kill her!

478
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,688
- So when could you look at it?
- Let's think. Thursday's hopeless.

479
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,941
My wife's going to the opera Friday.

480
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,443
I could look at it then,
call you on Saturday.

481
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,029
- I'd appreciate that. Thanks.
- Bye, Frank.

482
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,031
Hi.

483
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:13,326
I know we're not allowed to talk.
Gimme a call.

484
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,745
I can't!

485
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,998
- Please?
- We're not allowed to speak.

486
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,626
We don't have to.

487
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:24,462
I don't want you for your conversation.

488
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,718
I'd love to, but...

489
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,899
- What happened?
- Got a date Friday.

490
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:05,545
Look here! Do you mind
not making that terrible noise?

491
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,506
My dogs will be having their nap.

492
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:11,050
Nice doggy. Nice d-doggy.

493
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,614
Otto, what are you doing?

494
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:36,409
It's a Buddhist meditation technique.
Focuses your aggression.

495
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:41,039
- The monks used to do it before battle.
- What kind of Buddhism is this, Otto?

496
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,420
Asshole!

497
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:52,091
It's an early Tantric meditation.
What is this?

498
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:56,095
In order to get information, I just
might have to get friendly with him.

499
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,182
Well, we're ready now, at last.

500
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,184
Oh, good.
Well, enjoy the opera, darling.

501
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,895
- Your supper's in the fridge.
- Marvelous.

502
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,147
Be good.

503
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,859
When you say "friendly,"
what are we talking about here?

504
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:13,029
Cordial? Courteous?
Supportive? What?

505
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,282
I don't know.
Let's just see what happens.

506
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:22,288
So, "friendly" might include
actual, uh, what? Penetration?

507
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:24,749
- I don't need yourjealousy now.
- Jealousy?

508
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,627
- Yes.
- Hey, I'm merely curious.

509
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,421
Me, jealous of that fop?

510
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:41,641
- What about my tits?
- Does he get to handle them?

511
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,978
Yes. That's my forecast.
I'll stand by that.

512
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:48,147
- Nuzzling?
- I think $20 million is worth nuzzling.

513
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,608
Eighty percent chance there.

514
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,360
- Sucking?
- I thought you weren'tjealous.

515
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:55,947
I'm not! I don't believe in jealousy.
It's for the weak.

516
00:42:56,115 --> 00:43:00,034
One thing, though.
Touch his dick and he's dead!

517
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,167
I told your father
to get the car serviced.

518
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:11,129
- Aren't we going, then?
- Oh, do shut up, Portia.

519
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,060
Hurry up.

520
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,119
Hi.

521
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,831
Do you despise me?

522
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:54,088
No. That's not a word
that leaps to mind.

523
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,425
Can I stay, then?

524
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:05,183
Of course. Look... Wanda...

525
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:09,103
- I know. Your wife's coming back.
- No, no. It's not her.

526
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,564
She'll be gone for hours.
It's about what I said to you.

527
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:15,151
- It is all right for us to speak.
- It is?

528
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,112
Provided that we don't discuss the case.

529
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:22,075
Oh. Oh, fine.

530
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,744
It's just that if anyone
saw us talking...

531
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,412
Oh, but they won't.

532
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,881
Sorry if I seem... pompous.

533
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,467
Oh, you're the best, Archie.

534
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,431
No.

535
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,267
Not yet. I'm thirsty.

536
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,106
What shall I get you?

537
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,151
Whisky.

538
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:05,952
You are the sexiest,
most beautiful girl I have ever seen...

539
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,497
...in my entire life.

540
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,377
Get me my drink.

541
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:35,982
Oh!

542
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:41,988
Oh, Archie.

543
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,619
So...

544
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:52,498
if George decides to change his plea,

545
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:55,752
he'd tell you where
the loot is first, wouldn't he?

546
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,754
Mm?

547
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:00,381
Darling, we mustn't talk
about the trial.

548
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:03,384
I know. I just meant theoretically.

549
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,637
Kiss me there.

550
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:10,391
Oh, theoretically? Um...

551
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:15,813
Well, if the defendant
wants to change his plea

552
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:19,192
and his instructions
to his legal representative...

553
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,112
...the normal procedure...

554
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:31,370
- What's the matter?
- Oh, it's wonderful, Archie.

555
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:37,543
- Ah!
- What? What?

556
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:40,755
You're getting me so hot!
I need something to drink.

557
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:44,175
- Yeah.
- Something cold? Maybe in the fridge?

558
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:47,011
- Champagne?
- Oh, my favorite!

559
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,515
Don't go away.

560
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,728
Je reviens.

561
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,240
- What are you doing here?
- Relax.

562
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:10,117
- Get the fuck out!
- I heard moaning. I was worried.

563
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:12,119
I was faking it, you stupid jerk!

564
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:14,497
Don't call me stupid.
And I'm notjealous.

565
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,749
- Then leave!
- OK!

566
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,670
Nice place.

567
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,798
Don't touch his dick.

568
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:27,677
His wife, his wife!

569
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,181
Now for goodness sake, get off to bed.

570
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:39,480
God! There isn't any ice.

571
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,283
Champagne.

572
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:53,286
What's the matter?

573
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,331
What are you doing?

574
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:03,045
Champagne, dear. To welcome you home.
Um, let me pour you a glass.

575
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:06,799
Whose is the car?

576
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,302
- Car?
- Blocking the drive.

577
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,471
There you are, dear.
Cheers. Nice to see you again.

578
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:16,183
- How was the opera? Finished early?
- Whose car is it?

579
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,604
Mine. It's a beauty, isn't it?

580
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:22,189
Where'd I leave my drink, Archie? Ah!

581
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,403
- Who is this?
- Don't you know?

582
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:31,532
How do you do, Mrs. Leach?
I'm Harvey Manfren... jensen.

583
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,535
- I'm, uh, with the CIA.
- The CIA?

584
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,621
That's correct, ma'am.

585
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:39,040
I was, uh, just
telling your husband here,

586
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:43,044
before I, uh, had to go
to your beautiful bathroom,

587
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:47,632
we've got a high-ranking KGB defector
in a safe house near here.

588
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:51,010
We're debriefing him
as of now and just...

589
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,554
...checking houses in the neighborhood.

590
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:55,681
- For what?
- For KGB.

591
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:59,894
- Is there any danger?
- No, no, no, no. No, uh...

592
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,688
No. No, not now. We, uh...

593
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,483
We just wanna keep everyone informed.

594
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:09,236
So, Archie, thanks for the drink.
Sorry to have troubled you.

595
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,822
Keep everyone informed?

596
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:15,201
- So there's no panic, ma'am.
- But isn't it a secret?

597
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,663
- You have no idea how secret.
- Why are you telling everyone?

598
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,042
- It's a smoke screen?
- What?!

599
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:25,044
Double bluff.

600
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,005
Look, you know nothing
about intelligence work.

601
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,716
It's an XK Red 27 technique.

602
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:34,136
My father was in the secret service,
Mr. Manfredjin St. John,

603
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:37,348
and I know that you don't
keep the public informed

604
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:41,185
when you are debriefing
KGB defectors in a safe house.

605
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,561
You don't, huh?

606
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:46,941
Not unless you're congenitally insane
or irretrievably stupid, no.

607
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,696
- Don't call me stupid.
- Why on earth not?

608
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:57,785
Oh, you English are
so superior, aren't you?

609
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:02,206
Would you like to know where you'd be
without us, the US ofA, to protect you?

610
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:05,584
I'll tell you.
The smallest fucking province

611
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,753
in the Russian Empire, that's what!

612
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:10,715
So don't call me stupid, lady.
Just thank me!

613
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:13,467
Thank you for popping in
and protecting us!

614
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:16,595
If it wasn't for us, you'd all
be speaking German! Singing:

615
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:20,558
Deutschland, Deutschland uber alles

616
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:23,936
That's my brother. Get rid of your wife
and get my necklace.

617
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:26,355
Necklace. Right.
I'll think of something.

618
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,983
- Who are you talking to?
- Myself.

619
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:32,778
- Well, who was that shouting?
- The brother of a f-friend of mine.

620
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,864
Archie, who on earth?

621
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,949
I don't know.
He rang the bell and I...

622
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,326
- I need a drink.
- Let's go to the pub.

623
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:41,328
- What?
- Let's go to the pub.

624
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:44,373
- Would you like to?
- We haven't been for 15 years!

625
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,208
Be rather nice for Portia
to see it now.

626
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,335
Honestly!

627
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:52,006
- What on earth is the matter?
- I thought the picture was falling.

628
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:55,134
- Will you pull yourself together?
- It's secure now.

629
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:59,138
- What's this?
- Thanks, Portia. OK. Coming with us?

630
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,348
- What was that?
- A necklace.

631
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:04,018
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Right, let's go.

632
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,062
- Can I see that?
- What?

633
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,980
In your hand.

634
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,857
Your other hand.

635
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:15,362
Portia, go to your room.
I can explain. I left some papers...

636
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,240
- Now! They sent a new girl.
- Oh, Archie.

637
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:22,828
- No, really. She's Canadian.
- It's lovely. Thank you.

638
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,793
Oh, it's even got a W for Wendy.

639
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,546
Oh, I'm so glad you like it, darling.

640
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:36,050
It's the most beautiful thing
you've ever given me.

641
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:42,807
Oh, Archie! This isn't like you.

642
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,859
Are you fucking crazy?!

643
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:58,155
- Hey, I saved your ass.
- I had him right where I wanted him!

644
00:51:58,323 --> 00:52:01,242
- Hey...
- I give you one thing to do, Otto!

645
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:04,120
You're supposed to drive me and shut up!

646
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:16,799
Hello?

647
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,051
Hold on. It's for you.

648
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,430
Hello?

649
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:28,060
Er, not at the moment, no.

650
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:35,192
Yes, well, I'm not quite sure
when I'll be able to get hold of that.

651
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:39,989
Yes, yes. I do appreciate that.
Yes, as soon as possible.

652
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:44,702
Well, that would be very nice,
obviously.

653
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:47,663
So, um, see you soon, I hope.

654
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,165
Bye, Frank.

655
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:56,297
Calm down. Calm down! Easy, g-g-girl.

656
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:58,591
Easy. Easy.

657
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:06,557
Come here.

658
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,768
Smell. Smell. Smell, Maggie. Smell.

659
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:13,355
Now, k-k-kill!

660
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:16,609
Kill!

661
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,278
Kill!

662
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,487
Kill!

663
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:47,431
We therefore commit
its body to the ground;

664
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,851
earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

665
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,937
dust to dust...

666
00:53:53,104 --> 00:54:04,323
Miserere domine

667
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:08,244
Canis mortuus est

668
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:13,582
Hello, honey. What happened?

669
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,669
- N-n-nothing.
- What's that?

670
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:19,004
- Er...
- Not Granny?

671
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:21,674
Er, not yet, n-n-no.

672
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:23,801
- Who's it for, then?
- Af-f-f...

673
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,971
A fish? Frenchman? A phone operator?

674
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:30,516
- Friend.
- Oh! A four-legged one?

675
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,435
- Where's my sister?
- She's in the b-b-b...

676
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,063
- Thank you.
- Lavatory.

677
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,982
Wanda.

678
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:42,361
- Anything?
- What? No.

679
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:46,031
- Why are you here?
- I'm here because I'm bored!

680
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:51,370
Bored, wandering around this God-awful
city, shoving George's ugly pic...

681
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:55,582
Talking to stuck-up,
intellectually inferior British faggots.

682
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,543
Jesus, they're uptight.

683
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:01,380
They get rigor mortis
in the prime of life in this country.

684
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:04,717
Standing there
with their hair clenched, just...

685
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:08,262
...counting the seconds
till the weekend,

686
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,556
so that they can
dress up like ballerinas

687
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:14,226
and whip themselves
into a frenzy at the flat at four...

688
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,228
2B, St...

689
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:20,441
To be... honest, I, uh, hate them.

690
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:24,737
I mean, pretending
they're so fucking lawyer...

691
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:29,408
Uh, superior. So fucking superior,
with those phony accents.

692
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,580
Not you, Ken. You've got a beautiful
speaking voice. When it works.

693
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,665
Son of a bitch!

694
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,507
Wanna have some lunch?
Have you heard from him?

695
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,634
- Who?
- Archie.

696
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:50,596
No. I have to finish my hair.
No.

697
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,640
Nothing?
OK. Well, I'm outta here!

698
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,601
No plans to see him?

699
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,062
No.
OK, bye, bro.

700
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:00,356
Bye, Wanda!

701
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,818
Oh, sorry.

702
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:10,324
- What?!
- An old lady wanted it engraved,

703
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:14,203
and she's dying, and somebody
put it in the display cabinet...

704
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,455
- That's their problem.
- Not legally.

705
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,916
- You paid for it!
- They accept their mistake.

706
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:22,044
That's why they're offering
you this to replace it.

707
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,880
This is the nicest thing
you've ever given me,

708
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,673
and you want me to replace it
with something awful...

709
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,759
- I don't want...
- They can't have it.

710
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,135
- Wendy.
- No.

711
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:34,139
- Wendy!
- No! Tell them they can't have it!

712
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:36,725
You're the bloody barrister!

713
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,969
- Hello.
- Hello.

714
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,807
Oh, Archie, it's beautiful.

715
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,226
It's just beautiful.

716
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,647
Oh, my God! Look!

717
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,359
Oh, Archie, it's beautiful.

718
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,820
Isn't it wonderful?

719
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:32,698
- Whose is it?
- Belongs to someone at the chambers.

720
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,366
And where are they?

721
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,077
Hong Kong.

722
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,787
Ah, so.

723
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,956
Gone for weeks.

724
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,208
Nice rug, Archie.

725
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,045
May I?

726
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:50,090
What?! Archie, what are you doing?

727
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,342
The polka, I think.

728
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:59,224
- You make me feel free!
- Free?

729
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:04,480
Wanda, do you have any idea
what it's like being English?

730
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,399
Being so correct all the time?
Being so...

731
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:11,862
stifled by this dread
of doing the wrong thing?

732
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:13,697
Of saying to someone "Are you married?"

733
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:16,366
And hearing
"My wife left me this morning?"

734
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:18,827
Or saying... "Do you have children?"

735
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:22,748
and being told they all burned
to death on Wednesday?

736
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:27,544
You see, Wanda, we're all...
terrified of embarrassment.

737
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:30,797
That's why we're so... dead.

738
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,550
Most of my friends are dead.

739
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:36,094
You know, we have these
piles of corpses to dinner.

740
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:39,806
But you're alive, God bless you.

741
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:42,601
And I wanna be.
I'm so fed up with all this!

742
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,606
I wanna make love with you, Wanda.

743
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,483
I'm a good lover. At least...

744
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,070
...used to be,
back in the early 14th century.

745
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:55,864
Can we go to bed?

746
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,288
Yeah.

747
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:07,042
Hang on! Mind your head.

748
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,219
I think I love you, Wanda.

749
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:21,431
Oh, Archie. Can I ask you a question?

750
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,560
- Anything.
- Where's my locket?

751
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,271
- I couldn't get it.
- What?

752
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:30,983
Wendy wouldn't give it back.
Look, I got you this instead.

753
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:36,446
- Do you like it?
- No, Archie. I have to have mine.

754
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:39,241
What's the matter? Why?

755
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:42,911
My mother gave it to me...

756
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:47,374
...on her death... bed.

757
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:52,671
Oh, I'm sorry. All right, darling.
I'll... I'll get it for you.

758
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,674
- You promise?
- I'll think of something.

759
00:59:55,842 --> 01:00:01,221
Sex is very, very difficult for me with
somebody that I don't trust completely.

760
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:04,683
I promise I'll get it. OK?

761
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:08,145
Oh, I love you, Archie.

762
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:13,150
I have loved you ever since
the first second I saw you.

763
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:18,196
- What was that?
- What?

764
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,867
Your brother didn't bring you, did he?

765
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,869
No.

766
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:26,079
He's no idea?

767
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:29,041
- He doesn't have a clue.
- What?

768
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:32,294
- He is so dumb.
- Really?

769
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:36,632
He thought that the Gettysburg Address
was where Lincoln lived.

770
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:44,097
Oh, those terrible lies
he told about the CIA!

771
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:45,766
So painful!

772
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:48,477
And when he heard
your daughter's called Portia,

773
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,855
he said "Why did
they name her after a car?"

774
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:59,029
I love the way you laugh.

775
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:01,615
I love you. You're funny.

776
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:08,330
How come a girl as... bright as you
could have a brother who's so...

777
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:11,416
Don't call me stupid.

778
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:13,669
Jesus Christ!

779
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,630
Argh!

780
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,757
Come on!

781
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,802
- Otto! Ouch!
- Come on!

782
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:24,054
- Otto!
- Come on.

783
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:27,599
I'll deal with you later!

784
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:31,561
- What have you done with her?
- She's all right.

785
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:34,564
- Otto!
- Now, apologize.

786
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:37,234
What?

787
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:38,944
Apologize.

788
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:42,280
Are you totally deranged?

789
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:49,454
You pompous,

790
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:52,290
stuck-up, snot-nosed,

791
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,960
English, giant-twerp,

792
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:58,672
scumbag, fuck-face, dickhead asshole!

793
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:03,301
How very interesting.
You're a true vulgarian, aren't you?

794
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:06,888
You're the vulgarian, you fuck!
Now apologize!

795
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:10,142
What? Me to you?

796
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:17,274
Apologize.

797
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,651
All right, all right. I apologize.

798
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:22,279
- You're really sorry?
- I'm really sorry.

799
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:24,656
I apologize unreservedly.

800
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:29,995
- You take it back?
- I do. I offer a complete retraction.

801
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:33,665
The imputation was
totally without basis in fact,

802
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:37,919
and was in no way fair comment,
and was motivated purely by malice.

803
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:42,841
I deeply regret any distress my comments
may have caused you or your family.

804
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:48,555
And I hereby undertake not to repeat any
such slander at any time in the future.

805
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:52,350
OK.

806
01:03:54,413 --> 01:04:04,965
Miserere domine

807
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:09,678
Canis mortuus est

808
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:11,721
You said you loved him!

809
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:15,267
That's right!
Here's a question for you.

810
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:19,563
Wanda was lying.
Wanda was telling the truth.

811
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:22,065
Which one are you gonna pick?

812
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:25,193
What was the first one?
You said you weren't gonna see him!

813
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:27,112
'Cause I knew you'd come along
and fuck it up!

814
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,865
I was dealing with something delicate.

815
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:32,200
I'm setting up a guy
who's important to us,

816
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:35,620
who'll tell me where the loot is
and if you'll be arrested,

817
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:40,292
and you come loping in like Rambo and
you dangle him out a fifth-floor window!

818
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:42,460
Now, was that smart?!

819
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:45,255
- OK.
- Was it shrewd? Was it good tactics?

820
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:47,465
Or was it stupid?!

821
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:50,802
Don't call me stupid.

822
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:55,348
Oh, right! To call you stupid
would be an insult to stupid people!

823
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:59,769
I've known sheep that could outwit you.
I've worn dresses with higher IQs.

824
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:03,940
But you think you're an intellectual,
don't you, ape?

825
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:07,152
- Apes don't read philosophy.
- Yes, they do, Otto.

826
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,404
They just don't understand it.

827
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:12,699
Now let me correct you
on a couple of things, OK?

828
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:15,410
Aristotle was not Belgian.

829
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:20,123
The central message of Buddhism
is not every man for himself.

830
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:22,500
The London Underground
is not a political movement.

831
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:26,046
Those are all mistakes.
I looked 'em up.

832
01:05:26,797 --> 01:05:29,382
Now... you have just assaulted

833
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:33,094
the one man who can keep you
out ofjail and make you rich.

834
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:35,513
So what are you gonna
do about it, huh?

835
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:38,516
What would an intellectual do?

836
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:41,061
What would Plato do?

837
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:47,192
- Apol...
- Pardon me?

838
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,486
- Apolo...
- What?

839
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:52,405
- Apologize!
- Right!

840
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,034
I'm sorry.

841
01:05:56,577 --> 01:06:00,455
No. Not to me, to Archie.

842
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:03,500
And make it good, or we're dead.

843
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:14,010
Oh, I'm so very, very, very, very s...

844
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:16,262
Fuck you!

845
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:18,807
I'm s...

846
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,226
I'm very, very s...

847
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:24,062
I'm so very s...

848
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:26,898
Very, very, very s...

849
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,039
Very, very...

850
01:06:43,207 --> 01:06:45,208
ssfff...

851
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,574
Hello, Mr. Burglar!

852
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:03,328
Going somewhere?
Thought you could rob Mr. Leach, eh?

853
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:07,415
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.
He happens to be a good friend of mine.

854
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:10,001
- Otto!
- He's gonna be very pleased with me

855
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:15,006
when he finds you all tied up
and ready for the police.

856
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:20,678
And don't call me Otto.
To you, I am Mr...

857
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:30,105
Agh!

858
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:32,607
Oh, God.

859
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:38,029
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

860
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:40,031
I'm sorry.

861
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:42,283
Please. I'm sorry.

862
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:44,994
I'm sorry. I didn't know it was you.

863
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:46,913
How could I know it was you?

864
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:50,125
I mean, how could you
expect me to guess?

865
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:55,421
Stupid jerk! I mean, what the fuck
are you doing robbing your own house?

866
01:08:55,589 --> 01:08:59,801
You asshole! You stupid,
stiff, pompous, English...

867
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,719
Agh!

868
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:04,055
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

869
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:07,225
Uh... Uh...

870
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:09,102
Yeah.

871
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:53,104
God Almighty!

872
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:55,190
Bloody hell!

873
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:04,616
Darling!

874
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:07,493
Are you hurt? Speak to me!

875
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:10,163
Are you hurt?

876
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:12,624
Can't you speak? Archie!

877
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:15,919
Archie, what has happened?

878
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:19,797
Archie, we've been burgled.

879
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:21,799
- Oh, no!
- Well, are you hurt?

880
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:24,302
No. I'm fine. Bit of a headache.

881
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:29,057
I... I, er, I came in here,
somebody hit me, tied me up...

882
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:31,309
- God, is that the time?
- What?

883
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:33,895
Er, I didn't realize
it was quite so late.

884
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:36,272
- What?!
- Er, I'm late for a conference.

885
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:39,984
- A conference? You've been attacked!
- It's nothing. I must fly.

886
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:42,820
- Archie!
- I'll help you tidy up when I get back.

887
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:45,490
- Ah, hello, Portia.
- What's happened?

888
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:49,994
Your father has finally
gone completely mental.

889
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:15,061
Hi.

890
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:28,241
Archie!

891
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:32,829
- Thank you so much.
- Champagne?

892
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:34,872
OK.

893
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:59,689
- To us.
- To us.

894
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:04,652
I went back to the house,
and guess who...

895
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:07,363
Let's make love!

896
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,783
Well, if you absolutely insist.

897
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:12,577
- No.
- What?

898
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:14,829
Here. On the rug.

899
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:17,832
I'll be right back.

900
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,335
Get undressed.

901
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:22,754
Why not?

902
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:24,964
Why not indeed?

903
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,676
Afterwards...

904
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:32,138
- Yeah?
- ...let's go to South America.

905
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:35,767
- What?
- Let's fly to South America.

906
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:39,187
- Why South America?
- OK. Iceland?

907
01:12:42,816 --> 01:12:45,777
What do you really want
out of life, Wanda?

908
01:12:45,944 --> 01:12:49,113
- I don't know.
- Why do I like you so much?

909
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:51,449
- Archie?
- Mm?

910
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:54,786
- Do you speak Italian?
- I am Italian!

911
01:12:54,953 --> 01:12:56,621
Sono italiano in spirito.

912
01:12:56,789 --> 01:13:00,666
Ma ho sposato una donna
che preferisce lavorare nel giardino

913
01:13:00,834 --> 01:13:05,546
a far I'amore appassionato.
Uno sbaglio grande!

914
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:08,674
But it's such an ugly language.

915
01:13:08,842 --> 01:13:10,885
How about... Russian?

916
01:13:11,136 --> 01:13:15,306
Yest' sila blagodatnaya
sozvuchiy slov zhivykh.

917
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:22,605
Kamina tozhe ni trudnuyu
tyesnitsya lyubosyat'sya grust'.

918
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:28,152
Odnu molitvu chudnuyu
tverzhdaya naizust'.

919
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:33,950
V dushe kak bremya skatyatsya
somneniya daleko.

920
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:37,954
I varitsya i plachetsya, i tak legko...

921
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:40,498
- Archie?
- Yeah?

922
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:43,334
- Are you rich?
- No. No, I'm afraid not.

923
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,963
- What about the house?
- That's Wendy's. She's the rich one.

924
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:50,508
Oh.

925
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:58,349
Yest' sila blagodatnaya
sozvuchiy slov zhivykh.

926
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:03,855
I tushit nyeponyatnaya,
svetlaya, prelyestnaya rech'.

927
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:08,818
V dushe kak bremya skatyatsya
somneniya daleko.

928
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:13,865
I varitsya i plachetsya, i tak legko!

929
01:14:14,032 --> 01:14:15,867
Leg...

930
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:36,053
- What the hell are you doing?
- I might ask you the same question!

931
01:14:37,681 --> 01:14:39,891
- Who are you?
- What?!

932
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:42,894
- Get your clothes on.
- Will you leave, please?

933
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:45,897
- What?
- You're in the wrong flat.

934
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:48,107
This flat belongs to Patrick Balfour.

935
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:51,861
He's in Hong Kong and
he lent me the key. Now get out!

936
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:54,697
But we leased it from
the agents last weekend.

937
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:04,081
Yes, well, obviously that
changes things a bit. Um...

938
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:07,960
Aren't you Archie Leach?

939
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:09,879
What?

940
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:12,715
You bought our house
in Lissendon Gardens.

941
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:16,427
Hazel and Ian Johnson.

942
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,015
What a coincidence!

943
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:23,935
Ha. How nice to see you.

944
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:57,718
- Hello?
- Hello, Wanda. It's Archie.

945
01:15:57,886 --> 01:16:02,056
Listen... I can't see you any more.
I've got to end it. I'm sorry.

946
01:16:03,016 --> 01:16:04,767
What?

947
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:07,144
I'm sorry.

948
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:10,523
Archie?

949
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:42,179
Uh...

950
01:16:43,223 --> 01:16:45,683
- OK.
- Oh, no, no. Please.

951
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:48,811
- Look, I want to apologize.
- I just finished it.

952
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:51,147
OK, OK. Wait. Where are you going?

953
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:54,859
- I wanna speak with you.
- Will you leave me alone?

954
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:58,362
- Otto, I've just ended it.
- Wait! I wanna say I'm sorry!

955
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:00,531
- It's all over, OK?
- It's all right!

956
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:04,702
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- Will you calm down? Shut up!

957
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,538
- Please believe me!
- It's all right!

958
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:10,249
No, don't beat me up again.
I've had a terrible day.

959
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:13,794
- Will you shut up?!
- Oh, Jesus Christ, don't kill me!

960
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:15,504
Shut up, then.

961
01:17:16,423 --> 01:17:17,882
OK.

962
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:23,679
Look, I just want to apologize,
sincerely, for... What?

963
01:17:23,847 --> 01:17:27,391
Well, when I dangled you
out the window. I'm really, really...

964
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:29,518
It was not a nice thing to do.

965
01:17:29,686 --> 01:17:33,397
Then when I attacked you in there,
well, I'm really, really s...

966
01:17:33,565 --> 01:17:36,984
How could I know you were robbing
your own house? I was trying to help!

967
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:40,946
- Yes. Thanks. Thanks, Otto.
- I wanted you to trust me.

968
01:17:41,114 --> 01:17:44,075
Yeah. Please.
It was my fault. It was my fault.

969
01:17:44,242 --> 01:17:45,701
- That's true.
- Yeah.

970
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:48,162
- Now, about my sister.
- Otto...

971
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,247
Look, she's a very sexy girl.

972
01:17:50,415 --> 01:17:52,958
I understand you wanting
to play around with her.

973
01:17:53,126 --> 01:17:56,504
It's OK. I was wrong.
I'm sorry I was jealous.

974
01:17:56,672 --> 01:18:01,550
Just go ahead.
Pork away, pal. Fuck her blue.

975
01:18:02,302 --> 01:18:05,429
I like you, Archie. I just wanna help.

976
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:13,205
Oh, God!

977
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:52,745
Send for an ambulance!

978
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,725
She copped it!

979
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:21,482
I did it!

980
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:24,568
Unbe-fucking-lievable!

981
01:20:24,736 --> 01:20:26,946
- Thomason!
- Yeah? Oh.

982
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:33,369
You've done well, my son.

983
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:35,412
Now, here's the plan.

984
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:39,542
You get four tickets for this evening
for Rio, first class. Then...

985
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:41,752
f-f-f...

986
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,588
Yeah, four. We get rid of Otto later.

987
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:47,716
Then back to the flat, pack, collect me.

988
01:20:47,884 --> 01:20:51,428
Then to the Cathcart Towers Hotel
to pick up the jewels.

989
01:20:54,599 --> 01:20:59,103
Unbe-fucking-lievable!

990
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:00,521
Oi! Oi!

991
01:21:03,942 --> 01:21:06,610
Oh, it's so exciting!
I can't believe it!

992
01:21:06,778 --> 01:21:08,612
He's s-s-safe.

993
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:11,907
Oh! I'm gonna be late for court.

994
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:16,078
H-Hello. Oh, hello, Otto.

995
01:21:18,456 --> 01:21:21,792
No. She just... left.

996
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,086
Oh, and Otto...

997
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:26,630
You owe me a p-p-p...

998
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:33,387
- What?
- You owe me a p-pound.

999
01:21:35,098 --> 01:21:37,016
Not Granny?

1000
01:21:37,183 --> 01:21:41,437
Met with an accident.

1001
01:21:42,188 --> 01:21:44,273
Bullshit! You're lying!

1002
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:48,652
- Dead?
- Heart attack.

1003
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:57,995
- I don't believe this.
- So George'll be out this afternoon.

1004
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:02,917
We all go up to Heathrow,
collect the loot, and then vvroooom!

1005
01:22:03,084 --> 01:22:08,964
All thanks to me.

1006
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:12,343
So the loot's at the airport,
is it, Ken?

1007
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:25,022
What's h-happening?

1008
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:28,192
Well, Ken...

1009
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:31,862
I'm going to ask you some questions...
while I eat my chips.

1010
01:22:32,864 --> 01:22:34,990
First. Who was the philosopher

1011
01:22:35,158 --> 01:22:40,454
who developed the concept of the
superman in Also sprach Zarathustra?

1012
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:44,458
No?

1013
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:48,045
That's a chip up the nose, I'm afraid.

1014
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:51,090
Friedrich Nietzsche. Next.

1015
01:22:51,257 --> 01:22:55,135
In which book did Nietzsche
claim that almost all higher culture

1016
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:57,054
is based on cruelty?

1017
01:23:00,016 --> 01:23:04,186
- Are you thinking or in mid-stutter?
- You're m-m-mad.

1018
01:23:05,355 --> 01:23:07,564
Beyond Good and Evil.

1019
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:13,237
Guess I'll have to ask you
an easy one, huh, Ken? OK. Um...

1020
01:23:13,905 --> 01:23:16,281
Let me think, let me think. Um...

1021
01:23:16,449 --> 01:23:18,158
Where are the diamonds?

1022
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:23,372
I'll give you a clue.
Somewhere around the airport.

1023
01:23:24,457 --> 01:23:26,417
I'm n-n-n...

1024
01:23:26,584 --> 01:23:28,252
No hassle. There's plenty of time.

1025
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:31,714
I'll just sit here
and eat my chips till you tell me.

1026
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:38,929
The English contribution
to world cuisine: the chip.

1027
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:44,601
What do the English usually eat with
chips to make them more interesting?

1028
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:48,480
Wait a moment!

1029
01:23:49,607 --> 01:23:52,151
It's fish. Isn't it?

1030
01:23:56,781 --> 01:23:58,615
Oh! Here, boy.

1031
01:23:58,783 --> 01:24:01,160
Down the hatch.

1032
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:07,958
- Delicious!
- You b-b-b...

1033
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:11,003
Better eat the green one? OK.

1034
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:13,213
What's this one's name?

1035
01:24:13,506 --> 01:24:17,259
Well, not Wanda, anyway.
I'm going to call her Lunch.

1036
01:24:17,552 --> 01:24:19,845
Hello, Lunch. Hello!

1037
01:24:24,642 --> 01:24:26,602
Eww!

1038
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:29,938
Avoid the green ones.
They're not ripe yet.

1039
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:36,612
Now, you were in court, Inspector,
when the forensic evidence was read?

1040
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:37,988
Yes, sir.

1041
01:24:38,156 --> 01:24:42,034
The fact that Mr. Thomason was
installing windows the previous weekend

1042
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:43,994
would account, would it not, Inspector,

1043
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:47,831
for the presence
of small particles of glass

1044
01:24:47,999 --> 01:24:50,084
on his trousers?

1045
01:24:51,669 --> 01:24:55,005
No hurry, Inspector.
Please do take your time.

1046
01:25:02,138 --> 01:25:04,223
I'm almost full.

1047
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:08,268
- Almost.
- Stop!

1048
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:10,521
Please, don't.

1049
01:25:11,022 --> 01:25:14,233
Come on, Wanda! Gullet time!

1050
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:20,656
What are the names of those hotels
by the airport? What are they?

1051
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:24,201
The Airway Sheraton?
The Post House? The Cathcart Towers?

1052
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:26,578
The Cathcart Towers?! Yes?!

1053
01:25:28,414 --> 01:25:30,749
Mm? Mm?

1054
01:25:31,167 --> 01:25:33,752
- Yes.
- In a safe deposit box?

1055
01:25:34,337 --> 01:25:36,672
- Yes.
- Where's the key?

1056
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,966
- What?
- Where's the key?

1057
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:41,677
It's in the t-t-tank.

1058
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:45,013
Where? Where?

1059
01:25:45,181 --> 01:25:47,182
In the t-t-t...

1060
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:49,226
Treasure chest!

1061
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:55,399
Where?!

1062
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:58,360
Where?

1063
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:04,741
You m-m-murdering...

1064
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:07,202
I'm g-g-gonna k-k-k...

1065
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:09,413
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

1066
01:26:12,375 --> 01:26:15,210
Sorry, Ken,
but your answer was incorrect.

1067
01:26:16,754 --> 01:26:19,715
Still, you really did think
it was in there, didn't you?

1068
01:26:21,676 --> 01:26:23,093
What?

1069
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:25,387
Oh.

1070
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:35,397
- Hello?
- I know where the diamonds are.

1071
01:26:37,525 --> 01:26:39,651
- Where?
- Where's the key?

1072
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:46,867
- I've got it.
- How soon can you get to George's?

1073
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:50,454
You are Wanda Gershwitz,

1074
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:54,583
of Kipling Mansions,
Murray Road, London, West 9?

1075
01:26:55,793 --> 01:26:58,295
- Yes.
- Now, will you tell the court, please,

1076
01:26:58,463 --> 01:27:00,923
how do you know the defendant?

1077
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:03,634
We've had a relationship for two years.

1078
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:06,303
Relationship?

1079
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:09,306
We're lovers, your lord.

1080
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:15,562
Miss Gershwitz,
on the fourth of March of this year,

1081
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:17,814
in the morning, where were you?

1082
01:27:17,982 --> 01:27:21,568
- I was at the apartment at Murray Road.
- Were you by yourself,

1083
01:27:21,736 --> 01:27:24,029
or was there anyone else present?

1084
01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:27,491
- No. Somebody else was there.
- Who was that?

1085
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:30,869
- My brother.
- And did your...?

1086
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:36,500
Your brother?

1087
01:27:38,628 --> 01:27:40,671
My brother.

1088
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:43,298
Yes.

1089
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:49,346
Yes, and...
are you quite sure it was your brother?

1090
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:53,225
Mr. Leach, I'm sure Ms. Gershwitz
can recognize her brother.

1091
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:55,978
She's had a relationship
with him all her life.

1092
01:27:58,314 --> 01:27:59,856
Much obliged, my lord.

1093
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:04,194
Was there anyone else
present that morning?

1094
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:06,280
- George was there.
- Thank you.

1095
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:08,824
- But he left about five to seven.
- Wanda!

1096
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:18,292
I wonder...

1097
01:28:26,884 --> 01:28:28,719
Yes, Mr. Leach?

1098
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:32,139
I Wendy... I Wanda...
I wonder... I w-w-w...

1099
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:35,767
Wh-when you say five to seven,

1100
01:28:35,935 --> 01:28:40,731
Ms. Gershwitz...
how can you be so sure?

1101
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:45,193
Oh, I looked at the clock.
'Cause I was saying to myself,

1102
01:28:45,361 --> 01:28:48,530
"Where could he be going
at five to seven with that shotgun?"

1103
01:28:48,698 --> 01:28:50,699
Darling!

1104
01:28:50,867 --> 01:28:52,868
Mr. Leach. "Darling"?

1105
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:57,539
- Yes, dear?
- You bitch! You fucking bitch!

1106
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:03,503
Restrain that man!

1107
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:12,596
- Restrain this man.
- Come here, you bastard!

1108
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:15,932
Clear the court! I'm adjourning
this matter for an hour.

1109
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:19,061
Clear the court! Clear the court!

1110
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:30,280
Clear the court!
Clear the court! Clear the court!

1111
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:33,158
Officers, arrest that man!

1112
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:41,625
Clear the court! Clear the court!

1113
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:55,138
Bloody hell!

1114
01:29:55,306 --> 01:29:58,308
It's my husband. He's been hit.

1115
01:29:58,476 --> 01:30:01,895
Ah, you made it. Good.
Bit of a knock, I'm afraid.

1116
01:30:03,147 --> 01:30:06,066
I have never been
so humiliated in my life.

1117
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:09,694
You can stick this marriage
right in your bottom!

1118
01:30:09,862 --> 01:30:12,280
I'll see you in court.

1119
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:22,165
Yes.

1120
01:30:23,918 --> 01:30:25,168
Well.

1121
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:27,587
That's it, then.

1122
01:30:31,717 --> 01:30:33,051
- George?
- What?

1123
01:30:33,219 --> 01:30:37,681
- We've got to talk.
- Tell those pigs to fuck off!

1124
01:30:37,849 --> 01:30:39,975
Fuck off, pigs.

1125
01:30:42,019 --> 01:30:44,855
Did you hear what I said? Fuck off.

1126
01:30:50,778 --> 01:30:53,613
- What's she up to, George?
- What are you up to?

1127
01:30:53,781 --> 01:30:57,701
You called her darling... and Wanda.

1128
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:02,289
I've been helping her get her evidence
straight, you burk. It slipped out.

1129
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:04,749
- You been coaching her?
- What do you think?!

1130
01:31:04,917 --> 01:31:08,044
We've got ten minutes.
They're gonna find you guilty, right?

1131
01:31:08,212 --> 01:31:11,548
Plead guilty, tell them where
the loot is, you may get away with...

1132
01:31:11,716 --> 01:31:14,176
...eight years, out in five and a half.

1133
01:31:14,343 --> 01:31:16,761
What if I tell 'em about Otto...
and Wanda?

1134
01:31:17,805 --> 01:31:19,055
- They both did it?
- Yeah.

1135
01:31:19,223 --> 01:31:22,142
Great. All right.
Maybe six years, out in four?

1136
01:31:23,019 --> 01:31:25,061
So where are the diamonds?

1137
01:31:26,272 --> 01:31:30,317
- Where's Bartlett?
- He's upstairs. So, where are they?

1138
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:33,987
Tell Bartlett Ken knows where they are.

1139
01:31:35,406 --> 01:31:38,742
George, it'd be a lot quicker
if you told me.

1140
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:43,079
OK. I'll tell Bartlett.

1141
01:31:43,247 --> 01:31:46,249
- Where's Ken?
- He's at the flat.

1142
01:31:52,381 --> 01:31:56,092
Thank you for all your help.
I'll be right out.

1143
01:32:10,107 --> 01:32:11,608
Taxi! Taxi!

1144
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:12,901
Please. Shit!

1145
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:15,153
- Taxi!
- Come on.

1146
01:32:15,321 --> 01:32:16,446
- What?
- Let's go.

1147
01:32:16,614 --> 01:32:18,073
- Where?
- Buenos Aires.

1148
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:21,409
- What?
- We're going to George's flat first.

1149
01:32:21,577 --> 01:32:23,286
Get in.

1150
01:32:26,624 --> 01:32:28,542
- Got your passport?
- Yeah.

1151
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:31,002
Check the briefcase for mine.

1152
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:33,880
Get your head down.

1153
01:32:38,427 --> 01:32:42,138
So, you robbed the jeweler's,
turned one lover over to the police,

1154
01:32:42,306 --> 01:32:47,143
kept one to help you find the diamonds,
and when he does, you commit perjury.

1155
01:32:47,311 --> 01:32:51,022
- Everybody does it in America.
- Not in this country they don't!

1156
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:54,484
Like nobody lies in England.
Like Margaret Thatcher never lies.

1157
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:58,154
- You lied to me from the start.
- You just wanted to get me into bed.

1158
01:32:58,322 --> 01:33:00,156
I fell in love with you!

1159
01:33:06,163 --> 01:33:07,998
How come you dumped me, then?

1160
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,501
I wasn't rich enough. Remember?

1161
01:33:23,139 --> 01:33:25,390
- Say something in Russian.
- No!

1162
01:33:30,688 --> 01:33:33,773
- What are you thinking?
- I'm trying to think of a reason

1163
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:36,359
why I should take you
to South America with me.

1164
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:41,948
How about... because I have
the key to the safety deposit box?

1165
01:33:43,743 --> 01:33:45,452
- That's a good reason!
- Good reason.

1166
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:52,375
- What do we do about Otto?
- I'll handle Otto.

1167
01:33:52,543 --> 01:33:54,794
Be careful, he's dangerous.

1168
01:33:54,962 --> 01:33:56,963
So am I.

1169
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:59,215
Keep it running.

1170
01:34:01,761 --> 01:34:03,386
Why'd you bring him?

1171
01:34:03,554 --> 01:34:06,348
- No!
- I'm beginning to think you like him!

1172
01:34:06,515 --> 01:34:07,682
Let's get the diamonds!

1173
01:34:08,559 --> 01:34:09,851
Ken?

1174
01:34:10,019 --> 01:34:12,062
Are you Ke...?

1175
01:34:13,773 --> 01:34:16,274
How do you do? I'm George's barrister.

1176
01:34:17,193 --> 01:34:19,486
What's happened?

1177
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:22,364
- Oh, my God...
- Asshole!

1178
01:34:23,282 --> 01:34:25,617
What the bloody hell do you think...?

1179
01:34:25,785 --> 01:34:27,786
All right, then.

1180
01:34:27,953 --> 01:34:29,746
Archie!

1181
01:34:31,582 --> 01:34:33,917
Where have they gone? Quick!

1182
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:36,753
They've g... They've g... They've g...

1183
01:34:36,921 --> 01:34:38,838
What?

1184
01:34:39,632 --> 01:34:41,925
Are you all right?

1185
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:45,303
- Where have they gone?
- They've gone to the Ca-ca-ca...

1186
01:34:45,471 --> 01:34:47,263
- Are you ill?
- No, no, no.

1187
01:34:47,431 --> 01:34:49,432
- What?
- The Ca-ca-ca...

1188
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,269
- Have you got a stutter?
- Y-y-yeah. A b-b-bit.

1189
01:34:53,437 --> 01:34:57,482
OK, fine. Don't worry, don't worry.
Do you know where they've gone?

1190
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:59,901
- Y-y-y...
- Fine, fine. Where?

1191
01:35:00,945 --> 01:35:02,904
The Ca...

1192
01:35:03,072 --> 01:35:04,823
Hotel.

1193
01:35:04,990 --> 01:35:07,117
Hotel? Which hotel?

1194
01:35:08,953 --> 01:35:10,495
Ca...

1195
01:35:10,663 --> 01:35:12,622
The Ca... The Ca...

1196
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:14,290
- The...
- Go on.

1197
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:16,042
Ca-ca-ca...

1198
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:19,212
All right. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1199
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:21,506
Slowly. Very slowly.

1200
01:35:22,049 --> 01:35:23,675
Slowly.

1201
01:35:25,594 --> 01:35:26,970
The C...

1202
01:35:27,763 --> 01:35:29,222
The Ca...

1203
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:32,976
The C...

1204
01:35:33,144 --> 01:35:34,352
The Ca...

1205
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:37,355
- No hurry.
- The C-C-Ca...

1206
01:35:37,523 --> 01:35:40,442
- Sing it. Sing.
- The Ca...

1207
01:35:41,652 --> 01:35:44,779
The Ca... The Ca... The Ca...

1208
01:35:46,866 --> 01:35:48,742
- Ca...
- Plenty of time.

1209
01:35:48,909 --> 01:35:50,827
Ca...

1210
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:53,121
Ca... The Ca...

1211
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:55,999
Oh, come on! Sorry. I'm sorry.

1212
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:58,752
Um... All right, wait.

1213
01:35:58,919 --> 01:36:01,004
The Ca... The...

1214
01:36:03,549 --> 01:36:05,633
Here. Write it.

1215
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:19,314
- Cathcart Towers Hotel?
- Cathcart Towers Hotel.

1216
01:36:19,482 --> 01:36:21,900
Where is it?

1217
01:36:22,067 --> 01:36:23,943
Ken, where is it? Where?!

1218
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:26,196
He-He-He...

1219
01:36:26,363 --> 01:36:28,198
Here. Here. Again. No?

1220
01:36:35,956 --> 01:36:36,956
Heathrow Airport.

1221
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:50,220
Hey!

1222
01:36:50,387 --> 01:36:52,055
What's the idea? You can't stay...

1223
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:54,474
Frightfully sorry. Take it, it's yours.

1224
01:37:02,525 --> 01:37:05,527
Thank you so much.
Uh... British Airways to Rio?

1225
01:37:05,694 --> 01:37:08,446
- Rio? Terminal Four, sir.
- Thank you.

1226
01:37:15,287 --> 01:37:17,080
Excuse me, sir. Is this your vehicle?

1227
01:37:17,248 --> 01:37:19,290
With you in a moment.
I'll be right back.

1228
01:37:21,377 --> 01:37:23,795
Aisle or window?
Smoking or nonsmoking?

1229
01:37:24,713 --> 01:37:27,590
- What was the middle one?
- Anything in nonsmoking.

1230
01:37:27,758 --> 01:37:30,218
Gate 14 is boarding now.

1231
01:37:52,533 --> 01:37:53,908
Rio!

1232
01:37:55,077 --> 01:37:57,912
Otto, don't look back.
There's a cop right behind us.

1233
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:59,998
Quick!

1234
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:06,546
- Yes, we can just do it, Mr. Leach.
- Great.

1235
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:08,506
Luggage?

1236
01:38:11,635 --> 01:38:13,511
Don't really need any.

1237
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:15,096
- Gate 14.
- Thank you.

1238
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:19,267
Ciao, stupidissimo.

1239
01:38:49,381 --> 01:38:52,050
Come on, Archie. Pick up the phone.

1240
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:03,019
Sir! Airport security.
May I see your boarding pass, please?

1241
01:39:03,187 --> 01:39:05,271
Oh, yes. Certainly, certainly.

1242
01:39:06,065 --> 01:39:08,608
Very good.
Would you step over here, please?

1243
01:39:08,776 --> 01:39:11,527
- Um, yes, of course.
- Oh, look! The Queen.

1244
01:39:17,117 --> 01:39:20,578
OK, OK, OK, OK.
Don't get excited. OK, OK, OK.

1245
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:25,625
Oh, it's you!
I was actually worried there.

1246
01:39:25,793 --> 01:39:27,502
- Keep your hands up.
- No!

1247
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:29,712
- Put 'em up!
- I'll make a deal with you.

1248
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:33,508
- I'll put one up.
- Put the other one up!

1249
01:39:34,802 --> 01:39:37,053
Which looks better?

1250
01:39:37,221 --> 01:39:39,055
I'm warning you, Otto.

1251
01:39:39,848 --> 01:39:43,726
What are you gonna do? Shoot me?
Gun me down in cold blood like a dog?

1252
01:39:43,894 --> 01:39:47,730
Hey! If you wanna settle something
with me, why don't you fight me?

1253
01:39:47,898 --> 01:39:51,067
You're a man, aren't you?
Let's fight like men! Come on!

1254
01:39:53,028 --> 01:39:55,113
- All right.
- All right, then.

1255
01:39:55,948 --> 01:39:57,865
- OK.
- OK.

1256
01:39:58,951 --> 01:40:02,120
- You look good, Arch.
- I used to box for Oxford.

1257
01:40:02,287 --> 01:40:05,164
Oh, yeah?
Well, I used to kill for the CIA.

1258
01:40:05,332 --> 01:40:07,959
Now, get your hands up.

1259
01:40:08,127 --> 01:40:09,460
No.

1260
01:40:11,338 --> 01:40:14,132
You spineless bimbo.

1261
01:40:14,925 --> 01:40:16,384
Now, out.

1262
01:40:20,889 --> 01:40:23,266
I'm gonna have to shoot you now.

1263
01:40:23,434 --> 01:40:25,977
But I've got a little time
before my plane leaves

1264
01:40:26,145 --> 01:40:29,814
and I'm longing to humiliate you.
So get in that barrel.

1265
01:40:32,818 --> 01:40:35,445
- What?
- In the barrel.

1266
01:40:38,824 --> 01:40:40,742
Right.

1267
01:40:43,203 --> 01:40:46,456
You English, you think
you're so superior, don't you?

1268
01:40:46,749 --> 01:40:49,042
Well, you're the filth of the planet.

1269
01:40:49,209 --> 01:40:53,921
A bunch of pompous,
badly-dressed, poverty-stricken,

1270
01:40:54,089 --> 01:40:56,674
sexually-repressed football hooligans.

1271
01:40:58,802 --> 01:41:00,428
Goodbye, Archie.

1272
01:41:00,971 --> 01:41:03,014
At least we're not irretrievably vulgar.

1273
01:41:03,182 --> 01:41:05,475
You know your problem?
You don't like winners.

1274
01:41:05,642 --> 01:41:07,769
- Winners?
- Yeah.

1275
01:41:07,936 --> 01:41:10,813
- Winners.
- Winners like... North Vietnam?

1276
01:41:10,981 --> 01:41:12,899
Shut up!

1277
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:15,485
We did not lose Vietnam! It was a tie!

1278
01:41:15,652 --> 01:41:18,488
They kicked some ass there.

1279
01:41:18,655 --> 01:41:23,326
Boy, they whupped
your hide real good!

1280
01:41:23,869 --> 01:41:25,453
- No, they didn't.
- Yes, they did.

1281
01:41:25,621 --> 01:41:28,247
- Oh, no, they didn't.
- Oh, yes, they did.

1282
01:41:28,415 --> 01:41:31,042
Oh, no, they... Shut up!

1283
01:41:32,294 --> 01:41:34,837
- Goodbye, Archie.
- Gonna shoot me?

1284
01:41:35,005 --> 01:41:38,508
Uh, yes.
Yes, 'fraid so, old chap. Sorry!

1285
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:40,510
Look, Otto! Look!

1286
01:41:47,893 --> 01:41:49,769
Rev-v-venge!

1287
01:41:53,607 --> 01:41:57,276
It's K-K-Ken, c-c-coming to k-k-kill me.

1288
01:41:58,821 --> 01:42:01,864
How are you gonna
c-c-catch me, K-K-Ken?

1289
01:42:04,284 --> 01:42:06,702
Now, where was I? Oh, yeah.

1290
01:42:08,747 --> 01:42:10,665
Shit! God!

1291
01:42:12,251 --> 01:42:15,503
Stupid fucking limey cement! Ugh!

1292
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:24,720
Ken! Ken!

1293
01:42:24,888 --> 01:42:27,390
Wait. Wait, Ken! Kenny! K...

1294
01:42:27,558 --> 01:42:30,184
- May I call you Kenny?
- Remember Wanda!

1295
01:42:30,352 --> 01:42:33,062
I got the deal of a lifetime!
50-50, you and me. What do you say?

1296
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:37,233
OK, OK, OK. 60-40.
That's my final offer.

1297
01:42:37,401 --> 01:42:40,778
- Revenge!
- Wait. I got an idea. You take it all.

1298
01:42:40,946 --> 01:42:43,614
Yeah. Here's my boarding pass. Ken!

1299
01:42:43,907 --> 01:42:46,409
I'm gonna... I'm gonna k-k-kill you.

1300
01:42:46,577 --> 01:42:49,954
OK, fine. Fine, Ken.
Come at me. Gimme your best shot.

1301
01:42:50,289 --> 01:42:53,499
Go on, Ken!
You don't have the guts. Admit it!

1302
01:42:55,544 --> 01:42:58,421
OK, you have the guts. Good. Wait.

1303
01:42:58,589 --> 01:43:00,089
Death!

1304
01:43:00,257 --> 01:43:03,259
All right. I'm sorry
I ate your fish, OK?

1305
01:43:03,427 --> 01:43:06,345
- I'm sorry!
- Revenge!

1306
01:43:06,513 --> 01:43:08,598
Jesus! I said I'm sorry. What the fu...?

1307
01:43:13,478 --> 01:43:14,854
Got him!

1308
01:43:25,782 --> 01:43:28,451
Got you again! You bastard!

1309
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:32,079
Hey. I've lost my stutter.

1310
01:43:32,247 --> 01:43:35,249
It's gone. I can speak.

1311
01:43:35,417 --> 01:43:37,627
How much wood
could a woodchuck chuck

1312
01:43:37,794 --> 01:43:39,795
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

1313
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:44,425
Oh, good afternoon, sir. Boarding pass?

1314
01:43:52,017 --> 01:43:54,101
Buongiorno, signorina.

1315
01:44:02,778 --> 01:44:04,820
Now, listen. Two things. One...

1316
01:44:06,156 --> 01:44:09,659
Behave yourself from now on,
or I'll break your neck. OK?

1317
01:44:10,661 --> 01:44:11,869
Two...

1318
01:44:13,163 --> 01:44:14,747
Gorbachov.

1319
01:44:14,915 --> 01:44:16,666
Glasnost.

1320
01:44:16,833 --> 01:44:19,335
Molotov.

1321
01:44:19,503 --> 01:44:21,379
Blinis.

1322
01:44:21,546 --> 01:44:23,756
Uh... Lenin.

1323
01:44:24,591 --> 01:44:25,925
Pushkin.

1324
01:44:26,093 --> 01:44:29,512
- Chicken Kiev.
- Good. Dostoyevsky.

1325
01:44:30,931 --> 01:44:32,682
Roubles.

1326
01:44:34,268 --> 01:44:36,060
Vladivostok.

1327
01:44:40,482 --> 01:44:43,192
Assho-o-o-o-o-o-o-ole!
