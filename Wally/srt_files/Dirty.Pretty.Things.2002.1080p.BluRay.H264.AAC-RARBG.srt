00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,306

00:00:51,382 --> 00:00:55,611
traveling to Brussels-Charleroi
on Flight FR-1014.

3
00:00:55,683 --> 00:00:58,376
Please proceed immediately to Departure Gate 6,

4
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,916
where this flight is now closing.

5
00:01:00,984 --> 00:01:04,746
Do you want a car?
£ 10, Theatreland.

6
00:01:04,817 --> 00:01:06,942
Car? London?

7
00:01:14,052 --> 00:01:16,449
You want a taxi?

8
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,848
Buckingham Palace.

9
00:01:24,153 --> 00:01:25,642
No one.

10
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,982
Would you like a car, sir?

11
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,916
Are you from Sajit?

12
00:01:30,787 --> 00:01:32,548
I'm not here to meet you in particular.

13
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:33,744
I am here to rescue those

14
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,309
that have been let down by the system.

15
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,013
Okay.
Let's go.

16
00:01:38,088 --> 00:01:39,678
I'm over there.

17
00:02:30,626 --> 00:02:33,253
- Who's next?
- 2-9.

18
00:02:37,794 --> 00:02:39,851
Here.
My turn.

19
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:41,993
Okay.

20
00:02:42,627 --> 00:02:43,787
Hey.

21
00:02:46,928 --> 00:02:48,588
Your name is now Mohammed.

22
00:02:48,662 --> 00:02:51,595
Thank you, Okwe.

23
00:03:01,563 --> 00:03:04,792
Hurry up, now, man.
Come quick, quick, quick, quick.

24
00:03:04,864 --> 00:03:06,330
Quick, now.

25
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:09,797
Right.
You just come here.

26
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:27,497
That bitch.

27
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:30,657
This shit, dustbin city.

28
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:33,631
So, what do I need, Okwe?

29
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:35,393
Amoxicillin.

30
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:37,696
You get that in Boots drugstore or not?

31
00:03:37,768 --> 00:03:39,825
- From a doctor.
- You're a doctor.

32
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,764
I'm a driver.

33
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:43,927
Look.

34
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:46,433
They say you're a doctor, right?

35
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:47,933
You get me something now.

36
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:50,297
I can't piss fire another day, man.

37
00:03:50,368 --> 00:03:52,027
I'm a driver.

38
00:03:52,102 --> 00:03:55,398
It's for me wife's sake.
You know what I mean.

39
00:03:56,902 --> 00:03:58,062
Okay.

40
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:01,591
So I'll get you all the jobs in South London.

41
00:04:02,937 --> 00:04:05,597
Okay.
I'll see what I can do.

42
00:04:05,671 --> 00:04:06,898
Let me kiss you, Okwe.

43
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:09,835
Maybe in return,
you can get some soap.

44
00:04:26,607 --> 00:04:30,095
Early is as bad as late, Okwe.

45
00:05:04,743 --> 00:05:06,936
Hello.
Front desk.

46
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,171
No, I'm afraid the kitchen
is closed from midnight.

47
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:14,009
I'm sorry.

48
00:05:14,077 --> 00:05:16,202
Good night, madam.

49
00:05:16,277 --> 00:05:17,801
Good night, madam.

50
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:06,512
What?

51
00:06:06,585 --> 00:06:08,573
Senay, perhaps today,
I can cook you lunch.

52
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,344
No, Okwe.

53
00:06:15,785 --> 00:06:17,684
So that's true what they say.

54
00:06:17,786 --> 00:06:19,045
What is true?

55
00:06:19,084 --> 00:06:22,778
They say you and the Turkish
girl are nesting like birds.

56
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:24,785
I rent her couch.

57
00:06:24,853 --> 00:06:27,513
In the morning,
when she's working here.

58
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,108
We're never there at the same time.

59
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:31,583
She has rules.

60
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:35,347
You know, she's a Muslim,
which means she's a virgin.

61
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:37,080
Like a little angel.

62
00:06:37,154 --> 00:06:39,882
Ivan, I think there's someone at the door.

63
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:45,414
Can you believe it?

64
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,955
One of the fuckers wanted to
put me on his Visa card!

65
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:50,146
Oh, my bloomin' feet.

66
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:52,519
Lucky I don't work standing up.

67
00:06:56,088 --> 00:06:57,748
What?

68
00:06:57,822 --> 00:07:00,449
Don't they have hookers where you come from?

69
00:07:00,524 --> 00:07:02,251
Where are you from?

70
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,385
Somewhere with lions, I bet.

71
00:07:09,258 --> 00:07:10,985
I like lions.

72
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,885
Right.

73
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:15,788
Oh, yeah.

74
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:18,722
You might want to send
someone to check on the room.

75
00:07:18,824 --> 00:07:21,451
- There is a problem?
- How should I know?

76
00:07:21,493 --> 00:07:24,652
I don't exist, do I?

77
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:26,486
See you tomorrow.

78
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:25,824
What's that?

79
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,057
You're stealing stuff already, huh?

80
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,928
Guy before you used to steal
whole pigs from the freezer.

81
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:34,930
But you better hide it.

82
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:36,691
If Sneaky sees that...

83
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:39,922
Speak of the fucking devil!

84
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,760
Where's the greeter here?

85
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,665
This fucking place.

86
00:10:06,501 --> 00:10:07,990
Hey!

87
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:10,899
Instead of smoking,
you clean this place up.

88
00:10:48,174 --> 00:10:51,072
Okwe.
Everything is all right?

89
00:10:54,441 --> 00:10:56,497
What's this?
Lunch?

90
00:10:56,573 --> 00:11:01,371
It was blocking the lavatory in Room 510.

91
00:11:01,442 --> 00:11:03,067
It is a heart.

92
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,735
A human heart.

93
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:07,206
What?

94
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:10,036
What the fuck do you know about hearts, Okwe?

95
00:11:10,108 --> 00:11:13,041
Perhaps you should telephone the police.

96
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:17,739
Police? You think I should call the police?

97
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,368
Señor Juan, someone is dead.

98
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:23,876
Okay.
You speak to them.

99
00:11:23,943 --> 00:11:27,570
You found it.
You do the talking.

100
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,507
I'll introduce you.

101
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:35,475
What's your full name, Okwe?

102
00:11:36,844 --> 00:11:38,835
And you never told me where you're from.

103
00:11:38,913 --> 00:11:43,242
Or even how come you're here
in this beautiful country.

104
00:11:43,312 --> 00:11:45,574
Hello? Police?

105
00:11:45,647 --> 00:11:48,237
Yeah, got somebody who wants to talk to you.

106
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,708
Hello?

107
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,075
Hello?

108
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,272
Hello?

109
00:11:57,313 --> 00:11:59,143
You will learn, Okwe.

110
00:11:59,214 --> 00:12:02,738
The hotel business is about strangers.

111
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:06,747
And strangers will always
surprise you, you know?

112
00:12:06,816 --> 00:12:11,873
They come to hotels in the night
to do dirty things.

113
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:13,039
And in the morning,

114
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:16,207
it's our job to make things look pretty again.

115
00:12:16,283 --> 00:12:18,011
For your trouble.

116
00:12:19,882 --> 00:12:22,905
You think if you don't take
the money, you are innocent?

117
00:12:22,983 --> 00:12:26,041
Take it.
Do something nice with it.

118
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,106
No.

119
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,954
It came to me last night
in a flash of inspiration.

120
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:08,553
I can see.

121
00:14:08,628 --> 00:14:10,059
That's a good move.

122
00:14:11,428 --> 00:14:14,326
Guo Yi,
there's something I need.

123
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,090
Amoxicillin.

124
00:14:16,163 --> 00:14:17,924
You got the clap?

125
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:19,825
No.

126
00:14:19,896 --> 00:14:20,953
My boss.

127
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,291
Which one?

128
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:23,954
They're all the same.

129
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:28,292
In this country,
the health service is free.

130
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:31,296
You still driving cabs in the day?

131
00:14:32,063 --> 00:14:34,530
You're going to kill yourself.

132
00:14:34,597 --> 00:14:36,757
I do not care to sleep.

133
00:14:39,498 --> 00:14:43,488
When you go quiet,
it means you've won already.

134
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:45,429
Go on, Okwe.
Don't be nice.

135
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:47,295
Makes it worse.

136
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,923
Well, shit.

137
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,125
You want Chinese or English tea?

138
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,257
Chinese.

139
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:00,266
Don't know how you drink that stuff.

140
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:04,232
I found it on a body.
It's blown my head wide open.

141
00:15:04,301 --> 00:15:05,927
You should read it.

142
00:15:06,001 --> 00:15:08,796
Medicine for your soul, Okwe.

143
00:15:11,068 --> 00:15:13,762
Guo Yi, today I also found something.

144
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:17,993
In a lavatory in one of the hotel rooms.

145
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:20,298
Someone's heart.

146
00:15:21,869 --> 00:15:23,564
A heart.

147
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:25,864
A human heart.

148
00:15:25,936 --> 00:15:29,596
I'm only telling you
because you are a rational man.

149
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,432
Maybe there's an explanation.

150
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:42,170
Maybe some guy with one
of the girls had a heart attack.

151
00:15:42,238 --> 00:15:43,704
Rooms are down as empty.

152
00:15:43,772 --> 00:15:46,431
So the Spanish guy had to get rid of the body.

153
00:15:46,505 --> 00:15:48,097
Hotels hate dead people.

154
00:15:48,173 --> 00:15:49,661
- It was a healthy heart.
- So?

155
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:51,534
So your boss was right first time.

156
00:15:51,606 --> 00:15:53,300
Somebody brought it with them.

157
00:15:53,373 --> 00:15:55,805
- Who carries human organs?
- Lots of people.

158
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:58,272
- Name someone.
- Me. Okay? Me.

159
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,897
I do it all the time.
I take my work home.

160
00:16:01,973 --> 00:16:05,498
What I'm saying is,
I could if I was weird.

161
00:16:05,574 --> 00:16:07,938
And this is a weird city.

162
00:16:09,308 --> 00:16:12,298
Why would anyone do that to a human heart?

163
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,670
These sound to me like questions.

164
00:16:14,742 --> 00:16:17,573
I don't ask questions after 11 years here.

165
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:19,608
And I'm a certified refugee.

166
00:16:19,676 --> 00:16:23,506
You're an illegal, Okwe.
You don't have a position here.

167
00:16:23,576 --> 00:16:26,633
You have nothing.
You are nothing.

168
00:16:27,843 --> 00:16:31,241
You wait outside.
I'll go get you those pills.

169
00:16:33,311 --> 00:16:36,334
Stick to helping people who can be helped.

170
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:54,507
Fresh stuff.

171
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,068
Thank you.

172
00:16:56,146 --> 00:16:57,545
Thank you.

173
00:17:25,249 --> 00:17:26,875
Senay.

174
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,415
Senay.

175
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:32,478
Senay, having only one key
is making this impossible.

176
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,709
I do not want you coming in when I am there.

177
00:17:34,784 --> 00:17:36,215
At the hotel, we are friends!

178
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:38,613
- I'm no different here.

179
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:40,913
How would it look, Okwe?

180
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:44,075
So it is better I always
chase you down the street?

181
00:17:44,952 --> 00:17:48,646
Wait five minutes,
then knock the door.

182
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:51,276
Knock very, very quietly.

183
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,878
Senay!

184
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:11,581
Yes?

185
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:15,486
Did you clean on the fifth floor
yesterday morning?

186
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:25,284
Nothing works.

187
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:28,114
Senay, did you clean Room 510 yesterday?

188
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,850
What the hell are you talking
about the hotel for?

189
00:18:31,924 --> 00:18:34,151
Water, water, water!

190
00:18:34,224 --> 00:18:37,214
I was wondering if there was
a problem in 510 yesterday.

191
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,449
You can fix these things?

192
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:42,619
Okwe!

193
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:45,913
You can fix...

194
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:49,824
They were not clean.
Glasses need very hot water.

195
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:51,018
So do women.

196
00:18:51,093 --> 00:18:54,525
Everything here is connected
to everything else.

197
00:18:56,493 --> 00:19:00,892
Okwe, in Africa, it is the man
who will cook and clean?

198
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:04,920
Senay, this came for you.

199
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:08,958
Why did you not tell me?

200
00:19:09,027 --> 00:19:11,017
I just told you.

201
00:19:14,595 --> 00:19:16,959
You have friends in New York?

202
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:22,190
Your postcard.

203
00:19:22,263 --> 00:19:23,923
I have a cousin.

204
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:26,825
Ever since I was small,
she has written to me.

205
00:19:26,863 --> 00:19:29,227
I sometimes wish London was more like New York.

206
00:19:29,297 --> 00:19:31,263
It would be easier to drive a cab there.

207
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,888
You have been to New York?

208
00:19:35,364 --> 00:19:36,420
And you came back?

209
00:19:36,497 --> 00:19:38,622
I lived there for a time.

210
00:19:40,164 --> 00:19:43,324
In the winter,
they put lights in the trees.

211
00:19:43,397 --> 00:19:45,489
Is that true?

212
00:19:45,565 --> 00:19:47,656
And you can skate in the parks.

213
00:19:47,732 --> 00:19:51,164
And some of the policemen ride white horses.

214
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,357
Not all of them, but some.

215
00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:57,057
What did you do there?

216
00:19:57,132 --> 00:19:58,893
I worked in a hospital.

217
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:02,025
- You were a cleaner?
- I was there to study.

218
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,294
So, why are you working in a hotel?

219
00:20:04,368 --> 00:20:06,561
It is an African story.

220
00:20:07,735 --> 00:20:11,359
I've noticed you never answer 'yes' or 'no.'

221
00:20:11,434 --> 00:20:13,764
You are very strange.

222
00:20:15,536 --> 00:20:17,228
You drink wine, Senay?

223
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:19,426
Do you want to know why I left Turkey?

224
00:20:19,502 --> 00:20:21,469
Because you wanted to live like your cousin.

225
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:22,127
No.

226
00:20:22,203 --> 00:20:25,294
Because I do not want to live like my mother.

227
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,260
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

228
00:20:28,336 --> 00:20:30,427
I do drink wine.

229
00:20:49,273 --> 00:20:52,136
This is a recipe from Nigeria.

230
00:20:52,206 --> 00:20:55,603
In Nigeria, they do many
interesting things with pork.

231
00:20:59,207 --> 00:21:02,173
But, of course, I used lamb.

232
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,133
Take one three times a day.

233
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:20,641
Avoid alcohol.

234
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:22,767
In here. Come.

235
00:21:41,445 --> 00:21:43,570
So she's a popular lady.

236
00:21:43,645 --> 00:21:47,270
My warriors cannot work
with rotten balls, Okwe.

237
00:21:47,345 --> 00:21:51,938
My friend is just a porter
in the hospital crematorium.

238
00:22:04,514 --> 00:22:06,208
Hello.
Front desk.

239
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:08,941
No, I'm afraid the kitchen
is closed from midnight.

240
00:22:09,015 --> 00:22:10,378
Hey!

241
00:22:12,481 --> 00:22:13,946
Hello?

242
00:22:14,716 --> 00:22:16,579
Yeah, room service.

243
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,239
Sneaky doesn't know about this?

244
00:22:28,315 --> 00:22:31,248
Sneaky knows about everything.

245
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:32,975
And you?

246
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:35,141
You know everything that goes on in the hotel?

247
00:22:35,216 --> 00:22:37,080
Not so much butter!
Hey.

248
00:22:38,683 --> 00:22:40,775
You guard the door, lvan.

249
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,510
You see who comes and goes.

250
00:22:43,584 --> 00:22:45,812
You would know if somebody came into the hotel

251
00:22:45,885 --> 00:22:47,647
but did not leave again.

252
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:51,379
Why would someone not leave, Okwe?

253
00:22:54,086 --> 00:22:55,346
I don't know.

254
00:22:55,418 --> 00:22:59,351
You should remove the crusts,
like in the Ritz.

255
00:23:00,852 --> 00:23:03,183
Everyone leaves, Okwe.

256
00:23:03,253 --> 00:23:04,981
Some leave quickly.

257
00:23:05,053 --> 00:23:08,178
Some stay for long time.

258
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,152
If you want to stay,

259
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:15,085
don't concern yourself
with who comes and who goes.

260
00:23:17,722 --> 00:23:21,655
It's the little touches
that make the difference.

261
00:23:21,723 --> 00:23:23,984
That's capitalism.

262
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,215
Now go.

263
00:23:25,256 --> 00:23:29,586
Don't forget.
You accept only cash.

264
00:23:31,489 --> 00:23:33,080
Room service.

265
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:37,022
Thanks.

266
00:24:34,998 --> 00:24:38,895
Okay, you just make
yourself comfortable, and, uh...

267
00:24:38,963 --> 00:24:39,952
I'll go freshen up.

268
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:41,553
All right?

269
00:24:44,465 --> 00:24:48,056
Fucking asshole.

270
00:24:57,332 --> 00:24:58,922
Oh, my God.

271
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,828
Come on, babe. Hurry up.

272
00:25:05,368 --> 00:25:07,027
Okay, okay.

273
00:25:08,368 --> 00:25:11,162
Calm yourself, sweetheart.

274
00:25:12,668 --> 00:25:14,634
What are you doing?

275
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,497
Have a drink first.

276
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:19,467
You look fine.
Just get out here.

277
00:25:22,035 --> 00:25:24,298
Hey.

278
00:25:24,402 --> 00:25:25,333
Hey.

279
00:25:26,537 --> 00:25:28,025
Fuck!

280
00:25:41,105 --> 00:25:43,036
Enough. No more.

281
00:25:43,105 --> 00:25:44,594
Where the fuck did you come from?

282
00:25:44,671 --> 00:25:46,000
Leave now!

283
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,900
Oh! Oh, fuck!

284
00:25:56,573 --> 00:25:58,095
You don't have concussion.

285
00:25:58,172 --> 00:26:00,138
How the fuck do you know?

286
00:26:00,207 --> 00:26:02,331
Christ, you must be bored.

287
00:26:02,406 --> 00:26:04,167
Getting your kicks spying on me.

288
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:07,672
I was making sure the blockage
had not returned.

289
00:26:07,741 --> 00:26:09,331
Perhaps...

290
00:26:09,407 --> 00:26:10,895
It's Juliette.

291
00:26:10,973 --> 00:26:12,530
You should go home and rest.

292
00:26:12,607 --> 00:26:13,937
Rest?

293
00:26:14,008 --> 00:26:16,337
Got three more before morning.

294
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:20,101
So, have you ever seen a lion?

295
00:26:20,174 --> 00:26:22,197
Oh, yes.

296
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:23,901
On TV.

297
00:26:46,311 --> 00:26:48,335
I had it cut.

298
00:26:48,411 --> 00:26:50,274
It is yours.

299
00:26:51,546 --> 00:26:54,944
You were right.
This way is more sensible.

300
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:13,946
Okwe, you must not tell them at
the hotel that you have a key.

301
00:27:14,015 --> 00:27:15,844
Senay, I tell them only the truth.

302
00:27:15,915 --> 00:27:17,005
Even so.

303
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,014
And show them that your back hurts

304
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,775
so they know you sleep on the floor.

305
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:22,973
But that is not true.
I sleep on the couch.

306
00:27:23,081 --> 00:27:26,912
The couch is not as real as the floor, Okwe.

307
00:27:26,948 --> 00:27:28,471
Believe me.
I'm a woman.

308
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:31,482
And some of those bitches
won't know what is a couch.

309
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,811
But they know floor.
They clean floors.

310
00:27:36,616 --> 00:27:37,548
For you?

311
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:39,980
Immigration-enforcement directive.

312
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,573
Open the door.

313
00:27:54,653 --> 00:27:56,050
Forgive us.
Miss Gelik?

314
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,847
Senay Gelik?
Turkish national?

315
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,010
- Do you have your S.A.L. Handy?
- My what?

316
00:28:00,085 --> 00:28:01,847
Your acknowledgement letter.
Your I.D.

317
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,682
Oh, yeah.
I carry it always.

318
00:28:04,754 --> 00:28:07,083
Neighbors, Senay.
They see things.

319
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:10,244
In the last few days, they've
seen someone come and go.

320
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,786
A man.

321
00:28:12,454 --> 00:28:15,544
Sometimes a woman in your
position can be exploited.

322
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,519
There are people in London
without any kind of papers.

323
00:28:18,588 --> 00:28:20,782
- They prey on people like you.
- Prey?

324
00:28:20,854 --> 00:28:23,879
- There is someone living here.
- There is no one living here.

325
00:28:23,988 --> 00:28:26,114
You are aware that your E.L.R. Status

326
00:28:26,155 --> 00:28:27,849
means you are unable to accept rent.

327
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:30,081
You're seeking asylum.

328
00:28:30,155 --> 00:28:33,713
Or engage in employment of any
kind for at least six months.

329
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:36,779
- You're not working, are you?
- Mind if I use your bathroom?

330
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:40,185
Your case is under review.

331
00:29:06,426 --> 00:29:08,393
Thank you.

332
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,085
Thank you.

333
00:29:11,561 --> 00:29:12,992
Is that all you want?

334
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,821
No, no, no, no.

335
00:29:16,562 --> 00:29:19,120
You know this stuff will
not only keep you awake.

336
00:29:19,195 --> 00:29:21,854
It'll blow your brains out.
You know that, don't you?

337
00:29:30,795 --> 00:29:33,490
Hey! Okwe!

338
00:29:34,196 --> 00:29:36,856
Keys.
There you are.

339
00:29:36,931 --> 00:29:39,158
Hey, Okwe.
What happened, man?

340
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,355
Hey, somebody's husband came home early, right?

341
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,488
Here.
Take this.

342
00:29:43,565 --> 00:29:47,395
We don't want the doctor getting sick, right?

343
00:29:54,198 --> 00:29:56,960
I played them one of these fellows' songs.

344
00:29:57,033 --> 00:29:59,465
And, actually,
they were very helpful.

345
00:29:59,532 --> 00:30:01,658
Had they already heard it or not?

346
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:06,226
They were already very into funk and...

347
00:30:07,866 --> 00:30:09,833
It's bound to happen.

348
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:12,026
You stay here too long.

349
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,157
You start dressing like an Englishman, huh?

350
00:30:35,902 --> 00:30:37,801
Where is he, then?

351
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:38,837
Who?

352
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:42,528
I have a date.
Every payday, 4:45.

353
00:30:42,603 --> 00:30:44,468
Hey!

354
00:30:44,537 --> 00:30:46,128
Come on, lover boy.

355
00:30:46,204 --> 00:30:48,500
Okwe, will you help me?

356
00:30:48,572 --> 00:30:50,697
Hey, guy before you took £5.

357
00:30:50,771 --> 00:30:51,738
No, no, no, no.

358
00:30:51,804 --> 00:30:54,397
- But you watch the door, huh?
- Yes.

359
00:30:54,472 --> 00:30:55,732
Come, my little princess.

360
00:30:55,805 --> 00:30:58,270
Come, come, come, come,
lille princesso.

361
00:30:58,338 --> 00:31:02,669
Security room is out of bounds
for half an hour.

362
00:31:02,739 --> 00:31:06,603
Five minutes, max.

363
00:31:06,674 --> 00:31:09,572
Immigration-enforcement directive.

364
00:31:17,774 --> 00:31:19,502
Can I help you?

365
00:31:22,942 --> 00:31:25,374
What time do the maids clock in?

366
00:31:27,275 --> 00:31:29,741
- Wakey-wakey.
- 5:00.

367
00:31:32,042 --> 00:31:34,373
You mind if we wait?

368
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:36,799
No.

369
00:31:54,711 --> 00:31:57,406
Excuse me, sir.
This is a nonsmoking area.

370
00:31:57,479 --> 00:31:59,171
If you wish,
perhaps you can wait

371
00:31:59,245 --> 00:32:01,905
in the designated area across the lobby.

372
00:32:34,949 --> 00:32:36,279
Hello?

373
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:40,875
It's for you.

374
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,849
Hello?

375
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:45,145
Okwe. Okwe!

376
00:32:45,217 --> 00:32:47,273
But I am almost there!

377
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:50,805
Senay will be here in two minutes.

378
00:32:50,884 --> 00:32:52,579
You must stop her.

379
00:33:58,158 --> 00:34:01,420
I have a medical condition.

380
00:34:01,492 --> 00:34:04,220
Lightning doesn't strike twice!

381
00:34:19,194 --> 00:34:21,854
Is that the last of them?

382
00:34:21,928 --> 00:34:23,588
Yes.

383
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,990
This is an interesting place.

384
00:34:27,061 --> 00:34:29,585
Would you like to see a rate card?

385
00:34:50,498 --> 00:34:51,723
I have a friend.

386
00:34:51,797 --> 00:34:54,263
In her factory,
they always need people.

387
00:34:54,331 --> 00:34:56,195
It's a sweatshop.

388
00:34:56,264 --> 00:34:59,356
Is it any worse than cleaning up after whores?

389
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:01,261
It's better money.

390
00:35:03,231 --> 00:35:05,925
Oh, you are so sad for me.

391
00:35:05,999 --> 00:35:08,228
I do not wish to cause harm to anyone.

392
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,629
That is all it is?

393
00:35:09,699 --> 00:35:11,461
I will collect my things and go.

394
00:35:11,533 --> 00:35:13,624
- Go?
- How can I stay?

395
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,394
Okwe, who will cook for me?

396
00:35:17,434 --> 00:35:20,696
If it's okay, I will call on you
if I have the time.

397
00:35:20,768 --> 00:35:23,495
But I'm owed three days' money by the hotel.

398
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:26,398
I will see Señor Juan tomorrow morning.

399
00:35:26,435 --> 00:35:29,196
I have no money for food.

400
00:35:29,268 --> 00:35:33,257
I will see him today.
Meet me at the café at 4:00.

401
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:16,496
You are here to see Señor Juan?

402
00:36:19,506 --> 00:36:21,235
Looking for work?

403
00:36:25,008 --> 00:36:27,803
Are you working?

404
00:36:27,874 --> 00:36:29,464
French?

405
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:31,734
No, no.

406
00:36:31,808 --> 00:36:34,799
Help me.

407
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:38,239
Yoruba.
You speak Yoruba?

408
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,969
Bantu?

409
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:44,971
What the fuck are you doing here, Okwe?

410
00:36:45,044 --> 00:36:46,508
Senay has decided to leave.

411
00:36:46,577 --> 00:36:48,667
She asked me to collect what she's owed.

412
00:36:48,744 --> 00:36:49,675
Oh, yeah?

413
00:36:49,744 --> 00:36:52,677
What, are you marrying her or something, Okwe?

414
00:36:55,478 --> 00:36:57,411
I'll get her money.

415
00:37:08,412 --> 00:37:10,901
No, no! It's okay.
I'm a doctor.

416
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,241
I'm a doctor.
It's okay.

417
00:37:13,313 --> 00:37:17,803
No, no, no.
Please, please, please.

418
00:37:23,863 --> 00:37:25,796
You must get this man to hospital now.

419
00:37:25,863 --> 00:37:27,160
He must go straightaway.

420
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,459
If you are a doctor,
you can do something.

421
00:37:29,532 --> 00:37:32,055
This is the wound of an operation.

422
00:37:32,132 --> 00:37:34,790
Where? Where did he have this operation?

423
00:37:34,864 --> 00:37:36,422
Which country?

424
00:37:36,498 --> 00:37:38,522
You must get this man to hospital!

425
00:37:38,598 --> 00:37:40,292
They won't go to hospital.

426
00:37:40,366 --> 00:37:42,457
- No, no!
- No hospital!

427
00:38:04,234 --> 00:38:06,030
Guo Yi is here?

428
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,356
Shit.

429
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:26,528
Sister. Hello.
It's my first day here.

430
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,332
I was told to collect my overall.

431
00:38:28,405 --> 00:38:30,428
- Which shift are you on?
- Shift?

432
00:38:30,505 --> 00:38:34,096
Come on. Either you're late
or you're really late.

433
00:39:32,512 --> 00:39:34,478
You couldn't do the bins in the kitchen

434
00:39:34,546 --> 00:39:36,535
when you're done in here,
could you?

435
00:40:42,953 --> 00:40:45,578
Okay, okay, okay.

436
00:40:46,853 --> 00:40:48,786
You see these blue tablets?

437
00:40:48,853 --> 00:40:51,615
He must take two every two hours.

438
00:40:51,687 --> 00:40:53,176
Understand?

439
00:40:53,254 --> 00:40:56,686
He must take two blue tablets every two hours.

440
00:41:06,622 --> 00:41:09,020
You speak English?

441
00:41:09,088 --> 00:41:10,384
And Somali?

442
00:41:10,455 --> 00:41:11,648
A bit.

443
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:18,845
He says to say, 'Thank you.
God is great.'

444
00:41:19,424 --> 00:41:22,583
Tell them he must take two
blue tablets every two hours.

445
00:41:28,658 --> 00:41:31,147
And one white tablet every six hours.

446
00:41:35,258 --> 00:41:38,247
It is very important
that you get this exactly right.

447
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:46,890
Ask him which hospital they went
to to have the kidney removed.

448
00:41:52,227 --> 00:41:54,750
He says they didn't go to a hospital.

449
00:41:54,827 --> 00:41:57,123
Ask him where they did this.

450
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:02,493
In a room.

451
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:05,528
He had his kidney removed in the hotel, yes?

452
00:42:06,495 --> 00:42:08,723
How much did he get for risking his life?

453
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,689
He is English now.

454
00:42:15,763 --> 00:42:18,356
He swapped his insides for a passport?

455
00:42:24,363 --> 00:42:26,023
The man at the hotel said

456
00:42:26,097 --> 00:42:28,529
it would be like taking out a tooth.

457
00:43:06,035 --> 00:43:09,025
- Can I get you something?
- I've been here one hour.

458
00:43:09,102 --> 00:43:11,159
An hour and a half.

459
00:43:15,636 --> 00:43:16,898
There.

460
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:19,367
I will go and collect my things.

461
00:43:20,971 --> 00:43:23,027
Why won't you sit down?

462
00:43:29,804 --> 00:43:32,032
- Okwe, where have you been?
- Africa.

463
00:43:32,104 --> 00:43:35,229
- I thought you weren't coming.
- I would have got you the money.

464
00:43:35,305 --> 00:43:37,067
The money?

465
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:42,328
Do you feel that?

466
00:43:42,406 --> 00:43:44,668
Do you feel anything?

467
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,530
You know, I counted.
I've seen you laugh three times.

468
00:43:50,608 --> 00:43:52,004
Four.

469
00:43:56,473 --> 00:43:59,497
You think I'm so innocent.

470
00:43:59,575 --> 00:44:00,836
In my village,

471
00:44:00,907 --> 00:44:04,033
they chew those leaves to forget
how hard their lives are.

472
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,664
I use it to keep awake.

473
00:44:05,741 --> 00:44:08,264
You know it makes you look...

474
00:44:09,975 --> 00:44:12,373
Senay.

475
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:15,204
You should keep away from me.

476
00:44:15,276 --> 00:44:17,367
You lost your job.

477
00:44:17,443 --> 00:44:19,932
Because of me,
you are in a sweatshop.

478
00:44:22,777 --> 00:44:25,175
And now you are going again.

479
00:44:25,277 --> 00:44:27,072
Be sure you make it to New York.

480
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:30,635
I will make it to New York,
Okwe, thank you.

481
00:44:35,145 --> 00:44:37,634
It's best if you don't show up
until after 5:00.

482
00:44:37,712 --> 00:44:40,769
Most porters are gone by then.
Only ghosts left.

483
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:41,936
Showers are here.

484
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:44,308
Water's not too hot,
but it runs.

485
00:44:44,379 --> 00:44:47,470
Couch in my office is pretty soft.

486
00:44:47,546 --> 00:44:50,569
Oh, I forgot.

487
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:53,238
You don't sleep, do you?

488
00:44:53,314 --> 00:44:57,872
My friend, welcome to my hotel.

489
00:44:57,948 --> 00:44:59,743
Beautiful, isn't it?

490
00:44:59,814 --> 00:45:03,769
And the other residents are, uh, very quiet.

491
00:45:03,847 --> 00:45:05,438
It will only be until I...

492
00:45:05,515 --> 00:45:07,981
Until the world improves.

493
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:55,184
Best truffles I've ever seen in England.

494
00:45:55,254 --> 00:45:58,084
Dug up 15 hours ago in Provence.

495
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:01,086
Came through on the night train.

496
00:46:07,788 --> 00:46:09,914
Shall we say one thousand?

497
00:46:09,989 --> 00:46:13,285
I'm in the wrong fucking hotel.

498
00:46:13,356 --> 00:46:15,685
One thousand, Señor Juan.
What do you say?

499
00:46:15,755 --> 00:46:19,119
Okay.
One thousand.

500
00:46:20,856 --> 00:46:24,482
But if I give you that price,
I need a favor.

501
00:46:24,557 --> 00:46:27,045
There is a night porter.
African.

502
00:46:27,123 --> 00:46:30,487
He came from you, so I guess
he came through Amsterdam.

503
00:46:30,557 --> 00:46:33,217
Yes.
What about him?

504
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:36,746
He's some kind of doctor.
What kind of doctor?

505
00:46:36,825 --> 00:46:39,723
I need to know what there is to know.

506
00:46:40,292 --> 00:46:42,723
Police! Police!

507
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:05,354
Can I help you gentlemen?

508
00:47:05,429 --> 00:47:08,054
We're looking for someone called Senay Gelik.

509
00:47:08,128 --> 00:47:10,060
Thought she might be working here.

510
00:47:10,128 --> 00:47:13,561
Do you see anybody working here?

511
00:47:13,629 --> 00:47:17,528
If you see her, give us a call.

512
00:47:41,298 --> 00:47:43,321
You have been here for two days.

513
00:47:43,398 --> 00:47:46,762
And already because of you,
I'm in trouble.

514
00:47:46,832 --> 00:47:49,992
Maybe I should call lmmigration.

515
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:52,726
Should I call them?

516
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,426
You wouldn't do that.

517
00:47:54,499 --> 00:47:58,660
I need a good reason.
What can you give me?

518
00:47:59,567 --> 00:48:03,432
If they find out you've been
working, what will they do?

519
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,126
They will put you in prison.

520
00:48:06,201 --> 00:48:10,032
And here,
they mix the men and women.

521
00:48:10,102 --> 00:48:14,034
So every night,
you will be raped.

522
00:48:18,169 --> 00:48:21,102
If you want to be like a Western girl,

523
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:24,534
that's what happens to Western girls.

524
00:48:24,637 --> 00:48:27,762
If you want to go to jail, fine.

525
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:30,327
If you can't give me a good reason,

526
00:48:30,403 --> 00:48:33,892
I will call the lmmigration.

527
00:48:33,971 --> 00:48:35,938
I'm a good man, Senay.

528
00:48:36,004 --> 00:48:38,664
I know where to draw the line.

529
00:48:39,738 --> 00:48:42,227
I don't want to take your virginity, Senay.

530
00:48:42,305 --> 00:48:46,431
I just want you to help me to relax.

531
00:48:56,306 --> 00:49:00,205
You have such a beautiful mouth, Senay.

532
00:49:07,408 --> 00:49:08,896
Achtung! Achtung!
(Attention!)

533
00:49:08,976 --> 00:49:11,373
My ladies and gentlemen,
your coach awaits.

534
00:49:11,442 --> 00:49:13,840
Please. Please.

535
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:17,172
But you must take your own
luggage to the coach.

536
00:49:17,242 --> 00:49:20,037
Please. Thank you. Good evening.

537
00:49:20,109 --> 00:49:24,599
I will help only those
who cannot carry their own bags.

538
00:49:24,676 --> 00:49:27,108
Okwe, get up here.

539
00:49:33,144 --> 00:49:35,575
- This man is a doctor.
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

540
00:49:35,644 --> 00:49:37,974
She's okay.
She only needs to rest a minute.

541
00:49:38,044 --> 00:49:40,533
He qualified in Lagos.

542
00:49:40,613 --> 00:49:43,374
He worked for the Nigerian government.

543
00:49:43,445 --> 00:49:47,378
His name is Dr. Olusegun Olatokumbo Fadipe.

544
00:49:47,446 --> 00:49:50,571
We must hurry or we'll miss the coach.

545
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,246
In the end,

546
00:50:00,313 --> 00:50:04,110
I find out everything
about everyone in this place.

547
00:50:05,715 --> 00:50:09,148
Here.
Take a look at this.

548
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:12,204
French.
It's a work of art.

549
00:50:12,282 --> 00:50:15,248
There are two Lebanese I use
who are the best in London.

550
00:50:15,315 --> 00:50:17,043
You give them a photograph...

551
00:50:17,115 --> 00:50:20,548
I have no idea what you're
talking about, Señor Juan.

552
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:24,946
If you were just some African,
the deal would be simple.

553
00:50:25,016 --> 00:50:28,380
You give me your kidney,
I give you a new identity.

554
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:31,383
I sell the kidney for 10 grand,
so I'm happy.

555
00:50:31,451 --> 00:50:35,247
The person who needs the kidney
gets cured, so he's happy.

556
00:50:35,317 --> 00:50:37,147
The person who sold his kidney

557
00:50:37,218 --> 00:50:40,616
gets to stay in this beautiful
country, so he's happy.

558
00:50:40,684 --> 00:50:44,549
My whole business is based on happiness.

559
00:50:44,619 --> 00:50:49,950
But for you,
Dr. Olusegun Olatokumbo Fadipe,

560
00:50:50,019 --> 00:50:53,042
I've a better idea.

561
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,109
I do not want to get involved,
Señor Juan.

562
00:50:56,187 --> 00:51:00,949
Each time you operate,
you get £3,000.

563
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:05,011
A passport for you and one for Senay.

564
00:51:05,088 --> 00:51:06,384
Take her on honeymoon.

565
00:51:06,455 --> 00:51:09,546
I do not want to get involved.

566
00:51:09,622 --> 00:51:12,554
You could even go back to Africa.

567
00:51:12,622 --> 00:51:15,987
And no one would know who the fuck you are.

568
00:51:17,723 --> 00:51:19,154
Your choice.

569
00:51:19,222 --> 00:51:21,211
No rush.

570
00:51:21,289 --> 00:51:27,484
Just wanted to put a little wasp in your head.

571
00:51:38,057 --> 00:51:39,921
Unusual.

572
00:51:39,992 --> 00:51:43,685
Chinese guy with no family.

573
00:51:43,758 --> 00:51:46,919
Maybe he's from the back of a truck.

574
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,787
I cut off his buttons so his spirit can escape.

575
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,791
I'm sewing up his pockets

576
00:51:54,859 --> 00:51:59,815
so he can't take his bad luck
with him to the spirit world.

577
00:51:59,894 --> 00:52:01,291
If he's an atheist,

578
00:52:01,361 --> 00:52:04,794
I'm ruining a suit no one will ever see.

579
00:52:04,861 --> 00:52:08,623
If he's a Buddhist,
I'm giving him eternal happiness

580
00:52:08,694 --> 00:52:10,557
for the price of a piece of thread.

581
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:13,618
I have found out why the heart was at the room.

582
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:16,183
They are removing kidneys.

583
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:19,387
One of their patients died at their hands.

584
00:52:19,463 --> 00:52:22,054
Another, I treated for
a staphylococcal infection.

585
00:52:22,129 --> 00:52:24,857
You're treating people?

586
00:52:24,963 --> 00:52:26,451
I hope you charge.

587
00:52:26,496 --> 00:52:28,655
Did you hear what I said?

588
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:33,425
There's nothing so dangerous as a virtuous man.

589
00:52:33,497 --> 00:52:35,486
Well, Okwe,
if you're so concerned,

590
00:52:35,564 --> 00:52:37,258
you should go to the police.

591
00:52:37,331 --> 00:52:38,728
Get yourself deported.

592
00:52:38,797 --> 00:52:42,127
Do you think if it were for
deportation I would not do it?

593
00:52:42,198 --> 00:52:44,721
I'm a wanted man, Guo Yi!

594
00:52:46,332 --> 00:52:48,389
Wanted for what?

595
00:52:52,265 --> 00:52:56,664
Okwe, you didn't know people sold their organs?

596
00:52:57,733 --> 00:53:00,222
- Not here.
- What do you mean, 'here'?

597
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,199
Here in London you think it doesn't happen

598
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:05,256
because the queen doesn't approve?

599
00:53:05,334 --> 00:53:08,266
I heard in London it's 10 grand for a kidney.

600
00:53:08,334 --> 00:53:11,391
For that, people take risks.

601
00:53:11,468 --> 00:53:15,231
If I had the courage,
I'd sell my kidney.

602
00:53:15,302 --> 00:53:18,063
Just to get out of here.

603
00:53:18,636 --> 00:53:22,034
Just to save my brain.

604
00:54:14,341 --> 00:54:16,274
The problem with being on time

605
00:54:16,341 --> 00:54:19,365
is that you can always be tracked down.

606
00:54:19,443 --> 00:54:21,738
What do you think of the girl?

607
00:54:21,809 --> 00:54:25,004
She's my next customer.
8 years old.

608
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:26,803
She's called Rima.

609
00:54:26,843 --> 00:54:31,139
Her family brought her over
from Saudi hoping for a miracle.

610
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:35,575
If she doesn't get the new
kidney, she's going to die.

611
00:54:36,777 --> 00:54:38,710
The doctor we use is no good.

612
00:54:38,777 --> 00:54:40,107
If he fucks up again,

613
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:43,405
there'll be another heart down the lavatory.

614
00:54:46,612 --> 00:54:50,044
Okwe?
You still there?

615
00:54:51,345 --> 00:54:53,868
So I'm an evil man, right?

616
00:54:53,946 --> 00:54:56,844
But I'm trying to save her life.

617
00:54:56,912 --> 00:54:58,879
That's weird, huh?

618
00:54:58,947 --> 00:55:02,311
Kind of thing that keeps you awake at night.

619
00:55:12,547 --> 00:55:16,605
Tonight, London is colder than Moscow.

620
00:55:16,682 --> 00:55:19,614
I heard it on the radio.

621
00:55:44,952 --> 00:55:46,349
Okwe?

622
00:55:47,318 --> 00:55:51,719
It is a crazy idea,
but we really can do it.

623
00:55:51,785 --> 00:55:53,911
You said you liked New York.

624
00:55:53,987 --> 00:55:59,214
But if not New York, then maybe
Boston or Los Angeles.

625
00:55:59,286 --> 00:56:02,684
I'm going there, Okwe.
What do you think?

626
00:56:02,754 --> 00:56:05,686
And, Okwe,
you could go there, too.

627
00:56:06,787 --> 00:56:10,652
Senay, are you okay?

628
00:56:10,721 --> 00:56:12,653
Senay, where are you?

629
00:56:12,721 --> 00:56:14,880
What has happened?

630
00:56:57,826 --> 00:57:00,348
I knocked,
but you did not hear me.

631
00:57:01,926 --> 00:57:03,949
Senay, are you okay?

632
00:57:04,727 --> 00:57:07,352
Senay, what has happened?

633
00:57:07,427 --> 00:57:09,916
The factory does not suit me.

634
00:57:09,994 --> 00:57:13,983
My hands are too soft.
I cut my fingers.

635
00:57:14,061 --> 00:57:18,653
So I have decided to go to America.

636
00:57:20,628 --> 00:57:22,686
For America,
you would need a visa.

637
00:57:25,829 --> 00:57:28,454
Or maybe a European passport.

638
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,996
- You keep away from Señor Juan!
- It is like taking out a tooth.

639
00:57:33,063 --> 00:57:34,859
He's lying, Senay!

640
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:37,760
Because you are poor, you will
be gutted like an animal.

641
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:40,296
They will cut you here,
or they will cut you here.

642
00:57:40,364 --> 00:57:42,296
They will take what they want.

643
00:57:42,364 --> 00:57:45,524
One of the laundry girls did it.
And now she's free.

644
00:57:45,598 --> 00:57:47,258
Others are dead, Senay!

645
00:57:47,332 --> 00:57:49,298
So they are free, too.

646
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,263
What would your God say?

647
00:57:52,932 --> 00:57:55,160
My God does not speak to me anymore.

648
00:57:55,233 --> 00:57:57,222
Don't break, Senay.

649
00:57:57,299 --> 00:57:58,730
Save money.

650
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:01,493
Keep New York in your head and work hard.

651
00:58:03,466 --> 00:58:06,762
You know what kind of work I do?

652
00:58:17,801 --> 00:58:19,700
Lunch!

653
00:59:29,243 --> 00:59:33,006
Okwe, somebody's in
the back room looking for you.

654
00:59:33,076 --> 00:59:36,009
She look like a film star, boy.

655
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:43,435
Senay!

656
00:59:43,511 --> 00:59:47,841
Look, Okwe, I know for sure
that this coat costs £300.

657
00:59:47,911 --> 00:59:49,968
- And this dress...
- Tell me what has happened.

658
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:52,534
We can sell the coat for £200.

659
00:59:52,612 --> 00:59:55,204
Senay, where did you get these?

660
00:59:55,279 --> 00:59:56,869
I bit, Okwe.

661
00:59:57,646 --> 00:59:59,908
At the factory.

662
00:59:59,979 --> 01:00:02,605
He said he would report me to lmmigration.

663
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,044
And he made me suck.

664
01:00:05,113 --> 01:00:07,773
But today, I bit.

665
01:00:07,846 --> 01:00:09,473
I bit.

666
01:00:10,947 --> 01:00:12,970
I bit.

667
01:00:37,116 --> 01:00:40,674
Señor Juan sometimes has rooms in the hotel.

668
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:41,773
No, Senay.

669
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:44,840
- Just for tonight.
- No.

670
01:00:44,917 --> 01:00:47,179
Through there is hot water and a shower.

671
01:00:47,251 --> 01:00:49,218
Hurry, Senay.

672
01:00:52,218 --> 01:00:55,184
What is this place, Okwe?

673
01:00:55,786 --> 01:00:58,946
It is a place where you can stay for tonight.

674
01:00:59,019 --> 01:01:00,712
So cold.

675
01:01:00,786 --> 01:01:04,719
If anyone comes,
you are a friend of Guo Yi.

676
01:01:26,056 --> 01:01:29,022
Tomorrow we will find you somewhere to live.

677
01:01:39,524 --> 01:01:43,388
So... it is in there.

678
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:51,016
I can hear it.

679
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:54,451
Your heart.

680
01:03:03,866 --> 01:03:05,695
Hello.
Room service.

681
01:03:19,034 --> 01:03:22,228
Buenos dias, negro.

682
01:03:31,436 --> 01:03:33,925
Come on.
Come on!

683
01:03:40,804 --> 01:03:43,168
She is nil by mouth the whole day.

684
01:03:43,237 --> 01:03:44,896
Please.

685
01:03:49,938 --> 01:03:51,234
Sister.

686
01:03:51,304 --> 01:03:53,498
Help me, brother.

687
01:03:57,972 --> 01:04:01,200
Stop acting like you've got a choice.

688
01:04:05,939 --> 01:04:07,337
Please!

689
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,497
Put on your clothes.

690
01:04:09,573 --> 01:04:11,732
Son of a bitch!

691
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:14,569
You came in a truck,
but you're going home in chains!

692
01:04:14,641 --> 01:04:17,334
- They'll deliver you like meat!
- No!

693
01:04:20,008 --> 01:04:23,566
The whole world is wrong except you, Okwe?

694
01:04:23,675 --> 01:04:26,402
What?
What, Okwe?

695
01:04:26,442 --> 01:04:31,398
You are going to cut me up and flush me away?

696
01:04:31,476 --> 01:04:32,703
Huh?

697
01:05:07,046 --> 01:05:09,478
I really don't know you at all,
do I, Okwe?

698
01:05:09,547 --> 01:05:12,013
- This is Senay. She is a friend.
- I'm not your friend.

699
01:05:12,081 --> 01:05:14,911
- She's been out here all night.
- I would rather freeze to death

700
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,446
than go into that building again.

701
01:05:16,514 --> 01:05:18,537
You know, there are mornings I feel the same.

702
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:19,705
Come.
It's cold.

703
01:05:19,781 --> 01:05:21,906
This is the house of the dead, Okwe!

704
01:05:21,981 --> 01:05:23,970
They're all dead!

705
01:05:25,183 --> 01:05:27,045
Okwe.

706
01:05:28,682 --> 01:05:30,671
Maybe this will help.

707
01:05:30,749 --> 01:05:34,147
My cousin has a room in Chinatown.

708
01:05:34,216 --> 01:05:36,580
I guess there's space for two.

709
01:05:38,583 --> 01:05:43,175
You know, Okwe, good at chess
usually means bad at life.

710
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:46,512
You do realize that she's
in love with you, don't you?

711
01:05:46,584 --> 01:05:50,312
I've been with her 20 minutes,
and I know it.

712
01:05:50,384 --> 01:05:53,817
But then, I'm bad at chess.

713
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:04,615
Senay, there is something I must tell you.

714
01:06:04,686 --> 01:06:07,379
- This is your religion?
- I have no religion.

715
01:06:07,454 --> 01:06:09,113
Senay.

716
01:06:10,586 --> 01:06:13,144
You have stopped chewing the leaf.

717
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:15,243
I can see it in your eyes.

718
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:18,412
You know, Okwe,
your eyes are quite pretty.

719
01:06:18,487 --> 01:06:22,215
- They're not bad-looking.
- Senay, listen to me.

720
01:06:24,254 --> 01:06:27,050
I come to this churchyard often.

721
01:06:27,122 --> 01:06:31,350
I come here to be alone
and to think about my wife.

722
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:35,747
So now you see.

723
01:06:35,823 --> 01:06:38,016
What do I see?

724
01:06:38,091 --> 01:06:40,283
You should not see me anymore.

725
01:06:44,423 --> 01:06:46,390
Do you love her?

726
01:06:46,458 --> 01:06:47,424
Do you love her?

727
01:06:47,491 --> 01:06:49,117
There is a room above a restaurant.

728
01:06:49,191 --> 01:06:51,157
Immigration police do not go into Chinatown.

729
01:06:51,224 --> 01:06:52,850
- You will be safe.
- Do you love her?

730
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:54,618
Here's money for the rent I owe you.

731
01:06:54,691 --> 01:06:57,522
There is more for the trouble
I have caused you.

732
01:06:57,592 --> 01:06:59,683
- Do you love her?
- Love?

733
01:07:02,492 --> 01:07:06,016
For you and I,
there is only survival.

734
01:07:07,159 --> 01:07:10,614
It is time you woke up from your stupid dream.

735
01:07:38,629 --> 01:07:39,856
Yes?

736
01:07:41,863 --> 01:07:43,659
Senay.

737
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:48,022
Are you going on holiday or something?

738
01:07:49,931 --> 01:07:52,056
Señor Juan.

739
01:08:01,432 --> 01:08:02,693
Señor Juan.

740
01:08:02,766 --> 01:08:04,459
America, maybe?

741
01:08:22,301 --> 01:08:23,232
Come on.

742
01:08:23,334 --> 01:08:25,562
You cleaned up their shit so long.

743
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:28,090
Now you can be one of them.

744
01:09:27,374 --> 01:09:29,533
Who is it?

745
01:09:29,608 --> 01:09:33,632
It's me.
I got some paperwork.

746
01:09:35,209 --> 01:09:37,334
Okay.
How old are you?

747
01:09:37,409 --> 01:09:38,807
22.

748
01:09:38,876 --> 01:09:40,842
How old do you want to be?

749
01:09:40,909 --> 01:09:42,603
22.

750
01:09:43,877 --> 01:09:46,342
Hey, Come on.
Relax.

751
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:48,206
I can make you whatever you want.

752
01:09:48,277 --> 01:09:50,708
You want to be Spanish?
Or Greek?

753
01:09:50,777 --> 01:09:52,266
Italian.

754
01:09:52,878 --> 01:09:54,605
You're going to need a new name.

755
01:09:54,678 --> 01:09:57,201
Isabella Encarico.

756
01:09:57,279 --> 01:09:58,743
You're sure that's Italian?

757
01:09:58,811 --> 01:10:01,505
She owns a café in New York.

758
01:10:27,748 --> 01:10:30,738
Okay.
You are at New York lmmigration.

759
01:10:30,815 --> 01:10:31,941
What's your name?

760
01:10:32,015 --> 01:10:33,981
Isabella Fontana Encarico.

761
01:10:34,049 --> 01:10:36,072
- How old are you?
- 22.

762
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:38,081
- Where were you born?
- Napoli.

763
01:10:38,149 --> 01:10:40,274
- Where in Napoli?
- Arenella.

764
01:10:40,349 --> 01:10:43,248
Right.

765
01:10:43,317 --> 01:10:47,147
The trick, Senay, is to believe
you are the new person.

766
01:10:47,217 --> 01:10:50,980
If you believe it inside, then
the lmmigration will believe it.

767
01:10:51,051 --> 01:10:53,108
Drink, Senay?

768
01:10:57,318 --> 01:11:01,081
What are you afraid of?
Okwe's gone.

769
01:11:01,152 --> 01:11:03,618
Got scared and go away.

770
01:11:05,619 --> 01:11:07,448
Go to hell.

771
01:11:09,586 --> 01:11:12,485
This is hell.

772
01:11:12,554 --> 01:11:15,246
I'm helping you to get away.

773
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,411
Take off your robe.

774
01:11:16,487 --> 01:11:18,044
Come on.
Come on.

775
01:11:18,121 --> 01:11:19,643
Hey, hey!
Stop! Stop that!

776
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:21,948
Stop that!

777
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:24,316
I can't believe it!

778
01:11:24,421 --> 01:11:26,910
I'm arguing like you are my fucking wife!

779
01:11:26,955 --> 01:11:29,080
Let me explain something, Senay.

780
01:11:29,155 --> 01:11:33,747
Your robe, now, is what the
Americans call a 'deal breaker.'

781
01:11:33,822 --> 01:11:35,482
So...

782
01:11:35,556 --> 01:11:37,044
No.

783
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:42,886
You are this close to New York,
and you said no.

784
01:12:00,859 --> 01:12:02,415
Wait.

785
01:12:07,193 --> 01:12:10,647
I want the whole thing.
That's the deal.

786
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:12,817
Take it or leave it.

787
01:12:14,493 --> 01:12:17,324
You do not see me.

788
01:12:17,393 --> 01:12:19,951
You just do.

789
01:12:20,027 --> 01:12:21,890
Take it or leave it.

790
01:12:56,865 --> 01:12:59,490
So it wasn't so bad, huh?

791
01:12:59,564 --> 01:13:01,326
Nothing to cry about.

792
01:13:01,398 --> 01:13:03,728
I'm not crying.

793
01:13:03,799 --> 01:13:07,424
If you told me it was the first
time, I'd have cut a ribbon.

794
01:13:11,032 --> 01:13:14,760
I can't believe Okwe never fucked you.

795
01:13:14,833 --> 01:13:17,231
You kind of love him, huh?

796
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:21,232
Women love men most who don't love them back.

797
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:25,029
Well, you had a lucky escape.

798
01:13:25,135 --> 01:13:27,761
You know why he ran away?

799
01:13:31,368 --> 01:13:33,800
Because I found out that in Africa,

800
01:13:33,869 --> 01:13:36,062
he murdered his own wife.

801
01:13:43,870 --> 01:13:47,201
You don't eat or drink for 24 hours, okay?

802
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:48,929
Doctor's orders.

803
01:14:16,106 --> 01:14:18,299
Senay is here?

804
01:14:20,141 --> 01:14:22,232
Senay is here?

805
01:14:39,109 --> 01:14:40,768
Senay.

806
01:14:50,643 --> 01:14:52,802
I will need a pill.

807
01:14:56,078 --> 01:14:59,841
There is a pill you can take the morning after.

808
01:15:01,844 --> 01:15:03,743
You're a doctor.

809
01:15:04,779 --> 01:15:07,802
At least you can get me a pill.

810
01:15:47,116 --> 01:15:49,878
I won't allow you to butcher her.

811
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:51,882
You won't allow?

812
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:54,711
I will operate on her myself.

813
01:15:54,784 --> 01:15:56,115
You'll do what?

814
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:57,912
I will do it.

815
01:15:57,984 --> 01:16:00,951
It is the only way I can be sure
she will not die.

816
01:16:02,851 --> 01:16:05,374
In return, I want a passport.

817
01:16:05,452 --> 01:16:07,509
A new identity.

818
01:16:08,519 --> 01:16:11,417
Well, holy shit.

819
01:16:11,485 --> 01:16:13,452
So you are human, Okwe?

820
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,577
I will bring you our photographs
tomorrow morning.

821
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:28,076
Hi. I'm Juliette.
I'm a friend of Okwe's.

822
01:16:28,155 --> 01:16:30,950
He said that you needed these.

823
01:16:35,321 --> 01:16:39,811
So, he did not care enough
to bring them himself.

824
01:16:39,889 --> 01:16:42,822
Oh, Okwe's an angel.

825
01:16:53,123 --> 01:16:56,215
There.
Never happened.

826
01:17:01,792 --> 01:17:05,190
So, what did happen?

827
01:17:11,025 --> 01:17:15,220
Before, I was a virgin.

828
01:17:15,293 --> 01:17:17,225
Jesus.

829
01:17:17,293 --> 01:17:18,918
Mohammed.

830
01:17:29,995 --> 01:17:32,154
What a pair.

831
01:17:32,228 --> 01:17:34,853
The virgin and the whore.

832
01:17:42,896 --> 01:17:46,090
- Boss?
- The doctor needs a good car.

833
01:17:48,496 --> 01:17:51,360
Take it.
Last time, you were lucky.

834
01:17:53,097 --> 01:17:54,960
Black is black.

835
01:18:16,132 --> 01:18:18,997
Wash these again.
Please.

836
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,228
Boil, boil, eh?
Hot, hot.

837
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:55,927
Oh, dear.

838
01:18:58,171 --> 01:19:01,729
So this is how you do it right.

839
01:19:01,805 --> 01:19:04,737
There can be no guarantee against E. Coli.

840
01:19:06,971 --> 01:19:08,869
Wonderful.

841
01:19:08,938 --> 01:19:10,131
Oh, yes.

842
01:19:10,205 --> 01:19:12,262
No, no.

843
01:19:23,374 --> 01:19:27,272
Passports.
It's something I do right.

844
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:41,532
No parking.

845
01:19:41,608 --> 01:19:43,972
Okwe wants me to wait here.

846
01:19:46,176 --> 01:19:49,041
I gave her a sedative an hour ago.

847
01:19:49,111 --> 01:19:51,508
She's only in a deep sleep.

848
01:19:51,576 --> 01:19:55,942
But now you are here, I can
administer the anesthetic.

849
01:19:56,011 --> 01:19:57,408
Now I'm here?

850
01:19:57,477 --> 01:20:00,308
You are going to be my assistant, Señor Juan.

851
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:01,843
What the fuck is this?

852
01:20:01,911 --> 01:20:04,742
I have noticed that if you
do not drink, your hands shake.

853
01:20:04,812 --> 01:20:06,209
When you pass me the scalpel,

854
01:20:06,278 --> 01:20:09,473
I do not want you to cut off my fingers.

855
01:20:13,279 --> 01:20:15,745
Where will they come to collect?

856
01:20:18,213 --> 01:20:20,872
If you faint,
I will have only half an hour

857
01:20:20,946 --> 01:20:23,071
before the kidney begins to deteriorate.

858
01:20:23,146 --> 01:20:27,307
They come to the laundry bay.
Back of the kitchen.

859
01:20:28,382 --> 01:20:30,074
You better start.

860
01:20:30,147 --> 01:20:32,045
Go and scrub your hands.

861
01:20:32,114 --> 01:20:36,774
Yes. Professional.

862
01:20:39,048 --> 01:20:40,537
It's decided.

863
01:20:40,615 --> 01:20:42,979
It's fucking decided.

864
01:20:43,049 --> 01:20:46,981
You and me are going into business.

865
01:20:48,882 --> 01:20:51,474
You know washing dishes?

866
01:20:51,550 --> 01:20:56,848
You know when you forget
on Friday and come in Monday,

867
01:20:56,917 --> 01:20:59,816
and there is a pan with sauce?

868
01:20:59,884 --> 01:21:01,281
White. Green.

869
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:02,338
Shit.

870
01:21:02,417 --> 01:21:05,145
That is...

871
01:21:05,218 --> 01:21:08,275
How they do things in the city.

872
01:21:11,852 --> 01:21:13,647
Jesus.

873
01:21:13,718 --> 01:21:16,446
Was I speaking English then?

874
01:21:16,519 --> 01:21:18,712
What you say?

875
01:21:18,786 --> 01:21:22,616
Why do you say?

876
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:24,242
Senay.

877
01:21:37,321 --> 01:21:39,617
I don't understand it,
how the ice will help.

878
01:21:39,688 --> 01:21:41,154
Make you last longer, babe.

879
01:21:41,222 --> 01:21:44,245
I don't want to last longer.
It's not even payday.

880
01:21:44,322 --> 01:21:46,880
All right.
Make you harder.

881
01:21:48,223 --> 01:21:51,451
Think what happens to water
when it freezes, huh?

882
01:21:53,223 --> 01:21:54,985
There.

883
01:21:55,057 --> 01:21:56,818
Get a bucket.

884
01:21:56,890 --> 01:21:58,356
Bucket?

885
01:21:59,324 --> 01:22:01,415
Come on!

886
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:06,083
Okwe, you have removed kidneys before?

887
01:22:06,158 --> 01:22:07,714
Many times.

888
01:22:07,791 --> 01:22:09,587
In pathology.

889
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:11,750
What is pathology?

890
01:22:11,826 --> 01:22:14,587
It means the patient is already dead.

891
01:22:15,792 --> 01:22:18,384
Did he tell you things about me, Senay?

892
01:22:20,426 --> 01:22:22,324
No.

893
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:32,982
Let me wipe your brow, Doctor.

894
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:51,688
Juliette, put the ice
on the bed and put on the gown.

895
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:00,692
Take the bag.

896
01:23:00,764 --> 01:23:02,196
Squeeze.

897
01:23:02,264 --> 01:23:03,627
Gently.

898
01:23:04,431 --> 01:23:06,294
We must go and scrub up.

899
01:23:13,399 --> 01:23:15,262
Cold tonight, huh?

900
01:23:18,133 --> 01:23:23,122
On the night like this,
who would want so much ice?

901
01:23:25,767 --> 01:23:28,597
You are Pylades.

902
01:23:28,667 --> 01:23:30,530
Pylades was the boatman

903
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:34,363
who ferried the souls to the land of the dead.

904
01:23:34,434 --> 01:23:35,764
If you didn't put a coin

905
01:23:35,835 --> 01:23:38,028
under the tongue of your dead relative,

906
01:23:38,101 --> 01:23:40,828
Pylades wouldn't take them to Hades

907
01:23:40,901 --> 01:23:44,197
no matter how good you had been in your life.

908
01:24:00,437 --> 01:24:01,425
Knife.

909
01:24:10,572 --> 01:24:12,061
Oh, Jesus.

910
01:24:12,138 --> 01:24:14,401
Juliette, you are not allowed to faint.

911
01:24:59,385 --> 01:25:00,408
Is that it, then?

912
01:25:00,485 --> 01:25:02,145
No, no.
I must sew him up.

913
01:25:02,219 --> 01:25:03,708
Why?

914
01:25:05,953 --> 01:25:07,943
Fetch me stitches.

915
01:25:16,954 --> 01:25:20,148
Juliette, will you go and check
there is no one else waiting?

916
01:25:20,221 --> 01:25:21,312
Yeah.

917
01:25:38,056 --> 01:25:40,420
Where's Señor Juan?

918
01:25:40,523 --> 01:25:42,284
He's drunk.

919
01:26:07,393 --> 01:26:11,087
How come I've never seen you people before?

920
01:26:11,159 --> 01:26:14,489
Because we are the people you do not see.

921
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:17,254
We are the ones who drive your cabs.

922
01:26:17,327 --> 01:26:19,350
We clean your rooms.

923
01:26:19,427 --> 01:26:21,552
And suck your cocks.

924
01:26:38,496 --> 01:26:40,359
In one hour, call an ambulance.

925
01:26:40,463 --> 01:26:42,554
Send them up to Room 510.

926
01:26:42,596 --> 01:26:44,062
Juliette.

927
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:46,518
Thank you.

928
01:26:46,597 --> 01:26:48,392
Shh.
It's okay.

929
01:26:48,464 --> 01:26:50,486
- One hour.
- Okay.

930
01:27:01,665 --> 01:27:04,929
Handa?
Handa, it's me... Senay.

931
01:27:04,999 --> 01:27:06,965
You hear how good my English is?

932
01:27:07,033 --> 01:27:08,521
I'm coming to New York.

933
01:27:08,599 --> 01:27:11,532
I'm coming to New York!
I'm coming to New York!

934
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,998
- My hands are shaking.
- So are mine.

935
01:27:14,066 --> 01:27:15,692
I don't have a driver's license.

936
01:27:15,767 --> 01:27:17,699
Hey. It's dead.

937
01:27:17,767 --> 01:27:19,233
It's the tunnel.

938
01:27:19,301 --> 01:27:21,529
I must tell her what time we land.

939
01:27:21,601 --> 01:27:23,692
Senay, what Sneaky told you was true.

940
01:27:23,768 --> 01:27:25,290
He did not tell me anything.

941
01:27:25,367 --> 01:27:28,493
I did not kill my wife myself,
but still it was my fault.

942
01:27:28,569 --> 01:27:31,468
- I was a pathologist in Lagos.
- Now we are someone new.

943
01:27:31,535 --> 01:27:33,330
A government official was shot.

944
01:27:33,402 --> 01:27:35,527
I was told to destroy the evidence.

945
01:27:35,602 --> 01:27:38,398
When I refused,
my house was firebombed.

946
01:27:38,470 --> 01:27:40,435
My wife was still inside.

947
01:27:41,436 --> 01:27:44,267
The police charged me with her murder.

948
01:27:46,937 --> 01:27:49,335
I had to run.

949
01:27:49,404 --> 01:27:51,597
But my daughter stayed.

950
01:27:51,671 --> 01:27:56,036
Valerie.
She's with my sister in Lagos.

951
01:27:56,538 --> 01:27:58,834
How old is she?

952
01:27:59,405 --> 01:28:01,633
7.

953
01:28:02,438 --> 01:28:04,405
I must go to her.

954
01:28:50,777 --> 01:28:52,937
Tell me about Lagos.

955
01:28:53,011 --> 01:28:56,136
Do they have hotels that need maids?

956
01:28:57,811 --> 01:28:59,334
When you arrive at the airport,

957
01:28:59,412 --> 01:29:03,310
you will see a whole line of yellow cabs.

958
01:29:03,379 --> 01:29:05,742
The car will take you across a bridge.

959
01:29:06,612 --> 01:29:09,443
When you have crossed the river,
you will see

960
01:29:09,513 --> 01:29:11,673
lights in the trees.

961
01:29:12,513 --> 01:29:14,844
Policemen on white horses.

962
01:29:14,913 --> 01:29:16,435
No.

963
01:29:19,147 --> 01:29:22,137
I know that it won't be like that.

964
01:29:26,015 --> 01:29:27,946
Goodbye, Okwe.

965
01:29:43,916 --> 01:29:46,144
Senay.

966
01:29:48,517 --> 01:29:50,483
Hold me.

967
01:29:53,384 --> 01:29:56,680
You must go.
Isabella.

968
01:29:56,751 --> 01:29:59,376
Always we must hide.

969
01:30:05,552 --> 01:30:08,643
This is the café where my cousin works.

970
01:31:16,594 --> 01:31:19,082
I love you.

971
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:17,191
Hello?

972
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:22,993
Valerie.

973
01:32:26,367 --> 01:32:28,231
Yes, it's me.

974
01:32:31,168 --> 01:32:32,828
At last.

975
01:32:35,602 --> 01:32:37,933
I'm coming home.

976
01:33:41,908 --> 01:33:47,273
' Now I'm wakin' at the crack of dawn '

977
01:33:47,342 --> 01:33:52,798
' To send a little money home from here, too '

978
01:33:52,875 --> 01:33:58,399
' The moon is risin' like a discotheque '

979
01:33:58,477 --> 01:34:03,966
' And now my bags are down
and packed for travelin' '

980
01:34:04,043 --> 01:34:08,137
' Lookin' at happiness,
keepin' my flavor fresh '

981
01:34:08,211 --> 01:34:14,303
' Nobody knows, I guess,
how far I'll go, I know '

982
01:34:14,378 --> 01:34:19,039
' So I'm leavin' at 6 o'clock,
meet in a parking lot '

983
01:34:19,113 --> 01:34:23,977
' Have in your hand a shot,
sunglasses on '

984
01:34:24,046 --> 01:34:32,707
' She waits by this glass
and concrete and stone '

985
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:40,839
' It is just a house,
not a home '

986
01:34:40,915 --> 01:34:46,314
' Skin that covers me from head to toe '

987
01:34:46,383 --> 01:34:51,974
' Except a couple tiny holes and openings '

988
01:34:52,049 --> 01:34:57,312
' Where the city's blowin' in and out '

989
01:34:57,384 --> 01:35:02,975
' And this is what
it's all about, delightfully '

990
01:35:03,050 --> 01:35:06,847
' Everything's possible when you're an animal '

991
01:35:06,917 --> 01:35:13,181
' Not inconceivable
how things can change, I know '

992
01:35:13,251 --> 01:35:16,115
' So I'm puttin' on after-shave '

993
01:35:16,185 --> 01:35:18,015
' Nothing is out of place '

994
01:35:18,085 --> 01:35:20,075
' Gonna be on my way '

995
01:35:20,152 --> 01:35:22,640
' Try to pretend '

996
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:31,881
' It's not only glass and concrete and stone '

997
01:35:31,953 --> 01:35:39,910
' And it's just a house,
not a home '

998
01:35:53,623 --> 01:36:01,148
' And it's glass and concrete and stone '

999
01:36:01,223 --> 01:36:08,385
' It is just a house,
not a home '

1000
01:36:08,458 --> 01:36:15,823
' And my head is 50 feet high '

1001
01:36:15,891 --> 01:36:24,518
' Let my body and soul be my guide '
