00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,531
- She might do that. Sure.
- Will you get off!

175
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,703
- Was that you?
- Get off the phone!

176
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,286
- I'm so sorry!
- No, no, no. Not you, Victoria.

177
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,088
I didn't know you were on the phone.

179
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,797
What do you mean, do I love you?

180
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,720
Well, I...

181
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,434
Well, we met and...

182
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,055
You moved in, didn't you?

183
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,603
Well, it's just a very complicated thing.

184
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,238
Hey, do you love me?

185
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,733
Well, there you go.

186
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,831
There she went.

00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,085
Cindy, hi.

190
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,931
- How are you?
- How are you?

191
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,801
Excuse me.

192
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,469
You look so pretty!

193
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,859
Darn! My flash never works!

194
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,984
Figures.
My mother-in-law gave it to me.

195
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,278
ALLEN: Get up!

196
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,777
What? What?

197
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,371
It was embarrassing
when you were 10, Freddie.

198
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,074
Look, if something works for me,
I stick with it!

199
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,917
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

200
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,537
I got to get more involved with business,
and I intend to.

201
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:58,215
I mean that this time. I'm going to.
I know the business.

202
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,258
I was there at the beginning with Dad,
remember?

203
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,218
I just wanna know if we sell
fruit and vegetables, or is it just fruit?

204
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,305
By the time I came home,
she was already gone.

205
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,806
- Victoria left, huh?
- Yeah.

206
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,514
You know why she left me, Freddie?

207
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,812
Because I didn't love her.

208
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,234
That bitch.

- Anywhere but the first three rows.
- Hey!

211
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,204
Hi, Freddie.
Hey, Allen, where's Victoria?

212
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,161
She's sick, and she can't make it.

213
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,079
That's too bad. I'm sorry.

214
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,418
Why I didn't love her, Freddie?
Can you answer me that?

215
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,625
Why I didn't love her?
I mean, she had everything.

216
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:44,632
She was bright, she was sensitive,
she was beautiful.

217
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,055
- Hey, Allen!
- Hi.

218
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,222
Where's Victoria?

219
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,471
Flu. Bad flu. She's very sick.

220
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,302
And she can't make it
because of the flu.

221
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,680
- Give her my love.
- You bet! Sure.

222
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,059
I can't even give her my love, Freddie.

223
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:01,900
I'm telling you.
Something in here is not working.

224
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,232
There are worse organs
not to be working. Ha!

225
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,906
Hi, guys. Bauer,
where's that pretty lady of yours?

226
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,612
She's not coming! Okay?

227
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,413
What? Do you want your money back?

228
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,579
Well, I don't know.
Maybe it's all for the best.

229
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,291
- Hey, Allen.
- She left me!

230
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,624
She moved out.
My life's a shambles, okay?

231
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,254
That's the news. You want the weather?

232
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,256
Anywhere but the first three rows!

233
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,053
You should really lighten up on the guy.
That's the bride's brother.

234
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,309
You see, drinking is really a matter
of algebraic ratios.

235
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,812
How drunk you get depends on
how much alcohol you consume

236
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,814
in relation to your total body weight.

237
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,738
You see my point?
It's not that you had a lot to drink,

238
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:45,982
it's just that you're too skinny.

239
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,236
- Marceau, more drinks here, please.
- No.

240
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,617
Freddie, I don't want to get drunk.

241
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,331
But you are drunk.

242
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,750
You see, a sober person
would have reached for the pretzels.

243
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,870
- Is he going to be there long?
- I don't know.

244
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,581
- Oh, I'm on the bar.
- You're on the bar.

245
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,716
Come on, off the bar.

246
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,920
This stool is in your way.
Let me move that for you.

247
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,513
Oh, oh, you fell.

248
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,885
That hurt.
You're not having a good day, are you?

00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,062
Wasn't that a beautiful
wedding ceremony?

That was a beautiful ceremony.

00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,267
It was. It really was.

- Fine.

256
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,699
Where did you get those?

257
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,702
My grandmother. She left them to me.

258
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,159
She did? They're beautiful.

259
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,618
Thank you.

00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,038

00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:43,622
- Hi.
- Hi.

262
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,799
You guys are in love, aren't you?

263
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:47,710
We just met.

264
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,888
That doesn't matter.
I know about these things.

265
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,973
I can see. I can tell.

266
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:58,854
You two guys, you're in love.
And I think that's beautiful.

267
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,148
Thanks.

268
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,733
Listen. I don't live too far from here.

269
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,907
Why don't we just go to my place
for a quiet drink?

270
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,819
Do I expect too much out of life?

271
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,031
My dress! I can't believe this.

272
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,708
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, what are you doing?

273
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,245
Both of you. You're both crazy!

274
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,838
I'm sorry. Look...

275
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,666
I don't ask that much, do I?

276
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,927
I don't ask to be famous,
I don't ask to be rich,

277
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:33,722
I don't ask to play center field
for the New York Yankees or anything.

278
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,058
I just want to meet a woman.
I wanna meet a woman.

279
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,928
And I wanna fall in love,
and I wanna get married.

280
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,011
And I want to have a kid,

281
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,019
and I want to go see him play a tooth
in the school play.

282
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,272
It's not much.

283
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,188
But I'm kidding myself.

284
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,693
It's never going to happen.

285
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,318
I'm going to grow old,

286
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,037
and grow lonely, and I'm gonna die,

287
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,369
and I'll be surrounded
by a bunch of rotten fruit.

288
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,211
- Freddie?
- No kidding!

289
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,165
Freddie?

290
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,632
Allen! I want you to meet
some friends of mine.

00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,634
This is Tawny, and this is Jill.

00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,182
- I'm Tawny.
- You're Tawny, Tawny Tiger!

293
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,142
And this is Jill, a four-letter word.

294
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,311
- This is my brother, Allen.
- Hi.

295
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,306
- Freddie, can I talk to you?
- Absolutely.

296
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,016
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

297
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,268
I'll be right back.
We'll whisper some more.

Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

a time-sharing condominium.

with them.

No, Freddie, I'm going to Cape Cod.

304
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,002
What are you talking about?
Cape Cod?

305
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,704
Why would you go to Cape Cod?

306
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,415
I don't know.
Because I like Cape Cod, Freddie.

307
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:51,800
I feel better up there.

308
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:55,012
I look at the water
and I feel closer to something.

309
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,681
- Cape Cod over Rio? Are you all right?
- Yeah.

310
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,602
- Let me drive you up there.
- No, no.

311
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,895
- You got enough money?
- I've got plenty.

312
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,938
- Yeah?
- Thanks.

313
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,608

Well, I'm sorry. I usually enjoy
smashing the glass with my face.

319
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,753
Okay. Cape Cod. That's about
300 miles. You got the cash?

320
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,762

Be careful with that!

00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:07,247
What do you think you're loading?
This is delicate scientific equipment.

325
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:14,424
Hold it. Put it down. You see that?
It says, "This end up."

326
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,048
Know what that means? This end up!

327
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,300
Why don't you try holding that end up?

328
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,140
All right, get away!

329
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,015
I'll do it myself. Get away.

- Move that...
- Excuse me.

- Morning.
- Morning.

333
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,990
Ah, I was dropped off on
the wrong side of the beach.

334
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,583
Could you take me over to the island?

We're taking the boat.
We're not going out there!

along this beach?

Excuse me, miss.

I'm going to insist
that you stop doing that.

606
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,629

she doesn't speak English.

Hello, Allen. How was your day?

608
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:58,096
I never went to college,

609
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,678
Thank you for letting me
use your television.

610
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,306
It was very educational.

611
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,183
It's all right, miss.

612
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,272
What's your name?

613
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,979
It's hard to say in English.

614
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,736
Well, just say it in your language.

615
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,110
All right. My name is...

I'm confused why you haven't
said anything until now.

00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:43,804
I didn't know English.

620
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:45,849
I see. Now you do?

621
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,601
I learned from television. It's wonderful!

622
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,274
I'll ask questions
and if you answer correctly,

623
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,226
you can win one of these prizes.

624
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,696
A wall clock,
matching washer and dryer,

625
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:57,990
or a brand-new car!

626
00:42:58,201 --> 00:42:59,908
Let me go first, okay?

627
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:02,320
Who are you? Where are you from?

628
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:06,787
Begin when you were born
and finish when you blew up the TVs.

629
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,007
Pretty.

630
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:21,506
Well, yeah.
I've never thought about it before.

631
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:23,974
Are you from Cape Cod?

632
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:29,180
No, I'm from another place.

633
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:32,558
Yeah? I've got a cousin from there.
Ha-ha-ha.

634
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,900
Are you an American?

635
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,815
No.

636
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:44,370
Then why were you in
Cape Cod and now New York?

637
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,701
How did the cops find you naked?

638
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,202
What's that?

639
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,367
What? The music?

640
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,541
I like music!
I heard some in the television,

641
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,963
<i>Dance Fever.</i>

00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,924
We better go, hon, or else we'll be late.

646
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:06,845
You never heard music?

647
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,385
What's that?

648
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:11,229

650
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:14,517
What's that?

651
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,646
It's a movie theater.

652
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,693
What the hell you doin'?
You could've got me killed!

653
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:20,189
Cut her some slack.
She's from out of town.

654
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,565
Keep her on a leash.

655
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,650
Yeah, yeah. Have a nice day.

Did you see this?

658
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,919
It's wonderfully delicious
and so good for you.

659
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:38,089
While you're here, watch a little less TV.

660
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:43,553
How long are you going to be in town?

661
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,928
Six fun-filled days.

662
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,263
Oh, six days.

663
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,011
Is that all?

664
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,682
Six days,

665
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:56,934
and the moon is full.

666
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,520
Oh.

667
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,649
The moon is full.

668
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:12,954
If I stay longer than that,
I can't ever go back.

669
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:15,460
Oh, I get... What?

670
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,254
Is there some sort of
immigration problem?

671
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,624
Where did you get that?

672
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:23,050
Where? Oh, for...

673
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:29,599
Sir? Here you are, sir. There you go.

674
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:33,220
I'm going to have to call you something
in English,

675
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:36,057
because I can't pronounce... What?

676
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,812
What are English names?

677
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,523
There's millions of them, I guess.

678
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,737
Jennifer, Joanie, Hillary.

679
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,485
Careful. Those are hot.

680
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,446
Names, names. Linda, Kim...

681
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,823
Where are we? Madison.

682
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:52,243
- Elizabeth, Samantha...
- I like Madison.

683
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,537
Madison's not a name.

684
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:59,338
Well, all right. Madison it is.

685
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,665
Good thing we weren't at 149th Street.

686
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:04,251
Are we going back to where you live?

687
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,179
Okay, um, here's the thing.

688
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:11,175
I was going to find you a hotel,

689
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,386
but I figure that after this afternoon...

690
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:18,353
Well, I just assumed that...

691
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:24,188
Would you mind staying with me?

692
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,782
I want to stay with you.

693
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,409

and you give us mermaids!

875
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:49,060
Don't call us.
Call the comic book companies.

876
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:52,981

in three weeks. Be ready.

Allen, you're here! I got you a present.

879
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:04,734
- Don't look. Close your eyes.
- I gotta close the door.

880
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,823
What are you doing?

881
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,079
All right.

882
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,582
Okay. Look.

883
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:22,760
Ha-ha! Wha... You, ah...

884
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:25,380
Well, that's big!

885
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:29,057
Yeah, this is...

886
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:35,022
This is very big, and it's really here.

887
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,604
It's just so big!

888
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,731
They were gonna tear it down,
so I bought it for you.

889
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,943
Where did you get
the money to pay for it?

890
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,784
Madison, where's your necklace?

891
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:50,450
I traded it for the statue.

892
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:51,780
Why?

893
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,034
Because I love you.

894
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,543
Oh, Madison.

895
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:05,552
Madison, I love...

896
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:07,513
This, ah, present.

897
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:09,886
I love it.

898
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:14,474
And I love you.

DR. ZIDELL: <i>What's happened to you?</i>

900
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:25,406
You were the brightest student
in my class.

901
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:29,319
True, emotionally,
you were 12 years old.

902
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:30,953
I was 12 years old.

903
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:32,496
That's right.

904
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,782
Look what you've become,

905
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:36,704
a schmuck.

906
01:02:37,963 --> 01:02:40,580
There is a mermaid in New York City.

907
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:45,088
You mean this naked girl?

908
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:47,590
How come she's got legs?

909
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:52,100
She has legs out of water
and fins in the water.

910
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:55,345
You taught me that, Dr. Zidell.
Remember?

911
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:58,063
You taught me all the legends.

912
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,565
You used to bring me in the office.

913
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:02,735
You used to show me charts
on the walls

914
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:05,529
where sailors had claimed
they saw mermaids.

915
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:11,036
Walter, that was for fun, for relaxation,
not for you to build your whole life on.

916
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:16,582
I'm gonna prove to you
and everyone else

917
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:19,209
that that girl is a mermaid!

918
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:21,537
How?

919
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:25,007
You gonna get her wet
so everybody sees she has fins?

- Is something the matter?
- No, nothing at all.

939
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,836
I was thinking.
You don't have to leave the country.

940
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:29,256
- I do.
- You don't.

941
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:33,086
There's stuff we can do
to get around the immigration laws.

942
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:36,889
For instance, I could give you a job
down at the market.

943
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,349
You could get a work visa.

944
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:44,222
Or, uh, you could, uh,

945
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:47,687
marry, like, an American,

946
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:50,152
and they have to let you stay.

947
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:52,024

Your nose is cold.

958
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:11,892
I don't want to talk about my nose.

and I guess I did it very badly.

to ask you if you wanted to get married.

969

01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:00,657
No.

You don't want to think about it,
kick it around?

01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,995
- I can't.
- Why?

974
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:11,580
I can't tell you.

975
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:16,291

you can tell me.

No, I've just seen them before.

988
01:09:15,735 --> 01:09:18,523
I guess they've been coming here
together for about 40 years.

They look very happy.

Why shouldn't they be happy, huh?

991
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:29,196
They get to spend
their whole lives together, don't they?

992
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:36,165
Is this really what happens
when water gets cold?

993
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,080
Yeah.

994
01:09:39,384 --> 01:09:41,626
Where I come from, it never gets cold.

Well, hey, what a breakthrough!

996
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:47,632
You just really opened up to me there.

where you come from either?

No.

1001

Well, they don't have anything,
do they?

They don't have ice, or music
or clothes.

- Not today.
- But see,

if we get the test today,
no pressure, mind you,

but if we get the blood test today,

1024
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,897
as soon as you tell me,
we can get married.

01:45:53,305 --> 01:45:57,299
<i>Once and forever</i>

1397
01:45:59,144 --> 01:46:03,309
<i>Love came for me</i>

1398
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:08,856
<i>One fine night</i>

1399

<i>Love let us see</i>

1400
01:46:16,829 --> 01:46:20,288

<i>No one ever saw before</i>

1404
01:46:40,102 --> 01:46:43,436
<i>It was the world</i>

1405
01:46:43,522 --> 01:46:46,310
<i>Love can start</i>

1406
01:46:47,026 --> 01:46:51,396
<i>With a beat of a heart</i>

1407
01:46:51,739 --> 01:46:55,733
<i>Love came for me</i>

1408
01:47:21,477 --> 01:47:25,096
<i>I saw stars</i>

1409
01:47:26,815 --> 01:47:31,526
<i>Shining in clear blue skies</i>

1410
01:47:32,696 --> 01:47:36,189
<i>We flowed together</i>

1411
01:47:38,452 --> 01:47:42,366
<i>Once and forever</i>

01:47:50,255 --> 01:47:53,714
<i>One fine night</i>

1414
01:47:56,011 --> 01:47:59,721

01:48:07,690 --> 01:48:11,229
<i>How good we'll be</i>

1417
01:48:13,612 --> 01:48:17,822
