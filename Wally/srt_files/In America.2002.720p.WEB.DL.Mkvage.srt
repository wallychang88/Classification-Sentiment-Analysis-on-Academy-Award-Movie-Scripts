1
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:35,868
There are some things
you should wish for...

2
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:39,038
and some things you shouldn't.

3
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,212
That's what my little brother
Frankie told me.

4
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,886
He told me I only had just three wishes.

5
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,432
And I looked in his eyes.

6
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,936
And I don't know why I believed him.

7
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:44,437
-Remember, we're on holiday, all right?
-Knock it off, Christy, love.

8
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,900
All those with U.S. passports,
use the two left lanes.

9
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:59,744
-Passports, please.
-We're on holidays!

10
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,248
-Are you, little girl?
-Yes. And my dad's not working.

11
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,181
What are your purposes
in visiting the U.S.?

12
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:21,307
We're on holidays.

13
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,101
-How long have you been in Canada?
-Just visiting.

14
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,853
Listening to my mom and dad...

15
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,980
We got the car in Canada.

16
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:31,526
...l was scared we weren't gonna
get across the border.

17
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:36,948
And if I didn't talk to Frankie,
how were we going to get into America?

18
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,328
'"Please, Frankie. Please.

19
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,747
'"Please help us, '"l said.

20
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,416
-How many children do you have?
-Three.

21
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,626
Two.

22
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,046
Two.

23
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:56,300
-it says three here.
-We lost one.

24
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,273
-What's your name, little girl?
-Ariel.

25
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:14,402
And who are you?

26
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,322
She's Christy.

27
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:21,742
-What age are you, Christy?
-She's 10.

28
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,750
-Welcome to America.
-Thanks very much.

29
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,596
And that was my first wish used up.

30
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,682
But I still had two left.

31
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,733
We heard Manhattan
before we ever saw it.

32
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:57,111
A thousand strange voices coming
from everywhere.

33
00:04:00,656 --> 00:04:02,783
And you're not going to believe this...

34
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,745
but we had to go under the water
to get to the city.

35
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:09,123
No,I swear it. it was a real alien.

36
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,168
And we lost contact with everything.

37
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,296
it was like we were on another planet.

38
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:37,151
...classics from the '60s, '70s,
'80s, and '90s....

39
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:59,400
We looked all over Manhattan
for a place to live...

40
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:04,113
until finally we found the house
of the man who screams.

41
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,078
What are you doing
with the camera, little girl?

42
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,040
-You the police?
-What?

43
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,416
Fingers.

44
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,544
-Are you the police?
-No, we're Irish.

45
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,422
-All Irish are police.
-We're not.

46
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,925
Are we going to live here now?

47
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,011
-You're gonna live in here in this building?
-Yeah.

48
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:32,308
All right. Keep an eye on the car.
Papo's gonna keep you safe now.

49
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,020
All right? Come on in.
Welcome to your new mansion.

50
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,276
Come on.

51
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,404
Look, a lift!

52
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,701
That hasn't worked forever. Come on.

53
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,882
-Are we going to live here now?
-Yeah.

54
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,343
-Why?
-Nowhere else will take us.

55
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,513
-Why?
-They don't want kids in Manhattan.

56
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:14,016
-Why?
-Why do you think it's called ''Man''hattan?

57
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,149
Papo, don't come any further, man.

58
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,444
Relax, Tony. it's just me.

59
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,197
I know who it is.
Go back downstairs to your apartment.

60
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,617
I’m clean, man. I’m showing this family
the empty apartment.

61
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,161
-No way, Papo.
-All right.

62
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,248
All right, Papo. We'll take over from here.

63
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,174
-Why does he scream?
-Maybe he sees ghosts.

64
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,926
Is this a haunted house?

65
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,770
-it's like Fort Knox.
-Cool.

66
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,023
-Where did you learn that?
-What?

67
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,400
-''Cool.''
-I just heard it.

68
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:07,403
You're American already. it's disgusting.

69
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,282
-Race you in, Christy.
-it's huge!

70
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,451
I know. it's enormous.

71
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,453
-This is my room.
-it's big, girls.

72
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,747
-This is my room.
-I get top bunk.

73
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,292
Look, Dad. There's a bath
in the middle of the room.

74
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,882
There's pigeons! Ariel, look at this.

75
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,719
-it's a bit of a hole.
-it'll be fine when we do it up.

76
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,931
it'll cost us, Sarah.

77
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,270
How are we gonna pay for this place?

78
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,773
We'll sell the car.

79
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,945
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, good.

80
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,530
-Are you?
-I’m great.

81
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,906
Are you?

82
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,037
-Dad?
-What?

83
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,373
Can we keep the pigeons?

84
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,794
Dad, can we keep the pigeons?

85
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,175
No, we have to leave them go.

86
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:27,233
it seemed like all our problems
were flying away.

87
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,202
-Dad, can I help?
-Go and ask your mom.

88
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,498
-Mom, can I help?
-Why don't you go on your skates?

89
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,168
I'll fast forward through this bit.

90
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:03,144
Ariel got to know everybody
in the neighbourhood.

91
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,404
My mom couldn't get a job teaching.

92
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:17,950
So she got a job in the ice-cream parlor
so Dad could go to auditions.

93
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,625
I really like the character.

94
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,877
I’m glad you asked me back.

95
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,922
I just wanna say
I'm real pleased about that.

96
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,759
Has he looked at the part of Vinny?

97
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,887
The New York guy?
He's a bit of a stereotype.

98
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,473
But if you want him, you got him.

99
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,018
Can you do a London accent?

100
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,271
You having a laugh?
He's only got two lines.

101
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,650
Do you want me to come up there
and sort you out?

102
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,321
-Do you like him?
-Yeah.

103
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:58,366
But acting's about more than just accents.

104
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,787
I wanted to cast you.
But you've got to give me much more.

105
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,580
Don't you understand?

106
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,292
Get it out of your head.
it's from here and from here.

107
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,753
Just give me one more chance.

108
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,714
But he didn't get another chance.

109
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:17,802
And then summer came.
And with it, the heat.

110
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,724
And a new word.; humidity.

111
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,355
-Dad, it's still not working.
-Wait.

112
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,946
it's too hot.

113
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:44,662
-it's still not coming through the holes.
-Hang on there.

114
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,168
Wait.

115
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,004
it's coming.

116
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,343
it's working.

117
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,976
-Well done, Dad. it's lovely and cold.
-I love you.

118
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,732
Ariel, Dad has an audition.

119
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,442
-Dad!
-What?

120
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,071
-What are you doing?
-I’m reading my scripts.

121
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,283
-Why?
-Because I’m learning my lines.

122
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,291
Dad, can we stay here all day?

123
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,131
-Dad, America's okay.
-Great.

124
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,926
-Dad?
-What?

125
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,719
Nothing.

126
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,532
What are we doing here?

127
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,461
Dad, Ariel's upset.

128
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:19,757
-She's been too long in the bath.
-What's wrong with you?

129
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,551
-My feet are like prunes.
-What?

130
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,135
They're like prunes.

131
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,680
Oh, Jesus. Where's your ma?

132
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,400
Are you okay?

133
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,947
it's too hot.

134
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:51,205
Dad, how are you gonna get that
air conditioner up and down the path?

135
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,459
Dad, how are you gonna....

136
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,714
Come on!

137
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,720
Dad, they're gonna shoot you.

138
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,856
-Dad, look out!
-Asshole!

139
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,779
Look, it's Dad.

140
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,954
-You're using, Papo.
-No.

141
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,748
Don't you walk....

142
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,045
Can I have some of whatever he's on?

143
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,255
Crazy, fucking Irishman.

144
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,867
Christy, open the door.

145
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:13,788
Mom, Dad's got an air conditioner!

146
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,957
He's coming!

147
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,129
-Walk away from me! Go on.
-Jesus! You'll have a heart attack.

148
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,883
-Open the window.
-Open the window, Mom !

149
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,270
What's wrong?

150
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,815
Wrong plug.

151
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:28,863
25cents short.

152
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,158
That's no use to me.
I got to make a living. $1 .99.

153
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,119
I’ll give it to you tomorrow.

154
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,915
-You're from the junkies' building, right?
-So?

155
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,042
Look at that.

156
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,879
That's from holding the knife of a junkie.

157
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,590
I got 25 stitches. He got probation.

158
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,263
Do I look like a junkie to you?

159
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,060
$1 .99.

160
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,671
-What's that?
-There's 5cents on each of those.

161
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,343
-Where's the $100Igave you?
-I put it in the bank like you insisted.

162
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,655
And 25 cents.

163
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,912
And $2. Mr. American Dream.

164
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,831
And one plug.

165
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,334
And 1 cent.

166
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,551
Dad, don't worry. Mom’s breathing's okay.

167
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,052
Is it okay?

168
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,514
it's the lemon drops. They're magic.

169
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:22,018
You take them,
and you forget about your breathing.

170
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,945
Say your prayers.

171
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,660
it's all right.

172
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,501
Go on, get your head in there.
Is that good?

173
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,461
Is that lovely? Yeah?

174
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,713
-Get a load of that!
-Get Christy!

175
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,925
Come on, get your face in there.
Look at that.

176
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,386
You're a genius, Dad.

177
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,187
Hey, gringo!

178
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,232
Gringo, what the hell's going on up there?

179
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,696
We got out of there as fast as we could.

180
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,951
We went to the bank,
took out our money...

181
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:24,038
and went to the movies
where it was lovely and cool.

182
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,989
Listen, don't be upset.
E.T.'s gone to Heaven.

183
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:02,326
-But they said he went home.
-Well, that's the same thing.

184
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,414
it's not.

185
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:12,837
I miss things.

186
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,466
What do you miss?

187
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,637
Things.I have no one to play with.

188
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:27,476
-You have your sister to play with.
-No. She plays with her camcorder.

189
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,439
And I have no one to tell my secrets to.

190
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,525
Christy telis them to her camcorder.

191
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,362
And she won't let me hear what she says.

192
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,617
And you don't play with us anymore.

193
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,498
-I do play with you.
-Not like you used to.

194
00:20:58,466 --> 00:20:59,926
Here you go!

195
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,807
Step right up,
pop the balloon to win a prize.

196
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,770
-Pick a number.
-Dad!

197
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:14,857
Dad, you can win E.T.!

198
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:24,033
it's a game of chance. it's as simple as pie.

199
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,994
Just throw the ball
through the hoop seven times...

200
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,997
-and you win E.T.
-Seven times? Is that all?

201
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,750
-Can adults play?
-Sure.

202
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,710
-Simple as pie.
-That's $2.

203
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,213
Keep throwing as long as
you double up your dollars.

204
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,049
lf you win, you get the money back
and any prize you like.

205
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:44,554
-You get all your money back if you win?
-Yes. And any doll you like.

206
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,184
Yes!

207
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:52,562
-That's one.
-Come on, Johnny.

208
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,611
-Two down. Five to go. $4.
-Come on, we'll get there.

209
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:03,197
Come on, Dad. You're excellent.
You're brilliant.

210
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:05,449
All right, don't worry. I’ll get it in.

211
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:09,036
-Mom, is Dad going to win?
-Of course he is, darling.

212
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,749
Come on, Dad.

213
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:16,752
Yes!

214
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,505
Three, four, five. Very good.
Only two to go.

215
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,429
$8.

216
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:31,559
Game of chance. Simple as pie.

217
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:34,562
You can keep throwing
as long as you double up your dollars.

218
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:35,813
Shit!

219
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,442
-Number five, two to go. $16.
-Let's go for it.

220
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:45,156
-Come on, Dad. Only two more to go.
-All right. I’ll get this. Don't worry.

221
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:51,412
$32. We got $32 over here.

222
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:55,333
-I don't need a crowd.
-Well, you're the main attraction.

223
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,632
Game of chance. Simple as pie.

224
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,230
$64. Are we finished, sir?

225
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,274
Angela. Over here.

226
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,736
I got $55.

227
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,114
-Here,I have another $5.
-Just need $4 more.

228
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:30,409
-Dad, it doesn't matter.
-No.

229
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:32,411
Just take it, Johnny.

230
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:36,332
And $1 change for the big girl.
Only one to go.

231
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,877
One ball to go for the big doll
for the little girl.

232
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:43,381
Don't let him break your
concentration, Johnny.

233
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:56,352
-Give me the rent money.
-What?

234
00:23:57,728 --> 00:24:01,691
-Give me the rent money.
-Please don't do this to me tonight.

235
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:05,319
I can't lose
in front of the kids again, Sarah.

236
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:26,632
Wait a minute. We got $128 over here.

237
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:29,010
Go on, Dad.

238
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:40,813
-We're finished now, sir.
-Leave it, please.

239
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,443
Go for it, man!

240
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:53,075
We can't blow all our money.

241
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:58,539
I believe in you, the kids believe in you,
and you can win that doll.

242
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:01,834
-Go on.
-You're gonna win.I just know it.

243
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:17,725
And then I used all my willpower
to quieten the crowd.

244
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:25,316
But it didn't work.

245
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,925
Every cent of every penny we owned...

246
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:54,470
was down for an E. T. doll worth $30.

247
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:57,765
So I said.;

248
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:02,353
'"Frankie,I have to ask you
for a second wish. '"

249
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:16,033
And to this day, my dad still believes
it was him who won the E. T. doll.

250
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:44,812
Fee, fie, foe...

251
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:46,397
fum !

252
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:50,359
I smell the blood of an Irishwoman!

253
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:54,530
Give me a bite of you!

254
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,658
Come on, Christy. Come on.

255
00:26:57,742 --> 00:26:59,202
Run, E.T.!

256
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:02,914
Help! Ariel!

257
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,460
Fee, fie, foe, fum !

258
00:27:07,752 --> 00:27:11,214
I smell the blood of an Irishwoman!

259
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:24,185
Run, E.T., it's the monster!

260
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:27,688
Fee, fie, foe, fum !

261
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:32,902
I smell the blood of an Irishman!

262
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:58,761
-Johnny, what's wrong?
-I was looking for him.

263
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,561
I was looking for Frankie.

264
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:12,400
Just play with the kids, Johnny.

265
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:16,237
I couldn't find him.

266
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:19,615
Am I going insane?

267
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:24,161
Just act, Johnny. Just act.

268
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,206
Go on, love.

269
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:36,549
Fee, fie, foe, fum !

270
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:42,555
I still smell the blood...

271
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,100
of an Irishwoman!

272
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:51,105
Come on, give me your finger.

273
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:55,151
Christy, I’ll save you!

274
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:07,997
No, get off her now, Dad!

275
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,544
You didn't find me.

276
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:16,631
I wasn't looking for you.

277
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:22,720
Exactly. You weren't looking for me.

278
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:27,808
There's nowhere you could hide
I wouldn't find you.

279
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:42,281
Fee, fie, foe, fum !

280
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:47,828
-Girls.
-I still smell the blood of an Irishwoman.

281
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:54,377
Take the bag. Take the money.
Go to Heaven. Marina will look after you.

282
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:58,840
I smell the blood of an Irishwoman.

283
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,263
-Hi, you two.
-How are you doing, girls?

284
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:08,474
You're a little later than usual.
Where's your mom?

285
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:11,310
My mom is playing with Dad on her own.

286
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:16,190
Fee, fie...

287
00:30:16,274 --> 00:30:19,902
foe, fum !

288
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:25,157
I smell the blood of an Irishwoman.

289
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:43,009
Fee, fie...

290
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:47,221
foe, fum !

291
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:50,558
I still smell the blood...

292
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:53,936
of an Irishwoman.

293
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,652
-Where are the kids?
-Leave it on.

294
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,823
it's all right. it's okay.

295
00:31:17,752 --> 00:31:19,545
-Where are the kids?
-They're fine.

296
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:21,881
They're in Heaven.
Marina's looking after them.

297
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,894
-Come on to me. Come on.
-No!

298
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:17,205
And that was the moment
the baby was conceived.

299
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:36,641
What's wrong?

300
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:40,895
Was it that good?

301
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:45,441
Was it that bad?

302
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:49,237
Look at me, Sarah.

303
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:54,534
Are you all right?

304
00:33:58,454 --> 00:33:59,956
What's wrong?

305
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:06,921
Come here to me.

306
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:09,215
I can't.

307
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:12,760
Come here to me.

308
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:19,016
Look at me and tell me the truth.

309
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:31,988
Frankie had your eyes, Johnny.

310
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:46,878
Say something.

311
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:53,426
You blame me.

312
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:59,849
I should have been there to catch him
when he fell down the stairs.

313
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,185
it's my fault.

314
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:05,313
I don't blame you.

315
00:35:50,942 --> 00:35:55,196
We had to go to a Catholic school.
So my dad took a night job.

316
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:59,200
Ariel was worried about a blind man
called José.

317
00:35:59,534 --> 00:36:02,286
Everybody smile and say ''cheese.''

318
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,830
Cheese!

319
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:07,333
Christy, why can José not see?

320
00:36:08,459 --> 00:36:10,044
it's not José, it's:

321
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:12,588
O say can you see

322
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:26,644
I helped, too.

323
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:29,605
Fill the bag with these, like that.
Yellow ones.

324
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:30,857
Okay.

325
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:41,409
Statue of Liberty.

326
00:36:41,492 --> 00:36:45,371
Nation, friends, and caring.

327
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:49,625
So now we're all together.

328
00:36:51,169 --> 00:36:52,420
I’m hungry!

329
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:54,839
Keep your eye on the meter.

330
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:57,466
And get in the cab
and keep your ear on the radio.

331
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,178
I won't be long. And lock the doors.

332
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:09,103
401 to Base. lf you can hear me, come in.

333
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:13,191
Hello, Base here. Where's your dad, girls?

334
00:37:13,566 --> 00:37:15,443
He's in his audition.

335
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:20,406
-Where are you?
-I’m not positive.

336
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:23,659
Christy, do you know where you are?

337
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:26,120
No.

338
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:28,581
Are you on Broadway?

339
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:30,625
-Yeah.
-I think so.

340
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:32,168
Near where?

341
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:36,422
-Near the audition.
-Yeah. Very good.

342
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:44,972
Is my baby all right?

343
00:37:48,017 --> 00:37:49,810
How are you feeling?

344
00:37:49,936 --> 00:37:53,564
Fine. A little bit tired.
But other than that, I’m okay.

345
00:38:14,544 --> 00:38:17,421
Mom, do you think
Dad will know who I am?

346
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:24,804
You look great. You'll knock them out.

347
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:30,309
-Can you guess what they are?
-Ariel's an angel.

348
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:34,230
Christy's a forest.

349
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:36,607
-She's autumn.
-No, fall.

350
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:40,862
That's what they call it here in America.
Fall. Like leaves fall.

351
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:43,281
You guys look great. They look great.

352
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:47,535
-Irish. Spare a quarter, please?
-I got a quarter.

353
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:50,997
You're the best.
He gave me a quarter, Angela.

354
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:53,040
He gave me a quarter.

355
00:38:53,124 --> 00:38:55,585
-There you go.
-Thank you, sir.

356
00:39:20,026 --> 00:39:23,279
-Who are they?
-That's the Irish.

357
00:39:24,906 --> 00:39:26,407
What's wrong?

358
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,748
Everyone else has bought their costumes.

359
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:37,877
-We look stupid.
-No, you don't.

360
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:48,471
And last but not least,
a special prize this year...

361
00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:52,391
for the best homemade costume
goes to the Sullivan sisters.

362
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:03,486
You can't throw away your prize.

363
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:06,656
-Best homemade costume.
-They made it up because they pity us.

364
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:09,867
-You got it 'cause you're different.
-We don't want to be.

365
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:11,994
We want to be the same
as everybody else.

366
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:14,497
Why would you wanna be the same
as everybody else?

367
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:18,084
-Everybody else goes trick-or-treating.
-What's that?

368
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:20,503
it's what they do here for Halloween.

369
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:22,964
Like ''Help-the-Halloween'' party?

370
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:25,216
No, not ''Help-the-Halloween'' party.

371
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:28,010
You don't ask for help in America.
You demand it.

372
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:30,555
Trick or treat. You don't ask. You threaten.

373
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:32,849
-You can't do that on our street.
-Why not?

374
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:36,936
Because you can't threaten
drug addicts and transvestites, that's why.

375
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:39,480
What are transvestites?

376
00:40:39,897 --> 00:40:42,316
A man who dresses up as a woman.

377
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:46,112
-For Halloween?
-No, all the time.

378
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:47,488
Come on.

379
00:40:48,698 --> 00:40:52,869
-Why?
-it's just what they do here, okay?

380
00:40:54,787 --> 00:40:58,875
We were allowed to go trick-or-treating
in our stupid building.

381
00:41:01,878 --> 00:41:05,089
Trick or treat!

382
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:11,637
-Dad, get out of here!
-Trick or treat!

383
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:14,640
Come on, let's try another door.

384
00:41:23,941 --> 00:41:26,319
Answer the fucking door.

385
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:32,783
-Why won't they answer?
-Maybe they're afraid.

386
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:41,876
We're nice kids, so let us in.

387
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:44,295
-How many doors is that?
-Four.

388
00:41:46,422 --> 00:41:48,257
Why am I so anxious?

389
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:53,596
it's the stairs, Johnny.

390
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:03,105
-it says ''keep away.''
-I don't care. Come on, Christy.

391
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,318
Trick or treat!

392
00:42:18,663 --> 00:42:20,414
Trick or treat.

393
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:28,047
Who's there?

394
00:42:29,841 --> 00:42:31,801
-Someone's in there.
-Oh, my God!

395
00:42:40,518 --> 00:42:42,854
No drugs here! Other door.

396
00:42:44,939 --> 00:42:46,983
Knock again.I dare you.

397
00:42:51,404 --> 00:42:53,573
-Trick or treat!
-Who....

398
00:42:58,786 --> 00:42:59,996
Go away!

399
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:05,084
What?

400
00:43:06,169 --> 00:43:07,378
Hello.

401
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:21,267
-Are you the kids from upstairs?
-Yeah.

402
00:43:26,314 --> 00:43:28,399
-Is this Halloween?
-Yeah.

403
00:43:31,944 --> 00:43:34,322
-Where are you from?
-Ireland.

404
00:43:34,822 --> 00:43:37,950
You came all the way to America
to trick-or-treat?

405
00:43:38,034 --> 00:43:39,202
Yeah.

406
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:44,582
Come in.

407
00:43:48,336 --> 00:43:51,172
-Are there only two of you?
-Two girls.

408
00:44:47,728 --> 00:44:49,981
Are they all right in there?

409
00:44:58,823 --> 00:45:00,491
They'll be fine.

410
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:14,797
-What's your name?
-Mateo.

411
00:45:14,797 --> 00:45:17,258
- What's yours?
- Ariel. Hello.

412
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,844
- My name's Christy.
- Hi, Christy.

413
00:45:19,927 --> 00:45:22,930
- Is that our building?
- Yes, it is.

414
00:45:25,892 --> 00:45:28,227
Looks like a haunted house.

415
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,940
It is haunted. But it's not scary.

416
00:45:34,192 --> 00:45:37,820
- It's a magic house.
- Frankie believed in magic.

417
00:45:39,113 --> 00:45:42,658
- Who's that?
- Frankie. Our brother. He died.

418
00:45:44,243 --> 00:45:47,121
He fell down the stairs when he was two.

419
00:45:48,664 --> 00:45:50,666
We thought he was okay.

420
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,961
But there was something in his brain.

421
00:45:54,629 --> 00:45:56,214
A brain tumour.

422
00:45:56,756 --> 00:45:59,717
And for three years
it got bigger and bigger.

423
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,511
It was malignant.

424
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:10,144
Are you crying?

425
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,401
Are you?

426
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,616
It's okay. He's in Heaven now.

427
00:46:25,618 --> 00:46:27,370
Is that your hand?

428
00:46:29,997 --> 00:46:32,834
- Yes.
- Is that blood?

429
00:46:39,841 --> 00:46:41,509
Spaghetti sauce.

430
00:46:42,927 --> 00:46:44,303
Come here.

431
00:46:47,056 --> 00:46:49,600
I better treat you or you'll trick me,
am I right?

432
00:46:49,684 --> 00:46:52,603
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's find something.

433
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:58,317
Let's see. So, what's in the fridge?

434
00:47:01,988 --> 00:47:03,531
Nothing.

435
00:47:10,496 --> 00:47:11,873
How about this?

436
00:47:13,749 --> 00:47:17,336
- How much is in it?
- A lot. Mateo's fortune.

437
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,714
- It's too much.
- No, it's not.

438
00:47:20,047 --> 00:47:23,050
When luck comes knocking on your door,
you can't turn it away.

439
00:47:23,134 --> 00:47:26,053
- Happy Halloween.
- Okay, happy Halloween. Bye.

440
00:47:27,138 --> 00:47:28,681
Hi, Dad!

441
00:47:31,934 --> 00:47:34,854
We're going to show Mam
what we got, okay?

442
00:47:50,328 --> 00:47:52,121
Happy Halloween.

443
00:47:52,705 --> 00:47:54,707
Happy Halloween, Mateo.

444
00:47:59,962 --> 00:48:03,257
He was really nice,
and he gave us lots of money.

445
00:48:03,633 --> 00:48:06,302
How much does it add up to, Christy?

446
00:48:06,886 --> 00:48:10,723
Two hundred and forty pennies,
twelve nickels, and two dimes.

447
00:48:10,806 --> 00:48:14,143
- How much is that all together?
- $3.20.

448
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,276
- And he had nothing in his fridge?
- Just medicine.

449
00:48:22,944 --> 00:48:25,071
We should invite him over.

450
00:48:25,863 --> 00:48:27,114
No way.

451
00:48:27,657 --> 00:48:30,034
He gives me the heebie-jeebies.

452
00:48:40,628 --> 00:48:43,881
- What is it?
- It's called colcannon.

453
00:48:44,632 --> 00:48:47,260
It's potatoes mixed with curly kale.

454
00:48:49,595 --> 00:48:51,722
Right. Plates, please.

455
00:48:55,476 --> 00:48:56,853
Thank you.

456
00:49:10,825 --> 00:49:13,536
Wow! That means you're gonna be rich.

457
00:49:19,542 --> 00:49:22,170
Halloween is called the Day of Ancestors.

458
00:49:22,253 --> 00:49:25,298
When the dead come back,
you hear their voices.

459
00:49:25,506 --> 00:49:27,383
How do you hear them?

460
00:49:28,426 --> 00:49:31,179
You hear their voices
through the men dancing.

461
00:49:31,429 --> 00:49:33,139
What do they say?

462
00:49:40,354 --> 00:49:41,898
They complain.

463
00:49:44,525 --> 00:49:47,028
"You don't pay attention to me.

464
00:49:48,654 --> 00:49:50,239
"You don't feed me.

465
00:49:51,741 --> 00:49:53,242
"I'm hungry."

466
00:49:54,827 --> 00:49:56,662
Are they ever happy?

467
00:49:57,705 --> 00:50:00,374
When they're happy,
you never hear from them.

468
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:25,233
You're magic. You're winning everything.

469
00:50:28,486 --> 00:50:31,113
That means you're gonna get married.

470
00:50:43,251 --> 00:50:44,544
Christy!

471
00:50:49,924 --> 00:50:51,384
Who's that?

472
00:51:14,448 --> 00:51:15,950
You see that?

473
00:51:20,872 --> 00:51:24,709
Do you not think I'm bad,
or are you just saying I'm good 'cause...

474
00:51:25,585 --> 00:51:26,878
You are.

475
00:51:30,506 --> 00:51:33,759
- Am I doing the wings nice?
- You're doing great.

476
00:51:33,843 --> 00:51:36,012
- Really?
- Yes.

477
00:51:36,304 --> 00:51:38,139
I thought I was bad.

478
00:51:40,474 --> 00:51:42,268
You're doing great.

479
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:47,523
- Is that you in the pictures?
- Yeah.

480
00:51:50,526 --> 00:51:52,278
So you were rich?

481
00:51:56,157 --> 00:51:58,868
Is that why the angel has blue blood?

482
00:52:04,373 --> 00:52:08,794
You know, in the Irish language,
the word for "black man" is fear gorm.

483
00:52:10,129 --> 00:52:12,507
But that really means "blue man."

484
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:16,928
The word for "black man" is fear dub.

485
00:52:17,386 --> 00:52:19,472
And that means "the Devil."

486
00:52:20,932 --> 00:52:23,226
You have us figured out?

487
00:52:43,621 --> 00:52:46,624
They can't wipe us out, they can't lick us.

488
00:52:47,041 --> 00:52:51,003
We'll go on forever, Pa,
'cause we're the people.

489
00:52:53,422 --> 00:52:55,883
"I said in mine heart, go to now...

490
00:52:56,592 --> 00:53:00,930
"prove thee with mirth,
therefore enjoy pleasure." Awesome.

491
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:04,433
Johnny, come to bed. It's late, come on.

492
00:53:06,143 --> 00:53:08,187
Put the script down now.

493
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:24,412
- You're happy.
- I am. It's something Mateo said.

494
00:53:26,247 --> 00:53:27,915
What's he say?

495
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:31,711
He said everything's gonna be all right.

496
00:53:33,671 --> 00:53:36,382
And the baby will bring its own luck.

497
00:53:39,343 --> 00:53:41,846
The baby will bring its own luck.

498
00:53:49,228 --> 00:53:51,689
That's it there. You see?

499
00:53:52,315 --> 00:53:54,108
I could be wrong...

500
00:53:54,942 --> 00:53:58,571
but I haven't felt the baby move
for a couple of weeks.

501
00:54:13,044 --> 00:54:14,545
It's serious.

502
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,220
This baby will not go full term.

503
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:27,683
And if it did, it would be
extremely dangerous to your health.

504
00:54:30,353 --> 00:54:34,482
If you decide to go ahead with this,
you'll have to be a very brave woman.

505
00:54:35,608 --> 00:54:39,737
But I thought the doctor said
you couldn't have any more babies.

506
00:54:40,363 --> 00:54:43,324
Sometimes, Ariel, doctors are wrong.

507
00:54:45,535 --> 00:54:48,996
There. It just kicked.

508
00:54:49,997 --> 00:54:51,415
Oh, my God!

509
00:54:53,793 --> 00:54:55,461
Johnny, feel it.

510
00:55:01,759 --> 00:55:04,470
I remember the first time
you kicked, Christy.

511
00:55:05,304 --> 00:55:07,849
It was in one of your dad's plays.

512
00:55:09,684 --> 00:55:12,270
Every time he spoke, you kicked.

513
00:55:13,437 --> 00:55:15,147
Like you were applauding him.

514
00:55:15,231 --> 00:55:19,610
- Did I ever kick?
- You kicked like a mule, night and day.

515
00:55:24,031 --> 00:55:25,783
There it is again.

516
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:29,787
Johnny, did you feel it?

517
00:55:39,297 --> 00:55:41,215
I can't feel anything.

518
00:55:53,394 --> 00:55:55,313
Do you want me to lie?

519
00:55:55,646 --> 00:55:58,649
You're the only actor in the world
who can't lie, Johnny.

520
00:55:58,733 --> 00:56:02,069
- Not even for the sake of your kids?
- What does that mean?

521
00:56:02,195 --> 00:56:04,405
If you can't touch somebody you created...

522
00:56:04,488 --> 00:56:07,408
how can you create somebody
that'll touch anybody?

523
00:56:07,533 --> 00:56:10,244
- What are you going on about?
- Acting, Johnny.

524
00:56:10,494 --> 00:56:13,247
And bringing something to life.
It's the same thing.

525
00:56:13,331 --> 00:56:17,335
That's why you can't get a job acting,
because you can't feel anything.

526
00:56:19,837 --> 00:56:22,215
This baby's not Frankie, Sarah.

527
00:56:29,847 --> 00:56:33,935
Look at me. Why don't you look at me?

528
00:56:39,106 --> 00:56:41,108
You've gotten over him.

529
00:56:47,073 --> 00:56:50,743
I had to get over him, Johnny,
for the sake of the kids.

530
00:56:51,327 --> 00:56:54,789
So you're gonna put your life on the line
for the sake of the kids?

531
00:56:54,872 --> 00:56:57,375
- And that's protecting them?
- Yes.

532
00:56:57,667 --> 00:57:00,253
- That's a total contradiction.
- How?

533
00:57:00,586 --> 00:57:02,922
You know what the doctor said.

534
00:57:04,757 --> 00:57:07,009
I don't care what they said.

535
00:57:08,469 --> 00:57:11,430
What do they know about us?
And my baby?

536
00:57:14,058 --> 00:57:16,018
I gotta fucking get out of here.

537
00:57:16,102 --> 00:57:18,145
Where are you going?

538
00:57:18,229 --> 00:57:19,856
- This is real.
- No!

539
00:57:19,939 --> 00:57:22,859
This is real. It's not a fucking play!

540
00:57:22,942 --> 00:57:25,361
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?

541
00:57:25,444 --> 00:57:26,988
- Let me get out.
- No.

542
00:57:27,196 --> 00:57:29,115
You'll upset the kids!

543
00:57:32,326 --> 00:57:34,412
I'll be back in a minute.

544
00:57:35,413 --> 00:57:40,001
Johnny, come back.
Johnny, where are you going?

545
00:57:40,418 --> 00:57:42,879
Johnny, you're scaring me. Come back.

546
00:57:43,337 --> 00:57:46,132
Just come back. Johnny, please.

547
00:58:11,282 --> 00:58:14,827
All right? Everything all right?

548
00:58:34,722 --> 00:58:37,683
The baby will bring its own luck, will it?

549
00:58:38,893 --> 00:58:42,939
I'll tell you the luck the baby will bring.
The baby could infect her...

550
00:58:43,105 --> 00:58:45,775
and two giris will be left without their ma.

551
00:58:46,484 --> 00:58:48,486
So keep your trap shut.

552
00:58:50,112 --> 00:58:51,864
You don't believe.

553
00:58:57,453 --> 00:58:58,746
In what?

554
00:59:03,042 --> 00:59:04,168
God?

555
00:59:06,462 --> 00:59:08,798
You know, I asked him a favour.

556
00:59:09,257 --> 00:59:12,009
I asked him to take me instead of him.

557
00:59:13,261 --> 00:59:15,429
And he took the both of us.

558
00:59:17,098 --> 00:59:19,600
And look what he put in my place.

559
00:59:26,065 --> 00:59:29,318
I'm a fucking ghost. I don't exist.

560
00:59:30,528 --> 00:59:34,407
I can't think. I can't laugh. I can't cry.

561
00:59:35,283 --> 00:59:37,159
I can't fucking feel!

562
00:59:43,499 --> 00:59:45,293
Do you wanna be me?

563
00:59:45,918 --> 00:59:49,380
- Do you wanna be in my place?
- I wish.

564
00:59:55,887 --> 00:59:57,972
Are you in love with her?

565
01:00:03,019 --> 01:00:06,355
- Are you in love with her?
- No.

566
01:00:10,568 --> 01:00:12,445
I'm in love with you.

567
01:00:18,242 --> 01:00:21,162
And I'm in love
with your beautiful woman.

568
01:00:21,537 --> 01:00:23,915
And I'm in love with your kids.

569
01:00:24,957 --> 01:00:27,960
And I'm even in love
with your unborn child.

570
01:00:33,716 --> 01:00:36,385
I'm even in love with your anger!

571
01:00:38,471 --> 01:00:41,182
I'm in love with anything that lives!

572
01:00:50,816 --> 01:00:52,318
You're dying.

573
01:01:03,287 --> 01:01:04,664
I'm sorry.

574
01:02:16,402 --> 01:02:17,987
That's Frankie.

575
01:03:42,905 --> 01:03:44,574
I'm just scared.

576
01:03:47,201 --> 01:03:51,622
It's gone. I can't make-believe anymore.

577
01:03:53,541 --> 01:03:56,627
Sometimes, I think our entire lives
are make-believe.

578
01:03:58,504 --> 01:04:00,381
This is make-believe.

579
01:04:02,175 --> 01:04:04,719
The air I breathe is make-believe.

580
01:04:06,304 --> 01:04:10,266
Just make believe you're happy, Johnny.
Please, for the kids.

581
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:16,230
"Now is the winter of our discontent

582
01:04:16,564 --> 01:04:20,151
"Made glorious summer
by this sun of York

583
01:04:20,902 --> 01:04:24,488
"And all the clouds that there are around

584
01:04:25,198 --> 01:04:29,327
"dance to the lascivious pleasings of a lute

585
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:32,705
"Now is the winter of our discontent

586
01:04:33,206 --> 01:04:37,210
"Made glorious summer
by this sun of York"

587
01:04:39,712 --> 01:04:40,755
So I'm a little high...

588
01:04:40,838 --> 01:04:44,300
Sometimes, it seemed like everyone
in New York was an actor.

589
01:04:45,134 --> 01:04:46,594
Even the stockbrokers.

590
01:04:46,677 --> 01:04:48,721
You might not think it to look at me...

591
01:04:48,804 --> 01:04:51,474
and I know I'm white and everything,
but I can rap.

592
01:04:51,557 --> 01:04:54,936
Help, somebody!
Somebody call an ambulance!

593
01:04:56,771 --> 01:05:01,317
Come on, man. Somebody, help!

594
01:05:02,944 --> 01:05:04,779
He's fallen down the stairs!

595
01:05:04,862 --> 01:05:07,365
I think someone's fallen down the stairs.

596
01:05:08,199 --> 01:05:10,493
I think it's Mateo. Get your coat.

597
01:05:21,921 --> 01:05:24,590
It's Mateo. Will I get the lemon drops?

598
01:05:24,674 --> 01:05:26,968
- Yeah, and a pillow.
- Okay.

599
01:05:27,051 --> 01:05:29,720
Mateo! Did anyone call for help?

600
01:05:29,804 --> 01:05:31,180
He just fainted.

601
01:05:32,056 --> 01:05:34,058
Keep the dog away, man, keep him away.

602
01:05:34,141 --> 01:05:37,228
- Go downstairs.
- Stevie doesn't let me. He'll lock me out.

603
01:05:37,311 --> 01:05:41,315
That's because you're a junkie, Papo.
Go and get an ambulance.

604
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,984
Don't do that.

605
01:05:43,901 --> 01:05:47,071
- I did this to my brother.
- No. It's different.

606
01:05:48,531 --> 01:05:50,241
Come on, come on.

607
01:05:54,328 --> 01:05:55,830
Are you okay?

608
01:06:10,178 --> 01:06:13,598
- Are you okay?
- Can't seem to catch my breath.

609
01:06:13,681 --> 01:06:16,350
- Just relax.
- Here.

610
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:21,522
- What are they?
- They're lemon drops. They're magic.

611
01:06:21,981 --> 01:06:25,067
If you suck on some,
they'll make you better.

612
01:06:26,277 --> 01:06:28,821
- Is that right, Christy?
- Yeah.

613
01:06:30,364 --> 01:06:32,950
My mom takes them to help the baby.

614
01:06:36,204 --> 01:06:38,706
I think you saved my life, Ariel.

615
01:06:50,551 --> 01:06:53,054
All right, that's it.
Get out of the fucking cab!

616
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:59,393
What are you talking about?
I was right in the middle of a flow.

617
01:06:59,477 --> 01:07:02,313
Come on, what the hell
is the matter with you, you freak?

618
01:07:02,396 --> 01:07:04,273
Where's the Bill of Rights?

619
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:09,195
- Get the fuck off me, you piece of shit.
- Take your fucking handbag!

620
01:07:10,988 --> 01:07:12,406
Night, E.T.

621
01:07:12,782 --> 01:07:14,033
Are you awake, Ariel?

622
01:07:14,116 --> 01:07:16,452
- Yeah. Are you, Christy?
- Yeah.

623
01:07:17,828 --> 01:07:20,873
- What's wrong with Mateo?
- Some disease.

624
01:07:20,998 --> 01:07:23,000
- Will you get it?
- What?

625
01:07:24,418 --> 01:07:26,087
Mateo's disease.

626
01:07:29,298 --> 01:07:32,176
- Why?
- Because you kissed him.

627
01:07:35,555 --> 01:07:36,639
No.

628
01:07:36,931 --> 01:07:40,142
- Night, Christy.
- Night.

629
01:08:30,109 --> 01:08:31,569
There's Dad.

630
01:08:43,956 --> 01:08:46,083
Get him, Frankie, get him.

631
01:09:34,173 --> 01:09:35,508
You okay?

632
01:09:40,054 --> 01:09:42,139
I was just out of breath.

633
01:09:53,442 --> 01:09:55,361
What was Frankie like?

634
01:09:57,864 --> 01:09:59,240
A warrior.

635
01:10:07,999 --> 01:10:09,834
What does that mean?

636
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:15,423
A warrior who's not afraid
to go to the other side.

637
01:10:15,798 --> 01:10:17,800
The other side of what?

638
01:10:21,095 --> 01:10:22,263
This.

639
01:10:24,098 --> 01:10:25,391
Hi, Dad.

640
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,690
Ladies and gentlemen, we are not alone.

641
01:10:33,733 --> 01:10:36,861
Here on this little ball we call the Earth...

642
01:10:37,195 --> 01:10:39,739
we have friends among us.

643
01:10:47,997 --> 01:10:50,499
Don't be scared. He's not too well now.

644
01:10:50,583 --> 01:10:52,877
Did he not take the lemon drops?

645
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,880
I don't think they agree with him anymore.

646
01:11:18,402 --> 01:11:20,321
Why do you have sores?

647
01:11:30,748 --> 01:11:35,336
If I tell you a secret,
will you tell nobody else?

648
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:37,129
No, I won't.

649
01:11:41,551 --> 01:11:45,513
I'm an alien. Like E.T.

650
01:11:51,644 --> 01:11:53,688
From a different planet.

651
01:11:55,398 --> 01:11:58,276
My skin is too sensitive for this Earth.

652
01:11:59,193 --> 01:12:00,278
Right?

653
01:12:01,821 --> 01:12:03,990
The air is too hot for me.

654
01:12:06,409 --> 01:12:08,703
Are you going home like E.T.?

655
01:12:11,622 --> 01:12:13,708
I suppose I'm going home.

656
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:16,544
When are you going?

657
01:12:29,015 --> 01:12:30,183
Soon.

658
01:12:31,726 --> 01:12:33,895
Will you say goodbye to me?

659
01:12:36,731 --> 01:12:38,774
- I will.
- Promise?

660
01:12:42,403 --> 01:12:44,572
Yes, I promise.

661
01:12:46,866 --> 01:12:48,701
Mom’s having a baby.

662
01:12:50,745 --> 01:12:53,372
What do you think we should call it?

663
01:12:55,124 --> 01:12:57,627
We're going to call it after you.

664
01:13:10,723 --> 01:13:12,558
I think he's asleep.

665
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:18,272
My mom had to go into hospital...

666
01:13:18,356 --> 01:13:22,485
so I thought about using my third wish.
But I had to be careful.

667
01:13:23,152 --> 01:13:26,280
If the baby came too soon,
the baby might die.

668
01:13:26,572 --> 01:13:29,825
And if the baby came too late,
my mom might die.

669
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:33,579
You have to be careful what you wish for.

670
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:38,167
Come on, kids, time to go.
See you later, all right?

671
01:13:38,251 --> 01:13:39,544
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

672
01:13:39,627 --> 01:13:41,712
- Take it easy, love.
- See you tomorrow.

673
01:13:41,796 --> 01:13:44,674
- Bye.
- Love you.

674
01:13:48,052 --> 01:13:50,096
Excuse me, Mr. Sullivan?

675
01:13:50,763 --> 01:13:52,849
We'll need that check by Friday.

676
01:13:53,057 --> 01:13:55,434
- For how much?
- $5,000.

677
01:13:56,143 --> 01:13:58,896
All right, okay. That's great. Thanks.

678
01:14:02,483 --> 01:14:06,779
You know the situation.
You know I'm in trouble.

679
01:14:08,489 --> 01:14:10,324
- Come on.
- "Shut up.

680
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:14,370
"Look into my eyes.
What are they telling you?

681
01:14:15,413 --> 01:14:17,415
"They're telling you no.

682
01:14:19,375 --> 01:14:23,129
"You either do the job
or you get out of town. Understand?"

683
01:14:24,922 --> 01:14:28,301
- I understand.
- That was good, Dad.

684
01:14:30,428 --> 01:14:32,513
Yeah, it wasn't so bad from you.

685
01:14:33,514 --> 01:14:35,266
You're gonna get it, Dad.

686
01:14:37,101 --> 01:14:39,103
- Do you think so?
- Yeah.

687
01:14:41,564 --> 01:14:43,733
Will we sell the camcorder?

688
01:14:44,650 --> 01:14:45,735
No.

689
01:14:48,571 --> 01:14:52,658
Don't be worrying, girl.
Everything's gonna be okay.

690
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:02,460
Hey, Irish. Irish!

691
01:15:06,506 --> 01:15:10,134
Hey, Johnny.
Haven't seen you for seven days.

692
01:15:10,259 --> 01:15:13,179
- That means you owe me $7.
- Jesus, not again.

693
01:15:13,262 --> 01:15:16,057
A dollar a day keeps Frank away.
Hey, I'm joking.

694
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:17,350
I've no money.

695
01:15:17,558 --> 01:15:20,144
No, no. I got something for you.

696
01:15:21,979 --> 01:15:23,397
Here, here.

697
01:15:24,023 --> 01:15:26,651
- What are they?
- They're food stamps.

698
01:15:27,693 --> 01:15:30,988
- I'm all right, thanks.
- Come on, you helped me out.

699
01:15:31,072 --> 01:15:34,575
I'm just trying to help you out for once.
Come on, take them.

700
01:15:35,451 --> 01:15:38,037
You can't take something from me?
Take the stamps.

701
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,206
Come on, take the stamps.

702
01:15:43,626 --> 01:15:45,795
- Thanks.
- No problem, Irish.

703
01:15:55,429 --> 01:15:57,682
Come on then. Tuck you in.

704
01:15:58,099 --> 01:16:01,435
Dad? Who's gonna iron
our school uniforms?

705
01:16:01,769 --> 01:16:03,437
Daddo the baddo.

706
01:16:05,523 --> 01:16:06,774
- Dad?
- What?

707
01:16:06,858 --> 01:16:10,862
- I need money for school.
- I have that sorted. It's all right.

708
01:16:11,237 --> 01:16:12,697
- Okay.
- Okay?

709
01:16:12,822 --> 01:16:14,824
- Night, Dad.
- Good night.

710
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:19,745
Dad. You forgot to say Christy's prayer.

711
01:16:21,539 --> 01:16:24,125
- I don't know it.
- I'll say it.

712
01:16:26,085 --> 01:16:28,462
- All right.
- Kneel.

713
01:16:30,506 --> 01:16:32,425
- What?
- Will you kneel?

714
01:16:34,177 --> 01:16:37,054
No. I'm not kneeling, no.

715
01:16:38,973 --> 01:16:42,518
- Mom always kneels.
- But dads are different.

716
01:16:47,565 --> 01:16:50,818
- I want Mom.
- Christy, do the prayer, would you?

717
01:16:51,903 --> 01:16:56,449
No monsters, no ghosts.
No nightmares, no witches.

718
01:16:57,241 --> 01:17:00,411
No people coming into the kitchen,
smashing the dishes.

719
01:17:01,787 --> 01:17:05,583
No deviis coming out of the mirror,
no dolis coming alive.

720
01:17:07,001 --> 01:17:10,171
Mateo going home, Frankie in Heaven.

721
01:17:10,713 --> 01:17:13,674
The baby not coming too early or too late.

722
01:17:15,468 --> 01:17:19,764
Mom, Dad, Christy, and Ariel,
all together in one happy family...

723
01:17:20,056 --> 01:17:22,600
and all well with the world. Amen.

724
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:26,604
You're great girls.

725
01:17:27,063 --> 01:17:29,065
I'll see you in the morning.

726
01:17:29,148 --> 01:17:31,192
- Night, Dad.
- Night, Dad.

727
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:40,368
- How much does it cost in the hospital?
- Thousands and thousands.

728
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:42,119
Good night.

729
01:17:43,538 --> 01:17:45,373
"To be, or not to be..."

730
01:17:45,623 --> 01:17:47,750
Blah, blah, fucking blah.

731
01:17:49,377 --> 01:17:51,587
"Whether it be nobler in the mind"...

732
01:17:51,671 --> 01:17:54,382
to stick my head in the fucking oven
and end it all?

733
01:17:54,465 --> 01:17:55,925
Where's Dad?

734
01:18:02,682 --> 01:18:04,225
I want my dad.

735
01:18:05,893 --> 01:18:08,437
- I am your dad.
- You're not my dad.

736
01:18:09,146 --> 01:18:10,940
I want my real dad.

737
01:18:11,274 --> 01:18:13,776
- Come here.
- Stay away from me.

738
01:18:14,569 --> 01:18:17,405
- Come here to me.
- Where's Mom?

739
01:18:17,488 --> 01:18:21,158
- What did you do with Mom?
- I'll get Mom. Come here, baby.

740
01:18:21,242 --> 01:18:23,661
No! Mom!

741
01:18:37,508 --> 01:18:38,885
Come here to me.

742
01:18:42,763 --> 01:18:45,266
Look at me, look at me.

743
01:18:47,268 --> 01:18:50,396
- Am I your dad?
- No.

744
01:18:51,856 --> 01:18:54,150
Here, look. Look at me.

745
01:18:57,403 --> 01:18:58,905
Am I your dad?

746
01:19:02,116 --> 01:19:03,326
Maybe.

747
01:19:07,538 --> 01:19:10,333
So spring came. And with it, the baby.

748
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:12,668
It had come too soon.

749
01:19:24,639 --> 01:19:26,724
Can you get Karen for me?

750
01:19:28,976 --> 01:19:32,230
Please don't let my baby come.
I don't want my baby to come.

751
01:19:32,313 --> 01:19:35,816
No, it's too early. It's too early!

752
01:19:42,573 --> 01:19:43,908
Coming through, stat.

753
01:19:43,991 --> 01:19:45,368
I need a morphine drip.

754
01:19:47,328 --> 01:19:48,996
Nurse, morphine.

755
01:19:49,413 --> 01:19:51,916
Johnny, why is my baby not crying?

756
01:19:51,999 --> 01:19:55,086
- Just go with the baby, go with the baby.
- I'm going.

757
01:20:15,606 --> 01:20:17,984
We've stabilized her for now...

758
01:20:18,276 --> 01:20:22,113
but she will need a blood transfusion
in the next couple of hours.

759
01:20:33,374 --> 01:20:34,750
All right?

760
01:20:36,544 --> 01:20:41,132
Everything's gonna be okay.
The baby needs a blood transfusion.

761
01:20:43,009 --> 01:20:47,054
We have to sign this consent form.
The pair of us.

762
01:20:48,848 --> 01:20:50,349
Is that okay?

763
01:20:58,232 --> 01:21:02,069
All the blood is bad.
Mateo said all the blood is bad.

764
01:21:02,904 --> 01:21:05,531
You're not giving my baby bad blood.

765
01:21:08,034 --> 01:21:10,203
You gave my baby bad blood.

766
01:21:11,579 --> 01:21:15,416
And that's why he died.
That's why he fell down the stairs.

767
01:21:17,919 --> 01:21:20,171
This is the new baby, Sarah.

768
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:29,514
He tried to climb the gate. And he fell.

769
01:21:31,516 --> 01:21:33,434
Why did you put it up?

770
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:39,232
- Where is he?
- Who?

771
01:21:39,357 --> 01:21:40,650
Frankie.

772
01:21:42,944 --> 01:21:45,238
Frankie's not with us, Sarah.

773
01:21:59,043 --> 01:22:01,671
You should have taken the gate down.

774
01:22:03,297 --> 01:22:07,218
It's your fault.
You should have taken the gate down!

775
01:22:07,885 --> 01:22:09,971
- You're hiding him.
- No, I'm not.

776
01:22:10,805 --> 01:22:14,350
- I want to get Frankie. I want my baby!
- Calm down, all right?

777
01:22:15,226 --> 01:22:19,313
- Where is he? I want Frankie.
- Easy. Easy, now. Doctor!

778
01:22:19,730 --> 01:22:22,358
It's your fault he fell down the stairs.

779
01:22:22,441 --> 01:22:24,652
Could you ring your bell there? Doctor!

780
01:22:24,735 --> 01:22:27,613
Why didn't you take the gate down?

781
01:22:27,697 --> 01:22:29,532
- It's all right.
- No, please.

782
01:22:29,615 --> 01:22:32,243
Please, I'm begging you, please.
Johnny, please.

783
01:22:32,326 --> 01:22:35,663
No, no, please. I want to see my baby.

784
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,708
- Please don't take my new baby.
- I'm not taking her.

785
01:22:38,791 --> 01:22:42,003
- Save my baby, Johnny, please.
- I promise.

786
01:22:49,844 --> 01:22:51,095
I will.

787
01:22:54,557 --> 01:22:57,435
If the baby dies, just don't wake me up.

788
01:23:04,233 --> 01:23:07,403
- There's only one other solution.
- What's that?

789
01:23:08,321 --> 01:23:10,781
- Are you O-negative?
- I am.

790
01:23:13,034 --> 01:23:14,911
Christy's O-negative.

791
01:23:17,622 --> 01:23:20,625
- What if I have it?
- Have what?

792
01:23:22,793 --> 01:23:24,462
Mateo's disease.

793
01:23:27,507 --> 01:23:29,800
That's not possible, Christy.

794
01:23:30,843 --> 01:23:32,720
How do you know, Dad?

795
01:23:33,179 --> 01:23:35,348
God won't let that happen to you.

796
01:23:36,432 --> 01:23:38,518
You don't believe in God.

797
01:23:40,603 --> 01:23:43,689
- I'm scared.
- Don't be scared.

798
01:23:44,232 --> 01:23:45,942
Everyone's dying.

799
01:23:53,574 --> 01:23:57,036
- Will she survive it?
- She can't survive without it.

800
01:24:00,289 --> 01:24:03,459
That's what the doctors said
before they opened Frankie.

801
01:24:04,418 --> 01:24:08,464
- What do we do?
- I'll give her the blood.

802
01:24:10,091 --> 01:24:11,884
Is that a decision?

803
01:24:13,553 --> 01:24:15,638
Christy will give her the blood.

804
01:24:24,188 --> 01:24:26,315
Are you okay, little girl?

805
01:24:29,235 --> 01:24:31,237
Don't "little girl" me.

806
01:24:31,946 --> 01:24:35,283
I've been carrying this family
on my back for over a year.

807
01:24:35,867 --> 01:24:37,910
Ever since Frankie died.

808
01:24:39,495 --> 01:24:41,497
He was my brother, too.

809
01:24:42,665 --> 01:24:46,586
It's not my fault that he's dead.
It's not my fault that I'm still alive.

810
01:24:46,669 --> 01:24:47,962
Christy.

811
01:24:50,423 --> 01:24:53,092
Mom was always crying
because he was her son.

812
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:59,015
But he was my brother, too.
I cried, too, when no one was looking.

813
01:25:00,975 --> 01:25:04,228
- And I talked to him every night.
- She did, Dad.

814
01:25:08,858 --> 01:25:13,196
- I talked to him every night until...
- Until when?

815
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:20,620
Until I realized I was talking to myself.

816
01:25:28,336 --> 01:25:30,129
Listen, I'll take her home, okay?

817
01:25:30,213 --> 01:25:32,757
- All right. Thanks very much.
- No problem.

818
01:25:34,717 --> 01:25:36,511
Your check bounced.

819
01:25:44,185 --> 01:25:48,481
I sat there with my dad, and all the noises
of New York disappeared.

820
01:25:51,192 --> 01:25:54,111
All I could hear
was the blood thumping in my ear.

821
01:25:55,655 --> 01:25:57,823
But for some reason, I felt happy.

822
01:25:59,742 --> 01:26:04,247
I wondered if Frankie
had felt like this. ; special.

823
01:26:06,207 --> 01:26:09,669
Everybody looking at you
like they were looking in a mirror.

824
01:26:10,127 --> 01:26:13,256
And smiling. Except in their eyes.

825
01:26:18,010 --> 01:26:20,388
Did Frankie know he was going to die?

826
01:26:21,472 --> 01:26:24,183
Is that why he kept nodding
and smiling at us?

827
01:26:51,085 --> 01:26:53,254
When he died, I cursed God.

828
01:26:54,672 --> 01:26:57,383
I told him,
"You're not gonna see these snotty tears...

829
01:26:57,466 --> 01:27:00,094
"running down my cheeks ever again."

830
01:27:02,346 --> 01:27:04,182
So now, I can't cry.

831
01:27:10,521 --> 01:27:13,316
I thought I'd come in here...

832
01:27:15,109 --> 01:27:18,404
and you'd wake up, you'd hold my hand.

833
01:27:20,781 --> 01:27:24,118
I'd cry, and the kid would be all right.

834
01:27:25,453 --> 01:27:27,538
Everything would be okay.

835
01:27:35,254 --> 01:27:37,340
We need a miracle, Mateo.

836
01:27:39,926 --> 01:27:42,053
Hey, Irish, whoa.

837
01:27:47,517 --> 01:27:49,352
You can't say hello?

838
01:27:50,144 --> 01:27:52,647
What? What's up?

839
01:27:53,981 --> 01:27:57,568
- I'm sorry, man.
- A bad day?

840
01:27:58,402 --> 01:28:01,781
- You could say that.
- Yeah, the whole world had a bad day.

841
01:28:04,575 --> 01:28:07,537
Joe, come on, give me a few bucks.

842
01:28:09,497 --> 01:28:12,208
- Come on.
- I don't have any money to give you.

843
01:28:13,209 --> 01:28:16,671
I'm sorry. I'm stupid.
I shouldn't be bothering you.

844
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:20,716
Come on, lighten up, Joe.
It's gonna get better.

845
01:28:22,593 --> 01:28:26,889
Come on, Irish. Fighting Irish.
I'm coming to get you.

846
01:28:28,766 --> 01:28:30,685
Just give me some money.

847
01:28:30,768 --> 01:28:33,396
I'm not doing this for me. It's for Angela.

848
01:28:33,688 --> 01:28:36,440
Come on, put your hand in your pocket.

849
01:28:36,774 --> 01:28:39,944
- Take it easy.
- Your other pocket.

850
01:28:41,612 --> 01:28:45,199
Your other pocket. Faster, Irish.
Let me see it.

851
01:28:46,325 --> 01:28:47,743
Get it out.

852
01:28:48,452 --> 01:28:50,788
- I don't know what it is.
- Take it out.

853
01:28:50,872 --> 01:28:54,292
I'm taking it out. Okay, there you go.

854
01:29:02,633 --> 01:29:04,177
I just needed money.

855
01:29:05,136 --> 01:29:06,512
I'm sorry, okay?

856
01:29:07,930 --> 01:29:09,765
Okay, that's enough.

857
01:29:16,772 --> 01:29:21,068
Stop it. I'm sorry. Joe, I'm sorry.

858
01:29:27,742 --> 01:29:31,954
- Hey, Joe. We're still friends?
- Go to hell.

859
01:29:35,708 --> 01:29:39,337
We were waiting for the baby
to show some sign of life.

860
01:29:40,463 --> 01:29:43,007
She just lay there and lay there.

861
01:31:56,724 --> 01:32:00,353
The hospital bill arrived. It came to. ;

862
01:32:00,645 --> 01:32:04,857
$30,420.20.

863
01:32:05,274 --> 01:32:08,069
Look, just get me in the door
for the audition.

864
01:32:08,569 --> 01:32:10,321
I'll give them whatever they want.

865
01:32:10,404 --> 01:32:12,448
Sir. Your bill is ready.

866
01:32:13,449 --> 01:32:14,825
All right.

867
01:32:19,539 --> 01:32:21,749
- Bill's been paid.
- What do you mean?

868
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:27,004
A Mateo Kuamey paid it.

869
01:32:29,507 --> 01:32:31,300
There's no balance.

870
01:32:35,179 --> 01:32:39,183
See, see my playmate
Come back

871
01:32:39,267 --> 01:32:41,727
Finally, my dad got a part in a play.

872
01:32:41,936 --> 01:32:44,272
And he came to tell us the good news.

873
01:32:44,355 --> 01:32:46,190
Since 1982

874
01:32:46,274 --> 01:32:47,900
Got some good news, girls.

875
01:32:47,984 --> 01:32:51,112
Sarah Mateo Sullivan is coming home
from the hospital.

876
01:32:54,156 --> 01:32:55,575
Cool, yeah!

877
01:32:59,829 --> 01:33:02,373
- Look who it is.
- How are you doing there?

878
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:04,250
- You want a look?
- Yeah.

879
01:33:04,792 --> 01:33:07,086
- Mom, can I?
- Yeah, grand.

880
01:33:14,177 --> 01:33:15,803
Okay, see you later.

881
01:33:16,888 --> 01:33:18,556
Big yawn.

882
01:33:40,578 --> 01:33:42,079
What's wrong?

883
01:33:43,039 --> 01:33:45,333
- He never said goodbye.
- What?

884
01:33:45,958 --> 01:33:47,877
He never said goodbye.

885
01:34:43,641 --> 01:34:45,393
The baby's asleep.

886
01:34:50,147 --> 01:34:51,440
Christy.

887
01:34:57,947 --> 01:34:59,615
Come here to me.

888
01:35:04,412 --> 01:35:07,206
Look up there and tell me what you see.

889
01:35:08,165 --> 01:35:09,250
A full moon.

890
01:35:09,333 --> 01:35:11,419
And what else do you see?

891
01:35:13,129 --> 01:35:14,338
Stars.

892
01:35:14,797 --> 01:35:16,716
Can you not see Mateo?

893
01:35:19,051 --> 01:35:21,762
He's going past the moon on his bike.

894
01:35:22,638 --> 01:35:25,349
I think he's waving goodbye to Ariel.

895
01:35:25,933 --> 01:35:27,643
- Will we tell her?
- Yeah.

896
01:35:39,614 --> 01:35:41,365
Look up there.

897
01:35:41,449 --> 01:35:44,035
That's Mateo riding past the moon
on his bike.

898
01:35:44,118 --> 01:35:45,786
- Where?
- There, look.

899
01:35:45,870 --> 01:35:48,664
- Can you not see him waving to you?
- No.

900
01:35:49,832 --> 01:35:54,170
- He's right there.
- He's there, flying past the moon.

901
01:35:55,755 --> 01:35:57,548
- Can you see him?
- No.

902
01:35:57,632 --> 01:36:00,760
Can you not see him waving to you?
He's waving goodbye.

903
01:36:00,843 --> 01:36:02,762
Just like he promised.

904
01:36:03,095 --> 01:36:05,139
Oh, yeah. Bye, Mateo.

905
01:36:05,223 --> 01:36:08,643
- Bye, Mateo.
- Bye, Mateo.

906
01:36:09,352 --> 01:36:12,313
Bye, Mateo. Look after Frankie.

907
01:36:13,689 --> 01:36:16,275
- Look after Frankie.
- Look after...

908
01:36:21,989 --> 01:36:24,575
And then I asked for my third wish.

909
01:36:26,953 --> 01:36:29,205
Say goodbye to Frankie, Dad.

910
01:36:31,290 --> 01:36:32,458
What?

911
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:35,962
Say goodbye to Frankie.

912
01:36:42,635 --> 01:36:46,639
- Bye, Frankie.
- He can't hear you, Dad.

913
01:36:55,523 --> 01:36:57,233
Goodbye, Frankie.

914
01:37:14,625 --> 01:37:16,294
Get out of here.

915
01:37:27,930 --> 01:37:29,265
Dad wants you.

916
01:37:58,169 --> 01:38:02,089
It was as hard for Frankie to smile,
when the tumour was malignant...

917
01:38:03,549 --> 01:38:06,093
as it was for my dad to cry after.

918
01:38:06,928 --> 01:38:09,013
But they both managed it.

919
01:38:12,058 --> 01:38:14,560
I'm going to switch this off now.

920
01:38:15,728 --> 01:38:18,564
It's not the way
I want to see Frankie anymore.

921
01:38:32,411 --> 01:38:35,164
Do you still have a picture of me
in your head?

922
01:38:36,499 --> 01:38:39,669
Well, that's like the picture
I want to have of Frankie.

923
01:38:41,003 --> 01:38:43,881
One that you can keep
in your head forever.

924
01:38:46,467 --> 01:38:49,011
So when you go back to reality...

925
01:38:50,763 --> 01:38:52,557
I'll ask Frankie...

926
01:38:54,225 --> 01:38:58,229
to please, please, let me go.
