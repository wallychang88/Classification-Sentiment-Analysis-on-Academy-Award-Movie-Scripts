Six people died.

526
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,725
Two crew, four passengers.

527
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,729
Who on the crew?

528
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,902
Uh, listen, the protocol is...

529
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,320
Who on the crew, Charlie?

530
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,198
The protocol is
that the NTSB has to be the first

531
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,741
to make contact with you. I can't...

532
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,577
And that agent's here, so

533
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,081
let me go get him. It's a bit of a show.

534
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,249
So, just... There's half a dozen of them.

535
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,085
All right?

536
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,670
(DOOR OPENING)

00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,590

Captain William Whitaker?

540
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,651
Nod if you can hear me
and understand me.

541
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,654
I'm Craig Matson from the NT... NTSB.

542
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,657
And I am required
as the lead on the Go Team

543
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,075
to make initial contact with you

544
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:07,328
after a major incident
like the one you had today.

545
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:11,499
You are in a hospital in South Atlanta.

546
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:16,504
Are you aware that
the plane you were piloting went down?

547
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:23,094
I have a doctor here who can explain
your medical situation.

548
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,346
I'm Dr. Kenan.

549
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:28,516
And the good news is
you're in good condition.

550
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:29,684
You did suffer a concussion,

551
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,854
you have numerous lacerations
around your left eye.

552
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,355
We're going to
keep the patch on for a few days.

553
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,940
Just as a precaution.

554
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,859
Your eye seems to be okay.

555
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,112
Now, the MRIs show
that you have some strained tendons

556
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,864
in your left knee and ankle,

557
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,199
and you have no broken bones.

558
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,285
But you have some
deep bruising in your left thigh

559
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,871
and some torn ligaments
in your left wrist.

560
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:51,831
Nothing serious.

561
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,958
So, as soon as we clear
your concussion

562
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,710
and you feel well enough,
you can go home.

563
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:59,839
That may take a day,
maybe three. Okay?

564
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:07,346
I won't ask too much of you tonight,

565
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:12,226
but as I said, the NTSB is
required to make initial contact.

566
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,898
How much do you remember
about the flight?

567
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,569
Um, I remember, uh...

568
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:26,407
I remember everything up till the crash.

569
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:27,825
Okay.

570
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,911
Mr. Whitaker, that's fine.

571
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:33,289
I am required
to inform you that this incident

572
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,082
did result in the loss of life.

573
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,586
The current information states that

574
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:42,507
of the 102 souls on board, we lost six.

575
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,926
Two crew members
and four passengers.

576
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,345
Fifty-nine people
were treated and released,

577
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,596
37 people remain...

578
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,765
Who did we lose on the crew?

579
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,767
The two flight attendants,

580
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:56,312
Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez.

The rep from your pilots' union,

582
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,110
Mr. Anderson, will be
our contact for you.

583
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,197
It's important that
you follow your union's guidance

584
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,032
on press and media.

585
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:11,285
The pilots' union works
closely with the NTSB.

586
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,288
So, I'm going to head out.

587
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,706
I'll turn this off.

588
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,959
- Good luck, Mr. Whitaker.
- Thank you.

590

We spent some time together.

591
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,813
Yeah, apparently,
she wasn't strapped in.

592
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,692
A survivor reported
she was assisting a kid.

593
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,653
Margaret Thomason, how's she doing?

594
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:48,239
Broken collarbone, just, I mean, cuts.

595
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,408
I mean, she's banged up, but she's...

596
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,326
She's here, too. She's fine.

597
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,704
And Ken Evans, your copilot,

598
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,040
he took a bad shot to the head.

599
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,086
And they're keeping him in a coma
just to let the brain swelling go down,

600
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,504
but we feel good about him.

601
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:05,798
He's going to be okay.

and women of the flight crew.

You just saved 100 people...

698
00:36:58,425 --> 00:36:59,508
Harling!

699
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,344
- You bring my smokes?
- Yes, I did.

700
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,470
I got your fucking message,

701
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,599
and, yes,
I got your fucking smokes right here.

702
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:07,683
Here's a fresh carton.

703
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,060
You smoke your nuts off, champion.

704
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,771
Hell, if I was you, I'd fire up right
here in the goddamn room.

705
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:14,857
Here. I got you a pint of vodka,

706
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:16,400
I got you some Red Bulls.
You know what I'm saying?

707
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,484
I know my customer.

708
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,153
Take the vodka with you.

709
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:20,613
What... Take the vodka? What are you...

710
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,031
I'm not drinking anymore.
Take it with you.

711
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,449
I'll just tuck it...

712
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,659
- Take the fucking vodka with you.
- Okay. All right.

713
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,913
Listen, but you
got to come get me tomorrow. Okay?

714
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,957
And... (GROANS)

715
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:34,376
I want you to go by my condo,

716
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:39,214
pick me up some clothes
and my phone charger.

717
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,674
Look in my refrigerator

718
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,218
and pick up a package
that says "veal" on it.

719
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:44,887
- It's marked "veal."
- Veal.

720
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,305
In the freezer. It's marked "veal."

721
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,057
Done and done.
What time do you want me here?

722
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:49,141
I'll call you.

723
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,267
Okay. You give a mayday,

724
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:52,227
you're out of here in seven minutes. Oh!

725
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,105
Oh, I almost forgot.
I got you some stroke mags.

726
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,191
I've been in the hospital before,
I know what you need.

727
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,027
I got Juggs,
Hot MILFs in Heat, AssMasters.

728
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,071
You just stroke it all day, you're a hero.

729
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,948
If I was you,

730
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,450
I'd just lay here
pulling on that thing all day long.

731
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,620
You know what I'm saying?
There's a smile. Yes, sir.

732
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:21,799
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

733
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:24,885

734
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,137
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

735
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:34,436
Damn it.

736
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:41,610
(THUNDER CRASHING)

737
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,018
Devious minds think alike.

738
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,604
Don't go.

739
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,983
I'll be quiet and just...

740
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:23,777
It's nice to

741
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,572
just sit and smoke with somebody.

742
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:34,329
Were you on that plane?

743
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,832
Yeah, I was.

744
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,292
You?

745
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,628
You must have been sitting at the back.

746
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,134
Yeah, way in the back.

747
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,511
MAN: (SINGING) Tobacco's
but an Indian weed

748
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,097
Grows green in the morn
Cut down in the eve

749
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:55,350
Shows our decay 'cause we are but clay

750
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,812
I love the smell
of nicotine in the morning.

751
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,481
(CLEARS THROAT)

752
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,691
It smells like victory.

753
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,693
Can I bum one?

754
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:10,449
I should quit.

755
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,243
My cancer might get cancer.

756
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,081
Joke. Hmm? (CHUCKLES)

757
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,500
Were you in the plane crash?

758
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:20,793
NICOLE: He was.

759
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,380
Holy shit, man! You're the fucking pilot!

760
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,174
Ha!

761
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,842
What happened up there?

762
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,554
Okay. Yeah. I'd... Mmm.

763
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:35,849
Tough deal, man, but you walked away.

764
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,601
Or you limped away.

765
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,938
Yeah, I'm lucky. Going home tomorrow.

766
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:42,523
Home?

767
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,608
Home for me is the basement.

768
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,944
They keep cancer treatment
in the basement.

769
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,987
What kind of cancer you got?

770
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:52,157
Fibromyxoid sarcoma.
Soft tissue sarcoma.

771
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:54,701
Very rare. God chose me.

772
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,745
You believe that?

773
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:59,164
Fuck, yeah, bitch.

774
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,750
You're a stupid fucker
if you don't believe in God.

775
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,336
Once you realize all the random
events in your life are God,

776
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,755
you will live a much easier life.

777
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,424
We spend all our time
trying to control all these things

778
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,218
that happen to us, it's bullshit.

779
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,387
The plane you're flying goes down?

780
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,513
Out of your control.

781
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,432
God gives you cancer?
I got no control over that.

782
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,809
Did God give me cancer?

783
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,853
You bet your ass God gave me cancer.

784
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,020
You know, do you think

785
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:23,897
God would have
given me cancer if I'd asked for it?

786
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,482
Uh, I don't think so,

787
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:28,360
'cause I begged him
to take it away and guess what?

788
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,155
No control over that, either.

789
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,033
What are you doing here, honey?

790
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,368
You're beautiful, you know that?

791
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,413
Do I scare you?

792
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:45,252
People are either drawn to me,
or they pretend like they can't see me.

793
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:47,963
It's a trip.

794
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,756
They think because
I'm close to the other side,

795
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:52,009
I got some sort of power or wisdom.

796
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,719
Like I got all the answers.

797
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,554
I don't know, maybe I do.

798
00:41:56,764 --> 00:42:00,267
Death gives you perspective.
It all makes sense, somehow.

799
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,145
(LAUGHS) And I just can't get over
how beautiful you are.

800
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,274
I can see your arm. Are you an addict?

801
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,111
Yeah.

802
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,113
What's your name?

803
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:15,449
Nicole.

804
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:17,993
What do you do in the world, Nicole?

805
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,454
(CHUCKLES) Not much.

806
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:23,957
I was a photographer,
and then I was a masseuse,

807
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:27,127
and now I sometimes
wash hair in a salon.

808
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,296
Oh, yeah? Where is it?

809
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:31,590
I'm gonna come by. I'm real easy,
you just wash my head.

810
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:32,799
(CHUCKLES)

811
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:36,970
You think you're going to die?

812
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:50,442
Don't you just love her?

813
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:52,945
Don't know her.

814
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:55,489
Bullshit. I do.

815
00:42:56,658 --> 00:43:00,244
Random act of God? I don't think so.

816
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:04,248
You survive a plane crash
to meet a beautiful woman in a stairwell.

817
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,167
Fuck you, man.

818
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,294
(DOOR OPENS)

819
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,506
Probably looking for me.

820
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:14,883
My family just flew in from Utah.

821
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,344
You know it's bad
when they start flying in.

822
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,512
Hmm.

823
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,473
(INHALES SHARPLY) It's a trip.

824
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,184
'Cause every morning is special now.

825
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,520
I'm grateful for that.

826
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,856
I wish I could bottle
this feeling that I have

827
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:33,193
about how beautiful
every last breath of life is.

828
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,488
(LAUGHS)

829
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,366
Mmm. You think I could get one more,
just for the road?

830
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,493
Here. Take the pack.

831
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:44,538
Mmm!

832
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:48,208
Thank you.

833
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:50,794
I'll pass these out
in the cancer ward. Mmm.

834
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:54,339
Nicole. You're going to be okay.

835
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,265
Chemo brain.

836
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,226
Makes you pretty foggy.

837
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:07,644
Oh, yeah?

838
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:09,396
They call it chemo brain.

839
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:13,567
My momma, she used
to slur her words and get all chatty.

840
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,736
Your mom had cancer?

841
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,406
Breast cancer. She was only 54.

842
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:23,076
Is that why you think you're going to die?

843
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,665
Heroin addicts who use needles,
they tend to die.

844
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,084
Especially women, for some reason.

845
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,420
I read that in a pamphlet.

846
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:38,925
A woman from AA, she just came
to see me whilst I was in rehab.

847
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,096
That guy was a trip, huh?

848
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:44,765
Yeah.

849
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,892
He made it feel like, I don't know.

850
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,772
Like you and me
were the last people left on this planet.

851
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,777
And together we'll save the world.

852
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:58,445
(CHUCKLES)

853
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,280
(CHUCKLING)

854
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:10,999
Where do you live, Nicole?

855
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:14,795
Why? You want to come visit me?
It's luxurious.

856
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:17,798
I live in Bankhead, near the bus station.

857
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,466
I'll come visit you.

858
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:21,426
- You're sweet.
- I will.

859
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,137
What's your address?

860
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,809
I live at the Georgian Terraces,
on Taylor Street.

861
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:30,060
Okay.

862
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:33,772
And you say you're a masseuse?
What kind of masseuse?

863
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,984
I've been every kind
of masseuse there is.

864
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,280
Good luck, Nicole.

865
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,660
(TIRES SQUEALING)

866
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:50,747
HARLING: I couldn't find any suitcases.

867
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:52,165
I put all your shit in garbage bags.

868
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,667
No, thanks.

869
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:59,172
You're staying with me
down on University, right?

870
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,174
It's nice.

871
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:04,052
A lot of young people. Good vibe.

872
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,347
No, I'm going to the farm.

873

As you know, when a plane goes down,

the NTSB sends a Go Team
to the crash site immediately.

939
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,680
They find the flight data recorder?

Uh... So... That doesn't mean anything.

1000
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:24,988
I had a couple of beers
the night before the flight.

1001
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,781

It's not gonna be me, I promise you that.

1013
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:52,181
As long as they're writing checks,
tell them to write one for me, too.

1014
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,058
Because someone put me
in a broken plane.

Felonies punishable by
up to 12 years in prison.

1019
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,362
And if it is proven that your intoxication

1020
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:08,281
was the cause of the death
of the four passengers,

1021
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:11,159
now we're gonna look at
four counts of manslaughter.

1022
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:13,578
That could be life in prison.

00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:17,623

do my job on your behalf

1024
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:20,334

Trust me. Trust him.

1028
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,391
You don't have to worry,
you'll walk away from this the hero.

1029
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:37,143
I'm not worried, Charlie.

1030
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:40,563
I promise you that I'm not worried.

1031
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,691
No one could have landed
that plane like I did.

- Excuse me.
- BARTENDER: Yes.

Yeah, let me have an orange juice.

1230
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:24,159
we don't want to see
your airline go away.

1231

1235

My clients don't go to jail, Mr. Carr.

1236

Oh, he's going to jail. He belongs in jail.

1237
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:42,678
You bet your ass he's going to jail.
The only question is,

1238
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:44,847

01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:18,068
I'm just trying to get this thing straight.

1382
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:21,029
Now you think any other pilot could have
landed that plane and saved more lives?

1383
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:22,364
I didn't say that, Whip.
I can't imagine another...

1384
01:18:22,448 --> 01:18:23,448
All right, then.

1385
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:26,242
Well, imagine your son,
Trevor, in this church,

1386
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:27,535
looking at you in that box.

1387
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:29,621
Or my son visiting me in prison. And...

1388
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,916
- Please, Whip, enough. Enough, Whip.
- And for the next 40 years...

1389
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,460
Don't you think we've all had enough?

1391
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:44,928

1393
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:54,145
What do you want me to say?

1394
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:57,357
(SIGHS) I just...

1395
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:01,236
It was an ordinary day.

1396
01:19:03,823 --> 01:19:07,158
The storm, after we took off,

1397
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:09,160
was very severe.

1398
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:13,498
But as far as
the flight crew was concerned,

1399
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:17,127
it was a perfectly ordinary day.

1400
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:40,191
- Hey.
- Hi.

1401
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:41,359
Ah...

1402
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:44,279
You okay?

1403
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:45,864
Uh... Yeah, yeah.

1404
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:48,366
So?

1405
01:19:48,576 --> 01:19:50,827
Well, I got through my first day.
They didn't fire me.

1406
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:52,162
- So...
- Good. Good.

1407
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:55,832
And they need someone to work
the night shift and they asked me.

1408
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:57,542
It's time and a half, so...

1409
01:19:57,668 --> 01:19:59,043
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

1410
01:20:00,004 --> 01:20:01,296
I got a vest.

1411
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:03,590
- And a little name tag.
- Nice.

1412
01:20:03,674 --> 01:20:04,674
I got you something.

1413
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:05,925
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1414
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:09,345
Oh...

1415
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:11,723
It's a P-51 Mustang.

1416
01:20:11,849 --> 01:20:12,891
I know it's a P-51 ...

1417
01:20:13,017 --> 01:20:14,058
Your daddy fly one of those?

1418
01:20:14,185 --> 01:20:15,351
Yes, he did.

1419
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:18,021
It's cause for celebration.

1420
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:21,691
Oh, well, I promised Sheila that
I'd go to this AA meeting now.

1421
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:24,194
She's my sponsor,
the one that's been helping me.

1422
01:20:24,278 --> 01:20:25,695
Can we celebrate tomorrow night?

1423
01:20:26,197 --> 01:20:27,238
Yeah.

1424
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:29,032
Yeah, sure, come on.

1425
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,079
You know, you could come with me.

1426
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:36,789
To the meeting.

1427
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:39,709
It's an open meeting,
meaning that anyone can come.

1428
01:20:40,211 --> 01:20:41,711
Even you.

1429
01:20:43,214 --> 01:20:45,673
So the cops got a flashlight
on me behind the dumpster.

1430
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:47,300
I'm wearing nothing
but my girlfriend's panties,

1431
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:50,053
I got vomit all down
the front of my chest.

1432
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:53,640
And I say to them,
"Uh, I might have had two beers."

1433
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:55,725
(ALL LAUGHING)

1434
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:03,900
So that's how
I got the nickname "Two Beer Barry."

1435
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:09,030
I'm getting the stink eye
from Ed over here.

1436
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:11,074
Have I gone off format?

1437
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:14,244
My name is Barry and I am an alcoholic.

1438
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:15,620
ALL: Hi, Barry.

1439
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:18,748
Are there any other alcoholics present?

1440
01:21:24,255 --> 01:21:25,588
I always Iove a meeting where we

1441
01:21:25,673 --> 01:21:27,131
all have to identify at the top,

1442
01:21:27,258 --> 01:21:30,969
because it forces me
to be honest about who I really am.

1443
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:34,973
And I never told the truth
out there, obviously.

1444
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:37,100
I Iied about everything.

1445
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:40,687
I was taught in these rooms
that I would never get sober

1446
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:43,648
if I kept Iying,
but that's what I was best at.

1447
01:21:45,985 --> 01:21:48,069
If I knew anything
in this world it was how to Iie,

1448
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:50,113
especially about my drinking.

1449
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:54,826
But, whatever. I would Iie
about the name of my dog,

1450
01:21:54,952 --> 01:21:58,621
I'd Iie about the color of my own hair
right to your face.

1451
01:21:59,999 --> 01:22:01,791
And my whole Iife just became

1452
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:05,169
a series of Iies strung together by me,

1453
01:22:05,296 --> 01:22:06,921
- one after the other.
- I'm going to go, okay?

1454
01:22:07,006 --> 01:22:08,423
- Sure.
- You got a ride home?

1455
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:11,342
Uh, yeah. Sheila, she can give
me a ride. This is Sheila.

1456
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:13,303
- How you doing?
- I'm Sheila.

1457
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:16,306
BARRY: ...that my Iies would kill me.

1458
01:22:16,974 --> 01:22:18,224
Left to their own devices,

1459
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:21,477
my Iies would walk me out that door.

1460
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:31,154
MORGAN: Is it safe to say that Captain
Whitaker remains a bit of a mystery?

1461
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,364
KEN: Those are your words, sir,
not mine.

1462
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:34,824
MORGAN: I've been speaking
to some people

1463
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:36,993
who are very close
to the NTSB investigation.

1464
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:39,704
They are confident they will
soon be able to determine

1465
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:42,040
exactly what brought this plane down.

1466
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:43,708
I'm sure they will, sir.

1467
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:47,211
MORGAN: Well, Ken and Vicky Evans,
thank you both very much.

1468
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:49,505
KEN: Thank you, sir. And God bless you.

some privacy, please?

1479
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:41,391
- Out of a coma?
- Yeah.

1480
01:23:42,393 --> 01:23:43,726
Two days.

1481
01:23:46,105 --> 01:23:47,271
Good.

You were brilliant on CNN, by the way.

01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:07,083
Both my legs are crushed.
My pelvis is snapped.

1487
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:09,627
I'll probably never walk again,

1488
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:12,255
at least not without a walker or braces.

1489
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:15,133
I'll certainly never fly again.

1490
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:18,261
I'm very sorry, Ken.

1491
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:22,265
KEN: That plane was doomed
the moment you sat in that cockpit.

1492
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:25,268
You reeked like gin or something.

1493
01:24:26,437 --> 01:24:29,439
I called Vicky
from the plane before we took off.

1494
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:32,442
That's when the rain kicked up.

1495
01:24:34,445 --> 01:24:38,614
Well, I don't know
how much you remember,

1496
01:24:39,116 --> 01:24:40,616
but that plane,

1497
01:24:41,452 --> 01:24:43,119
it started falling apart, Ken.

1498
01:24:43,454 --> 01:24:45,913
I remember everything until we crashed.

1499
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:47,623
I know what went on.

1500
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:51,794
What are we trying to say, Ken?

1501
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:53,629
What are we talking about?

1502
01:24:54,131 --> 01:24:55,673
I don't know, Captain Whitaker.

1503
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:56,966
What are we talking about?

1504
01:24:57,176 --> 01:25:00,136
I'm just trying to get a sense from you

1505
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:05,475
about what you thought
caused the crash.

1506
01:25:06,477 --> 01:25:10,313
Was it the fact that you got on the plane
still drunk from the night before?

1507
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:16,986
The NTSB is coming back tomorrow
to finish taking a deposition from me.

1508
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:19,989
About the events on that flight.

1509
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:24,327
Do you think you'd be alive
if I wasn't flying that plane?

1510
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:26,829
No.

1511
01:25:27,331 --> 01:25:28,998
We'd all be dead.

1512
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:33,211
But are you going to argue with me
that your physical state was tip-top?

1513
01:25:39,343 --> 01:25:40,510
Wait.

1514
01:25:41,345 --> 01:25:42,512
Sit.

1515
01:25:43,347 --> 01:25:44,514
Please.

1516
01:25:50,187 --> 01:25:53,397
I never shared my opinion
about your physical state

1517
01:25:53,524 --> 01:25:55,024
the morning of the flight.

1518
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:58,027
I never said a word.

1519
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:00,071
Okay.

1520
01:26:00,197 --> 01:26:02,532
That crash was preordained.

1521
01:26:04,034 --> 01:26:08,037
I prayed on it, Captain.
Vicky and I both prayed on it.

There is only one judge, sir.

And he's got a higher plan for you.

This event,
although it's tragic in its loss of life,

1526
01:26:21,385 --> 01:26:24,053
it's also a celebration of life.

Will you pray with us?

Jesus, our savior, we thank you
for blessing Captain Whitaker.

on that fateful morning.

Yes, I am.

1554
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:52,683
It was beautiful. It was like a postcard,

1555
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:56,854
you know, like one of those
picture postcards.

1556
01:27:56,939 --> 01:28:00,650
White sand, beautiful, sky-blue seas.

1557
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:03,986
It was the most
beautiful thing I ever saw.

1558
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:07,156
Was the water warm?

1559
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:09,492
Yes, it was very warm.

1560
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:11,494
That's my kind of place.

1561
01:28:12,663 --> 01:28:14,038
Let's go.

1562
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:17,208
Sure. Why not? (CHUCKLES)

1563
01:28:17,334 --> 01:28:19,168
Yeah. Let's go tomorrow.

1564

- Oh, you're serious.
- I'm dead serious.

1565
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:22,380
We'll go in the morning.

1566
01:28:22,506 --> 01:28:23,923
You know, we'll just get out of here.

1567
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:25,549
- Start over.
- Whip, we can't. No.

1568
01:28:25,676 --> 01:28:28,636
Yes, we can. It'll be beautiful.

1569
01:28:29,096 --> 01:28:30,304
Bright sand beaches...

1570
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:31,889
- I'm worried about you.
- It's...

1571
01:28:32,015 --> 01:28:33,849
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine. Thank you.

1572
01:28:34,184 --> 01:28:36,477
- You're not. You're really not.
- Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

You need help.

1574
01:28:39,189 --> 01:28:41,190
You need rehab, Whip.

You think I need rehab?
So, you go to two AA meetings

1576
01:28:45,779 --> 01:28:48,114

Don't worry about me, okay?

1579
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:54,537
You just worry about yourself.
Don't worry about me.

1580
01:28:54,788 --> 01:28:55,788
We're the same, you and me.

1581
01:28:55,914 --> 01:28:56,914
- No, we're not the same.
- Yeah, we are.

1582
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,834
We are not the same.
I don't suck dick to get high, okay?

- That's not fair.

- Yes, I do.

You choose it? Well, I don't see
a whole lot of choice going on here!

I choose to drink! And I blame myself!

I'm happy to! And you know why?

1598
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:29,113
Because I choose to drink!

1599

It's a good day. We've won.

It's no longer a question
of your condition,

Fantastic. That's what I've been
trying to tell everybody.

So why are we here? We're good.

1665
01:34:45,889 --> 01:34:48,557
Uh... Because there is a small problem.

1666
01:34:48,767 --> 01:34:52,102
Because of turbulence,
there was no drink service on the flight,

1667
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:56,523
but they did find two empty
vodka bottles in the galley trash.

1668
01:34:56,608 --> 01:34:58,108
Yeah, um...

1669
01:34:58,568 --> 01:35:00,652
And there's no physical
evidence on the bottles.

No DNA, no fingerprints
to link them to anyone,

but they were uncapped and empty.

1672
01:35:05,575 --> 01:35:07,326
And the only people
who would have had access

1673
01:35:07,452 --> 01:35:10,621
to those bottles would be the flight crew.

placed them in simulators,

to this plane falling out of the sky.

were able to safely land the planes?

1889
01:49:52,795 --> 01:49:53,962
WHIP: Yeah, I'm dead!

get an ambulance?

1891

- No, no, no. No. No.
- No.

1893
01:49:59,551 --> 01:50:01,886
Let's just get him to the bed. Come on.

1894
01:50:02,221 --> 01:50:03,554
Come on. That's all right.

HUGH: That's it, Charlie.

1896
01:50:05,224 --> 01:50:07,225
Okay? That's it.
We're fucked, man. He just fucked us.

1897

Your guy just fucked us, Charlie.

make sure nobody comes in.

We've got 45 minutes, okay?

01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:18,236
How much grace you think we've got?

1903
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:19,821
Grace? Ellen Block?

1904
01:50:19,905 --> 01:50:21,489
We're going to get some fucking grace?

1905
01:50:21,573 --> 01:50:22,824
(STAMMERING) Well,
we probably got an hour before

1906
01:50:22,908 --> 01:50:24,409
we really gotta get him downstairs.

1907
01:50:24,493 --> 01:50:25,785
Okay. Great.
Well, let's just get a wheelchair

1908
01:50:25,869 --> 01:50:26,995
and wheel his ass into the hearing!

Captain Whitaker, good morning.

1995
01:55:44,730 --> 01:55:45,771
Morning.

1996
01:55:45,856 --> 01:55:46,814
(COUGHS) Morning.

1997
01:55:46,898 --> 01:55:48,858
ELLEN: What that video captures is that

1998
01:55:48,942 --> 01:55:51,402
the aircraft
was in a relatively stable glide

1999
01:55:51,486 --> 01:55:53,738
just prior to the moment of impact.

2000
01:55:53,822 --> 01:55:56,032
However, according to
the data we retrieved

2001
01:55:56,116 --> 01:55:57,992
from the cockpit data recorders,

2002
01:55:58,243 --> 01:56:02,663
at exactly 9:34,
after flying 27 minutes without incident,

2003
01:56:02,748 --> 01:56:05,583
the transponder recorded
a loss in altitude

2004
01:56:05,667 --> 01:56:09,003
in excess of 4,800 feet per minute

2005
01:56:09,254 --> 01:56:12,757
in what is considered
a "full pitch nose down" attitude.

2006
01:56:13,091 --> 01:56:17,637
Then, at 9:42,
according to the data recorders,

2007
01:56:17,846 --> 01:56:20,931
a decision was made
to invert the aircraft.

of the cockpit recording

on board flight 227,

wherein you say, "We're going to roll it.

2035
01:57:20,826 --> 01:57:22,993
"Here we go. I've got control."

2036
01:57:23,245 --> 01:57:26,789
You made a very conscious decision
to invert the aircraft,

2037
01:57:26,873 --> 01:57:29,667
to roll the plane upside down,
is that correct?

2038
01:57:32,838 --> 01:57:35,673
I'm not sure if it was conscious. But...

2039
01:57:37,175 --> 01:57:39,176
It was more like instinct.

2040
01:57:40,345 --> 01:57:42,346
What led to that decision?

01:59:00,926 --> 01:59:03,594
This is the jackscrew
on the tail assembly

2061
01:59:03,678 --> 01:59:06,764
that articulates the horizontal stabilizer,

2062
01:59:06,932 --> 01:59:08,432
also known as the elevator.

2063
01:59:08,517 --> 01:59:09,725
As you can see,

2064
01:59:10,018 --> 01:59:13,145
the threads on this screw
are almost entirely gone.

2065
01:59:13,605 --> 01:59:16,857
This part was suggested as
a maintenance replacement

2066
01:59:17,192 --> 01:59:20,903
in January of 2011.
It was never replaced.

2067
01:59:21,446 --> 01:59:24,365
It had an additional
1 ,200 hours of flight on it.

2068
01:59:24,449 --> 01:59:25,616
It finally failed.

2069
01:59:25,742 --> 01:59:28,244
Our investigators have concluded

2070
01:59:28,703 --> 01:59:30,538
that the jackscrew snapped

2071
01:59:30,789 --> 01:59:34,458
and the elevator was frozen
in a fixed position,

2072
01:59:34,793 --> 01:59:37,336
locking the elevator in a down position,

2073
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:39,797
which forced the plane into a dive.

2074
01:59:40,131 --> 01:59:43,884
The loss of the elevator was,
and I quote our report,

2075
01:59:43,969 --> 01:59:47,471
"A catastrophic event
from which recovery was improbable

2076
01:59:47,556 --> 01:59:49,765
"and stable flight impossible."

2077
01:59:53,645 --> 01:59:54,979
Mr. Whitaker,

2078
01:59:55,814 --> 01:59:57,773
I want to talk about the days leading

2079
01:59:57,858 --> 02:00:00,484
and the hours leading
up to the accident.

2080
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:01,694
But before I do,

2081
02:00:01,778 --> 02:00:03,529
I want to remind you
that you are under oath

2082
02:00:03,613 --> 02:00:05,406
and that any testimony
you give here today

2083
02:00:05,490 --> 02:00:06,907
will be considered admissible

2084
02:00:07,033 --> 02:00:09,785
in any subsequent hearings
or criminal proceedings.

2085
02:00:09,995 --> 02:00:11,996
Do you understand what that means?

2086
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:17,543
Captain Whitaker, for the record,
I need you to verbalize your answer.

2087
02:00:18,795 --> 02:00:21,130
Uh, I'm sorry. Yes, I understand.

2088
02:00:21,590 --> 02:00:23,757
On the three days
leading up to the accident,

2089
02:00:23,842 --> 02:00:25,426
Tuesday, October 11th,

2090
02:00:25,510 --> 02:00:29,013
Wednesday, October 12th
or Thursday, October 13th,

2091
02:00:29,097 --> 02:00:33,183
did you consume any alcohol
or other intoxicating elements?

2092
02:00:34,144 --> 02:00:35,477
No, I did not.

2093
02:00:35,937 --> 02:00:37,646
ELLEN: On the morning of the accident,

2094
02:00:37,898 --> 02:00:39,940
Friday, October 14th,

2095
02:00:40,025 --> 02:00:45,195
did you consume any alcohol
or ingest any chemicals or drugs

2096
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:48,949
that may have impaired
your ability to perform yourjob?

2097
02:00:49,367 --> 02:00:51,035
No, I did not.

2098
02:00:51,912 --> 02:00:55,539
Mr. Whitaker, do you now
or have you ever had

2099
02:00:55,624 --> 02:00:57,833
a problem with alcohol dependency,

2100
02:00:57,918 --> 02:01:00,377
alcoholism or drug addiction?

2101
02:01:00,712 --> 02:01:01,712
No.

2102
02:01:04,049 --> 02:01:06,216
Okay, Mr. Whitaker, we're about done.

2103
02:01:13,308 --> 02:01:17,061
Due to the severe turbulence
in the early part of the flight,

2104
02:01:17,145 --> 02:01:19,480
you asked the flight crew to suspend

2105
02:01:19,564 --> 02:01:21,565
the beverage service
on the plane, is that correct?

2106
02:01:21,775 --> 02:01:22,775
Yes, that's correct.

2107
02:01:22,984 --> 02:01:25,486
I suspended
the drink service on the plane.

2108
02:01:25,570 --> 02:01:28,030
Are you aware that
our investigators found

2109
02:01:28,114 --> 02:01:31,700
two single service vodka bottles
in the galley trash bin?

2110
02:01:34,079 --> 02:01:35,412
Yes, I'm aware of that.

2111
02:01:36,748 --> 02:01:39,083
There were five crew members on board

2112
02:01:39,167 --> 02:01:41,752
that would have had access
to the beverage trolley.

2113
02:01:42,087 --> 02:01:44,004
Less than an hour after the accident,

2114
02:01:44,089 --> 02:01:46,048
blood was taken from each
of these crew members,

2115
02:01:46,132 --> 02:01:49,051
yourself, First Officer Evans,

2116
02:01:49,803 --> 02:01:52,137
Flight Attendant Margaret Thomason,

2117
02:01:52,764 --> 02:01:55,599
and posthumously from Camelia Satou

2118
02:01:56,267 --> 02:01:58,435
and Katerina Marquez.

2119
02:01:59,270 --> 02:02:02,606
Toxicology analysis was performed and

2120
02:02:03,108 --> 02:02:05,609
three of these tests came back negative,

2121
02:02:05,694 --> 02:02:08,612
one was disqualified
for technical reasons,

2122
02:02:08,697 --> 02:02:11,365
and one tested positive for alcohol.

2123
02:02:11,449 --> 02:02:14,451
It registered a .17 blood alcohol level.

2124
02:02:14,786 --> 02:02:16,453
Are you aware of that?

2125
02:02:17,122 --> 02:02:19,289
Yeah, I'm aware of it now.

2126
02:02:22,043 --> 02:02:23,252
Mmm-hmm.

2127
02:02:26,047 --> 02:02:28,716
Miss Marquez was not only a colleague,

2128
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:31,677
but you knew her outside of work,
is that correct?

2129
02:02:33,054 --> 02:02:34,722
Outside of work?

2130
02:02:35,557 --> 02:02:36,557
No, not really.

2131
02:02:37,058 --> 02:02:39,643
Did you know Miss Marquez
had a drinking problem?

2132
02:02:40,812 --> 02:02:41,895
No, I did not.

2133
02:02:42,313 --> 02:02:44,064
Did you ever see her drink to excess?

2134
02:02:47,068 --> 02:02:48,402
No, I did not.

2135
02:02:48,653 --> 02:02:51,655
ELLEN: Were you aware that she was
twice treated for alcohol addiction?

2136
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:55,993
The last time was 16 months ago
and paid for by SouthJet Airlines.

2137
02:02:57,078 --> 02:02:58,245
No, I did not.

2138
02:03:08,715 --> 02:03:10,382
Is it your opinion

2139
02:03:10,842 --> 02:03:12,801
that Katerina Marquez

2140
02:03:13,762 --> 02:03:15,596
drank on that flight?

2141
02:03:27,233 --> 02:03:29,068
Could you repeat the question?

2142
02:03:29,402 --> 02:03:34,573
Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez
drank on that flight?

2143
02:03:46,252 --> 02:03:47,419
I'm sorry, my what?

2144
02:03:47,504 --> 02:03:49,171
Your opinion, Captain.

2145
02:03:49,297 --> 02:03:52,257
Since her toxicology report
is the only toxicology report

2146
02:03:52,342 --> 02:03:54,426
that is admissible in this hearing,

2147
02:03:54,511 --> 02:03:57,179
and she in fact tested
positive for alcohol,

2148
02:03:57,263 --> 02:03:59,848
is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez

2149
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:03,936
drank those two bottles
of vodka on the plane?

2150
02:04:13,613 --> 02:04:15,280
(EXHALES) God help me.

2151
02:04:15,949 --> 02:04:17,032
ELLEN: I'm sorry, Mr. Whitaker,

2152
02:04:17,117 --> 02:04:19,284
I couldn't hear you. What did you say?

2153
02:04:21,788 --> 02:04:23,455
I said, "God help me."

2154
02:04:24,624 --> 02:04:27,543
Yes, well, however, is it your opinion...

2155
02:04:27,627 --> 02:04:28,794
It's my opinion

2156
02:04:29,379 --> 02:04:32,881
Trina did not drink that vodka.

2157
02:04:33,550 --> 02:04:34,800
Excuse me, Mr. Whitaker?

2158
02:04:34,884 --> 02:04:36,385
WHIP: She saved the boy's life, that's...

2159
02:04:36,553 --> 02:04:37,803
Could you speak louder,
Captain Whitaker?

2160
02:04:37,887 --> 02:04:40,639
Trina Marquez did not drink the vodka

2161
02:04:42,308 --> 02:04:44,309
because I drank the vodka.

2162
02:04:44,561 --> 02:04:45,561
(AUDIENCE MURMURING)

2163
02:04:45,979 --> 02:04:47,896
What the hell? Objection!

2164
02:04:49,566 --> 02:04:51,150
NTSB OFFICER: Please
be seated, sir. Sir.

2165
02:04:51,234 --> 02:04:52,734
CHARLIE: Captain Whitaker misspoke.

2166
02:04:53,403 --> 02:04:54,570
WHIP: I drank the vodka bottles.

2167
02:04:54,696 --> 02:04:55,821
CHARLIE: Didn't you hear me?
I said I object!

2168
02:04:56,072 --> 02:04:58,740
Please be seated, sir.
This is not a courtroom.

2169
02:04:58,867 --> 02:04:59,867
Well, I object anyway!

2170
02:05:01,661 --> 02:05:03,996
I drank the vodka bottles on the plane.

2171
02:05:05,748 --> 02:05:07,166
Captain Whitaker,

2172
02:05:07,250 --> 02:05:10,252
on the three nights
before the accident, October 11th...

2173
02:05:10,336 --> 02:05:12,421
October 11th, October 12th,

2174
02:05:12,505 --> 02:05:15,424
and 13th and 14th, I was intoxicated.

2175
02:05:15,508 --> 02:05:18,343
I drank all of those days. I drank.

2176
02:05:19,179 --> 02:05:20,512
In excess.

2177
02:05:21,931 --> 02:05:23,432
On the morning of the accident...

2178
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:24,933
I was drunk.

2179
02:05:32,859 --> 02:05:34,359
I'm drunk now.

2180
02:05:40,783 --> 02:05:44,286
I'm drunk right now, Miss Block.

2181
02:05:51,711 --> 02:05:53,712
Because I'm an alcoholic.

2182
02:06:19,239 --> 02:06:20,572
WHIP: That was it.

2183
02:06:24,410 --> 02:06:25,744
I was finished.

2184
02:06:27,747 --> 02:06:29,081
I was done.

2185
02:06:32,252 --> 02:06:36,421
It was as if I had reached
my lifelong limit

2186
02:06:37,090 --> 02:06:38,423
of lies.

2187
02:06:39,259 --> 02:06:41,927
I could not tell one more lie.

2188
02:06:45,598 --> 02:06:47,432
And maybe I'm a sucker,

2189
02:06:49,602 --> 02:06:52,104
'cause if I had told just one more lie,

2190
02:06:52,438 --> 02:06:55,274
I could have walked away
from all that mess

2191
02:06:55,608 --> 02:06:59,278
and kept my wings,
kept my false sense of pride.

2192
02:07:01,948 --> 02:07:03,532
And more importantly,

2193
02:07:03,658 --> 02:07:05,200
I could have avoided being locked up

2194
02:07:05,285 --> 02:07:06,702
in here with all you

2195
02:07:07,453 --> 02:07:10,289
nice folks for the last 13 months.

2196
02:07:14,002 --> 02:07:15,335
But I'm here.

2197
02:07:16,629 --> 02:07:20,716
And I'll be here
for at least the next four or five years.

2198
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:22,134
And that's fair.

2199
02:07:25,805 --> 02:07:28,473
I betrayed the public trust. I did.

2200
02:07:28,558 --> 02:07:30,225
That's how the judge explained it to me.

2201
02:07:30,310 --> 02:07:32,811
I had betrayed the public trust.

2202
02:07:34,814 --> 02:07:37,733
The FAA, they took away
my pilot's license.

2203
02:07:39,694 --> 02:07:41,236
And that's fair.

2204
02:07:42,071 --> 02:07:45,741
My chances
of ever flying again are slim to none.

2205
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:49,328
And I accept that.

2206
02:07:52,373 --> 02:07:55,208
I've had a lot of time
to think about it, all of it.

2207
02:07:57,045 --> 02:07:59,379
I've been doing some writing.

2208
02:08:01,215 --> 02:08:05,552
I wrote letters to each of the families
that had lost loved ones.

2209
02:08:08,389 --> 02:08:10,891
Some of them were able
to hear my apology.

2210
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:14,227
Some of them never will.

2211
02:08:15,897 --> 02:08:18,398
I also apologized to

2212
02:08:19,734 --> 02:08:24,404
all the people
that tried to help me along the way, but I

2213
02:08:25,698 --> 02:08:27,866
couldn't or wouldn't listen.

2214
02:08:31,746 --> 02:08:34,081
People like my wife, you know.

2215
02:08:37,418 --> 02:08:39,419
My ex-wife and, uh,

2216
02:08:43,424 --> 02:08:44,758
my son.

2217
02:08:48,262 --> 02:08:51,431
And again, like I said,
you know, some of them will

2218
02:08:53,768 --> 02:08:56,103
never forgive me. Some of them will.

2219
02:08:58,815 --> 02:09:00,649
But at least I'm sober.

2220
02:09:03,277 --> 02:09:06,446
I thank God for that. I'm grateful for that.

2221
02:09:09,492 --> 02:09:11,201
And this is going to sound real stupid

2222
02:09:11,327 --> 02:09:14,162
coming from a man
who's locked up in prison,

2223
02:09:16,290 --> 02:09:18,625
but for the first time in my life,

2224
02:09:19,794 --> 02:09:21,169
I'm free.

2225
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:37,477
Whitaker. You got a visitor.

2226
02:10:12,138 --> 02:10:13,138
(BUZZER SOUNDS)

2227
02:10:15,183 --> 02:10:17,225
- GUARD: You got 40 minutes.
- Okay.

2228
02:10:21,898 --> 02:10:22,898
(LAUGHS)

2229
02:10:23,774 --> 02:10:24,774
Aw.

2230
02:10:26,402 --> 02:10:27,402
Ah.

2231
02:10:28,196 --> 02:10:29,863
Look at you, boy.

2232
02:10:30,406 --> 02:10:32,449
- How are you doing?
- I'm good.

2233
