Dad, are you gonna have
chicken? You want meat?

42
00:02:05,185 --> 00:02:06,517
Chicken. Chicken's fine.

43
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,718
This is a brilliant article.

44
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,053
Norman! Did you read
Ken's article on China?

45
00:02:11,055 --> 00:02:13,021
No, no, I haven't read it.

46
00:02:13,023 --> 00:02:14,089
Terrific article.

47
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:17,192
He's in the house
watching the Yankee game.

48
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:20,828
Your husband. Comes up for a day
in the beautiful countryside

49
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,630
and heads straight
for the television set.

50
00:02:23,632 --> 00:02:24,997
Ken, come on, honey!

51
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:26,098
How many people want chicken,

52
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,100
and how many people want hamburgers?

53
00:02:28,102 --> 00:02:30,067
2 more outs! 3 minutes!

54
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:32,570
I think everybody's dying
for a little libation, huh?

55
00:02:32,572 --> 00:02:35,071
Why don't you make some of
your famous stoli Martinis?

56
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:38,274
Janet, so when are you and Ken
gonna have a child?

57
00:02:38,276 --> 00:02:41,076
You've let your sister
have a big head start here.

58
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:44,279
Let Leslie practice
the viola for 6 hours a day,

59
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:45,812
then it's not so easy.

60
00:02:45,814 --> 00:02:47,214
Leave her alone.

61
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:48,814
His fourth start with the mariners,

62
00:02:48,816 --> 00:02:52,018
trying to set 'em down
in order in the first

63
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,818
after his teammates got him 2.

64
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,986
Hi.

65
00:02:54,988 --> 00:02:59,589
I came in here to make
drinks for everybody.

66
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:00,657
Oh, yeah?

67
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:02,124
Yeah.

68
00:03:02,126 --> 00:03:05,193
What are you doing? You want a drink?

69
00:03:05,195 --> 00:03:07,262
Uh... Sure.

70
00:03:07,264 --> 00:03:08,562
Sure, I want...

71
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:11,698
The Yankees have
only 11 more home games

72
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,968
here at the stadium
the rest of the regular season.

73
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,303
This is nuts.

74
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:17,436
Yeah, come on.

75
00:03:17,438 --> 00:03:18,771
We got to get out of here.

76
00:03:18,773 --> 00:03:22,073
Yankees have
the second-best home record

77
00:03:22,075 --> 00:03:23,874
in the American league.

78
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:25,175
Breaking ball...

79
00:03:25,177 --> 00:03:27,711
Oh, God.

80
00:03:32,214 --> 00:03:34,748
What? No, no, no.
We're gonna get caught.

81
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,984
Mm-mmm. They're all by the lake.

82
00:03:36,986 --> 00:03:39,286
I can see everything.

83
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:48,392
Mmm.

84
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,860
Ohh.

85
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,429
Whoa.

86
00:03:53,398 --> 00:03:55,798
Oh, they're deep in conversation.

87
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,732
Wait! There's Janet!

88
00:03:57,734 --> 00:04:00,134
Ouch! Aah!

89
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:02,036
Whoa!

90
00:04:02,038 --> 00:04:02,670
Ken...

91
00:04:02,672 --> 00:04:04,571
No. Oh, no. No, it's ok.

92
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:08,007
You can't scare me like that,
ok? I grind my teeth.

93
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:10,375
Just don't scare me like that.

94
00:04:10,377 --> 00:04:11,743
It was nothing. Just a false alarm.

95
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:13,545
Listen, try not to actually chew.

96
00:04:13,547 --> 00:04:15,346
Oh, God, you know, wouldn't it be great

97
00:04:15,348 --> 00:04:17,880
if we could just be off alone together?

98
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,549
Just relaxed, you and me?

99
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,116
Oh, it would be so great.

100
00:04:21,118 --> 00:04:22,617
That would be so great.

101
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:25,387
You never know what's gonna happen.

102
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:30,724
Ken, turn the Yankee game off
and come on out here now!

103
00:04:30,726 --> 00:04:34,860
I will! Just one minute!
It's almost over!

104
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,702
I'm done. I'm done.

105
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:49,205
You can come anytime you want.

106
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:50,839
Can I?

107
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:52,073
I'm done.

108
00:04:52,075 --> 00:04:54,641
I'm ready! Ohh! Ohh!

109
00:04:54,643 --> 00:04:55,875
Leslie!

110
00:04:55,877 --> 00:04:57,844
Is that you?

111
00:04:57,846 --> 00:05:00,446
Can you lead me down
to the lake, honey?

112
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:02,547
Can you give me just a minute, grandma?

113
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:05,683
I'm just, um, I'm just
making some Martinis.

114
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:07,318
Sure. Sure, dear.

115
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,685
I want to finish.

116
00:05:08,687 --> 00:05:11,921
Oh. Ken. Is that you?

117
00:05:11,923 --> 00:05:13,089
Finish what?

118
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:15,958
Hello! Hello. Hiya.

119
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,258
Come, Ken.

120
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,126
Come?!

121
00:05:18,128 --> 00:05:20,127
Come, lead me down to the lake.

122
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:23,563
Ever since I lost my second eye,

123
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:25,064
I feel so frail.

124
00:05:25,066 --> 00:05:26,265
Ohh! Ohh!

125
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:27,767
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

126
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:29,934
You don't have to moan about it.

127
00:05:29,936 --> 00:05:31,769
It's not that terrible.

128
00:05:31,771 --> 00:05:33,570
Ken is hurrying, grandma.
He is hurrying.

129
00:05:33,572 --> 00:05:36,806
Would you do the olives, Ken?
Could you do them quickly?

130
00:05:36,808 --> 00:05:37,707
Yeah!

131
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:39,308
You can use onions, too.

132
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,777
I prefer onions. Don't you, Ken?

133
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:42,476
Yes!

134
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:45,012
Yes! Yes! Yes!

135
00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:47,282
Boy, you must really love onions.

136
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,886
How much do I...

137
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,790
Lucy?

138
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,358
You schmuck! You bastard!

139
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,993
I'd like to cut your fucking head off.

140
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:05,228
You're upset, right?

141
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,628
How could you do that?

142
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,495
Didn't you know what would happen?

143
00:06:08,497 --> 00:06:10,231
What are you talking about?

144
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:12,466
Don't... Answer me, prick.

145
00:06:12,468 --> 00:06:14,934
You knew. You just didn't give a shit.

146
00:06:14,936 --> 00:06:18,337
What? Why don't you take
your coat off for a second?

147
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:20,072
How could you write that book, huh?

148
00:06:20,074 --> 00:06:22,340
Are you so selfish?
You're so self-engrossed,

149
00:06:22,342 --> 00:06:24,642
you don't give a shit who you destroy?

150
00:06:24,644 --> 00:06:28,144
You told our whole story!

151
00:06:28,146 --> 00:06:29,111
All the details.

152
00:06:29,113 --> 00:06:31,146
You gave me away to my sister.

153
00:06:31,148 --> 00:06:33,715
Marvin's left me. He's gone.

154
00:06:33,717 --> 00:06:36,618
Hey, it was loosely based on us.

155
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,685
Don't bullshit me, motherfucker!

156
00:06:38,687 --> 00:06:40,953
Who do you think you're talking to,

157
00:06:40,955 --> 00:06:45,156
one of those retarded talk-show hosts?

158
00:06:45,158 --> 00:06:46,858
I lived through it with you, ok?

159
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,127
I know how loosely based it is,

160
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:54,197
that your blind grandmother
caught us fucking one day?

161
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:56,331
No, no, of course, of course.

162
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,567
You made a few stupid exaggerations,

163
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:00,602
or, you know, as the critics say,

164
00:07:00,604 --> 00:07:02,803
"inspired comic flights."

165
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:04,504
But Jane recognized it.

166
00:07:04,506 --> 00:07:06,872
Well, you'd have to be
submental not to.

167
00:07:06,874 --> 00:07:08,841
And Marvin was crushed, crushed!

168
00:07:08,843 --> 00:07:12,211
I can't tell you
how long ago she suspected...

169
00:07:12,213 --> 00:07:14,879
I know! I know! And I denied it!

170
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:15,846
And you've gone and...

171
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:19,048
You've gone and
confirmed it all for her.

172
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,816
I mean, big fucking deal...

173
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:22,685
you made Leslie shorter.

174
00:07:22,687 --> 00:07:24,419
Big fucking deal!

175
00:07:24,421 --> 00:07:25,887
But it's all here.

176
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:27,988
The poor schmuck country doctor,

177
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,290
the violinist...

178
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:31,090
Her younger sister in Connecticut

179
00:07:31,092 --> 00:07:33,092
cheating with her husband...

180
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:36,295
The picture window, for Christ's sake.

181
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:38,163
Cruel observations about Marvin

182
00:07:38,165 --> 00:07:40,898
with his barbecue and his chef's hat.

183
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,198
And, of course, Jane,

184
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,370
or, as you pathetically disguise her,

185
00:07:47,372 --> 00:07:49,438
Janet.

186
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,372
Here it is.

187
00:07:51,374 --> 00:07:54,241
<i>It was not simply that
Leslie had become numbed</i>

188
00:07:54,243 --> 00:07:56,677
<i>with the inane spate
of leaden perceptions</i>

189
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:58,945
<i>that passed for wit from Marvin.</i>

190
00:07:58,947 --> 00:08:02,148
<i>It was not even the image
she shared wickedly with Ken</i>

191
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,649
<i>of Marvin's flaccid,
microscopic member,</i>

192
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,952
<i>jiggling up and down
as he bounced naked on tiptoes</i>

193
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:10,154
<i>across the rugless, icy floor</i>

194
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,922
<i>of their Connecticut home
to close the storm windows.</i>

195
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:16,991
<i>It was that she had never loved him,</i>

196
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:18,993
<i>but wanted to have children</i>

197
00:08:18,995 --> 00:08:21,462
<i>to retaliate against her older sister,</i>

198
00:08:21,464 --> 00:08:23,863
<i>who did not have
a maternal bone in her being</i>

199
00:08:23,865 --> 00:08:25,465
<i>and whose every inch, Leslie felt,</i>

200
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:28,267
<i>was occupied by gluttonous self-love.</i>

201
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:31,369
<i>Ken ran his hand over
Leslie's large round breasts</i>

202
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:32,571
<i>and mounted her from the rear.</i>

203
00:08:32,572 --> 00:08:35,339
Oh, big fucking deal.
You gave her large breasts.

204
00:08:35,341 --> 00:08:36,973
Leslie, please...

205
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,774
Lucy!

206
00:08:38,776 --> 00:08:42,877
I'm Lucy, motherfucker!

207
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:45,947
Not Leslie.

208
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:48,915
Except, of course, I am Leslie,

209
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:52,184
because you made no attempt
to disguise anything.

210
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:53,218
You didn't give a fuck!

211
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,188
You didn't care enough
to disguise anything!

212
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,389
Please! Jesus!

213
00:08:57,391 --> 00:08:58,889
You pulled out 2 years ago.

214
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:01,191
You broke my fuckin' heart.

215
00:09:01,193 --> 00:09:03,926
You left your wife and me

216
00:09:03,928 --> 00:09:06,328
for some little cooze.

217
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,896
Me and Janet!

218
00:09:07,898 --> 00:09:11,866
Jane. Janet is the character
in the book.

219
00:09:11,868 --> 00:09:14,568
Now, 2 years on,

220
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,202
your latest Magnum opus

221
00:09:16,204 --> 00:09:20,272
emerges from this sewer
of an apartment,

222
00:09:20,274 --> 00:09:21,906
where you take everyone's suffering

223
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:25,209
and turn it into gold, literary gold.

224
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:27,944
Everyone's misery. You
even cause them misery.

225
00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:30,947
But mix your fucking alchemy
and make it into gold,

226
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:32,881
like some fucking black magician!

227
00:09:32,883 --> 00:09:34,216
Hey, give me a break.

228
00:09:34,218 --> 00:09:36,417
I'm the one who wound up in Bellevue.

229
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:38,285
You deserve it and worse.

230
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:39,018
Lucy!

231
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,986
You've ruined my life!

232
00:09:39,988 --> 00:09:42,154
I've come here to blow my brains out!

233
00:09:42,156 --> 00:09:43,256
What's wrong with you?

234
00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:45,724
In front of you on your carpet,

235
00:09:45,726 --> 00:09:46,692
because you caused it.

236
00:09:46,694 --> 00:09:47,725
My fucking brains on your carpet!

237
00:09:47,727 --> 00:09:50,061
You are so fucking unstable.
Will you relax?

238
00:09:50,063 --> 00:09:52,062
Well, that's why you
picked me, isn't it?

239
00:09:52,064 --> 00:09:54,364
That's what turns you on about me...

240
00:09:54,366 --> 00:09:55,565
Jane's crazy sister.

241
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:58,434
Calm down. You're not
gonna kill yourself.

242
00:09:58,436 --> 00:10:01,236
No, you're not,
because it's not in you.

243
00:10:01,238 --> 00:10:03,437
You're not the dramatic type.
You never were.

244
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:08,608
Jane is the dramatic sister.
Jane is the solo violinist.

245
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:13,911
Relax, for Christ's sake.

246
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,247
You're right.

247
00:10:17,214 --> 00:10:21,050
I don't have the nerve to kill myself.

248
00:10:21,986 --> 00:10:26,421
I knew it, you know,
as I came over here.

249
00:10:26,423 --> 00:10:28,588
I said, no...

250
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,825
Not me.

251
00:10:32,627 --> 00:10:34,660
Better...

252
00:10:34,662 --> 00:10:37,228
To kill him.

253
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,563
Pardon me?

254
00:10:38,565 --> 00:10:40,397
Kill the black magician

255
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,635
so he can't spin any more gold
out of human misery.

256
00:10:44,637 --> 00:10:46,702
Lucy, what's wrong with you?

257
00:10:46,704 --> 00:10:47,637
Shut up!

258
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:48,404
Put it down!

259
00:10:48,406 --> 00:10:52,106
Who else could have talked me
into giving him a blow job

260
00:10:52,108 --> 00:10:54,341
at my father's funeral?!

261
00:10:54,343 --> 00:10:56,477
Think it over.

262
00:10:59,014 --> 00:10:59,913
You stop right there!

263
00:10:59,915 --> 00:11:02,181
No, don't shoot!
Don't pull the trigger!

264
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:03,881
Look, if it makes you happy,

265
00:11:03,883 --> 00:11:05,617
my life has been going very badly.

266
00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:07,385
I've been miserable. My girl left me.

267
00:11:07,387 --> 00:11:09,586
She went off with
a close friend of mine.

268
00:11:09,588 --> 00:11:11,154
Everything's been... insomnia.

269
00:11:11,156 --> 00:11:13,155
I've squandered everything I have

270
00:11:13,157 --> 00:11:16,559
on shrinks and lawyers and whores.

271
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:20,328
I'm not gonna stand up here
on this fucking roof

272
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,430
w-with a world-class <i>meshugana</i> cunt

273
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,630
and beg for my life.

274
00:11:24,632 --> 00:11:26,132
If you want to shoot me, shoot me.

275
00:11:26,134 --> 00:11:27,732
I was working. You interrupted me.

276
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:29,968
So whose life
were you exploiting today?

277
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,803
You'll be very happy... rewriting them.

278
00:11:31,805 --> 00:11:34,305
I was working on a little
autobiographical thing

279
00:11:34,307 --> 00:11:35,939
about when I was first married.

280
00:11:37,742 --> 00:11:39,875
Harvey stern married too young...

281
00:11:39,877 --> 00:11:41,944
mainly to get out
of his parents' apartment,

282
00:11:41,946 --> 00:11:44,378
which was a rent-controlled cornucopia

283
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,646
of guilt, antagonism,

284
00:11:45,648 --> 00:11:47,547
and soul-deadening criticism.

285
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:51,217
By day, he labored listlessly
in a shoe store.

286
00:11:51,219 --> 00:11:55,221
He glowed intensely
over his Remington portable.

287
00:11:55,223 --> 00:11:57,522
Are you coming to bed?

288
00:11:57,524 --> 00:12:00,224
I'm in the middle of a sentence,

289
00:12:00,226 --> 00:12:01,657
and now I've lost my thread...

290
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:03,059
I'm just feeling a little rejected

291
00:12:03,061 --> 00:12:05,161
because we never
sleep together anymore.

292
00:12:05,363 --> 00:12:06,662
I don't know what it is.

293
00:12:06,664 --> 00:12:08,096
I'm just not attracted to her.

294
00:12:08,098 --> 00:12:09,531
Is she doing something to put you off?

295
00:12:09,608 --> 00:12:10,833
No, it's my fault, too.

296
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:14,634
And I lie to her. I tell her
that I'm too wrapped up in work,

297
00:12:14,736 --> 00:12:15,937
but the opposite is true.

298
00:12:16,138 --> 00:12:20,138
I'm hyper-sexually aroused,
just not for her.

299
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,206
Who for, then?

300
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,239
Anyone else.

301
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,375
She has a sister.
I'm dying to fuck her.

302
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:26,876
A doll. Thick lips.

303
00:12:26,878 --> 00:12:29,546
Her friend from Columbia.
Jennifer? I dream of her.

304
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,281
I never thought I could care
about African history,

305
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:33,482
but she's spellbinding.

306
00:12:33,484 --> 00:12:36,017
The truth is,
I never meet or see a woman

307
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:40,487
that I don't wonder what it
would be like in bed with her.

308
00:12:41,956 --> 00:12:43,656
Kid. Psst.

309
00:12:43,658 --> 00:12:46,157
I met a great hooker.

310
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,726
A hooker?

311
00:12:47,728 --> 00:12:50,394
Beautiful. From China.

312
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:52,296
Unbelievable body.

313
00:12:52,298 --> 00:12:56,933
Schooled by tradition
in the art of pleasing men.

314
00:12:56,935 --> 00:12:58,800
It's 50 clams.

315
00:12:58,802 --> 00:13:01,135
Wouldn't you be cheating on your wife?

316
00:13:01,137 --> 00:13:03,871
No. It's not cheating. She's a hooker.

317
00:13:03,873 --> 00:13:06,439
It's not like I'm having a love affair.

318
00:13:06,441 --> 00:13:09,174
See, you don't feel
for a professional girl

319
00:13:09,176 --> 00:13:10,943
the way you do for your wife.

320
00:13:10,945 --> 00:13:13,845
She comes over, rubs on her oils...

321
00:13:13,847 --> 00:13:14,912
oils?

322
00:13:14,914 --> 00:13:17,714
Into the sack,
she takes you to the moon.

323
00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:21,584
You lay half a c-note on her,
and she's history.

324
00:13:21,586 --> 00:13:22,986
I don't know. Where would you do it?

325
00:13:22,987 --> 00:13:26,354
I mean, I couldn't have her
come back to my apartment.

326
00:13:26,356 --> 00:13:27,388
You get a hotel room.

327
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,324
That's what I do when the wife's home.

328
00:13:30,326 --> 00:13:33,192
No. See, I don't have
that kind of dough.

329
00:13:33,194 --> 00:13:35,127
I mean, 50's a lot in itself, you know?

330
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:37,362
Maybe a friend will
let you use his place.

331
00:13:37,364 --> 00:13:41,132
Hey, kid, you're always
bitchin' about your sex life.

332
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:42,199
I'm trying to help.

333
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:46,069
And I just tell her that
you gave me the number?

334
00:13:46,071 --> 00:13:48,504
No, no, no, no. Not my name.

335
00:13:48,506 --> 00:13:50,205
Don't use your real name.

336
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,573
No, of cour... not the real name.

337
00:13:51,575 --> 00:13:54,242
Tell you what you do.
You borrow a friend's apartment.

338
00:13:54,244 --> 00:13:57,410
You use his name.
That way, it'll be on the bell.

339
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,246
Now good fortune smiled on Harvey

340
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:03,082
as one of his closest friends,

341
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:05,316
Mendel Birnbaum, was hit by a car

342
00:14:05,318 --> 00:14:07,918
and lay hovering between life and death

343
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,153
at New York hospital,

344
00:14:09,155 --> 00:14:11,888
thus freeing up
a great bachelor apartment

345
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,489
for Harvey's tryst.

346
00:14:13,491 --> 00:14:15,891
Donning the other man's silk robe...

347
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:18,393
Harvey became the swinger
Mendel Birnbaum

348
00:14:18,395 --> 00:14:23,363
and awaited his oriental
passport to paradise.

349
00:14:23,365 --> 00:14:26,533
You must be Mendel Birnbaum.

350
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:41,744
Aah!

351
00:14:46,882 --> 00:14:48,649
Did you enjoy it?

352
00:14:48,651 --> 00:14:51,184
Are you kidding me?
I will be right back.

353
00:14:51,186 --> 00:14:52,018
Where you going?

354
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,553
I'm gonna go check my pants

355
00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:55,854
and see if I can find another 50.

356
00:14:55,856 --> 00:14:56,954
I'd like to go again.

357
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:14,568
Mendel Birnbaum?

358
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,036
Yes?

359
00:15:16,038 --> 00:15:18,003
Open.

360
00:15:18,005 --> 00:15:20,371
Who is it?

361
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:24,943
Mendel Birnbaum?

362
00:15:24,945 --> 00:15:26,476
Who are you?

363
00:15:26,478 --> 00:15:28,878
I've come for you.

364
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,546
What are you talking about?

365
00:15:30,548 --> 00:15:31,980
I'm death,

366
00:15:31,982 --> 00:15:35,249
and your name is on my list.

367
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:38,586
No, no, no. Wait a minute.
You've made a mistake.

368
00:15:38,588 --> 00:15:40,954
You don't have a minute.

369
00:15:40,956 --> 00:15:42,455
No, see, I'm not Mendel birnb...

370
00:15:42,457 --> 00:15:45,524
don't give me that bullshit!

371
00:15:45,526 --> 00:15:47,259
Look at your monogram.

372
00:15:47,261 --> 00:15:50,261
Mendel, who are you talking to?

373
00:15:50,263 --> 00:15:51,929
No, stop calling me Mendel.

374
00:15:51,931 --> 00:15:53,830
Please, I'm just using his pad.

375
00:15:53,832 --> 00:15:56,699
Right. They always have an excuse.

376
00:15:56,701 --> 00:16:01,102
Let's go. Move it, you little putz.

377
00:16:01,104 --> 00:16:02,937
So I'm standing there
on the roof with her,

378
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:03,904
and she's pointing a gun at me,

379
00:16:03,906 --> 00:16:05,939
and we're out there in the cold,

380
00:16:05,941 --> 00:16:09,108
and I'm telling her
about a short story I wrote

381
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,941
when I was younger,

382
00:16:09,943 --> 00:16:11,410
and she found it funny, thank God,

383
00:16:11,412 --> 00:16:13,812
and she started to...
you know, she laughed,

384
00:16:13,814 --> 00:16:16,380
and she relaxed a little,
and she put the gun down,

385
00:16:16,382 --> 00:16:17,982
and, you know, but, uh...

386
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:20,183
so your writing saved your life.

387
00:16:20,185 --> 00:16:22,518
It's amazing to me, you know?

388
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,486
You know, the interesting thing to me,

389
00:16:24,488 --> 00:16:26,521
apart from the obvious sexual guilt

390
00:16:26,523 --> 00:16:30,190
that I had when I was
a young man in the story,

391
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:32,425
is that nothing's changed.

392
00:16:32,427 --> 00:16:34,059
You know, it's years later.

393
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:36,695
I had a shrink then,
I have a shrink now.

394
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:38,030
I'm 6 shrinks later.

395
00:16:38,032 --> 00:16:39,797
I'm 3 wives down the line,

396
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:43,100
and I still can't get
my love life in order.

397
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,768
I... I still love whores.

398
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,837
You know, I... I... I... I... I...

399
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,939
To me, the ideal thing is you pay them,

400
00:16:50,941 --> 00:16:52,340
and they come over to the house,

401
00:16:52,342 --> 00:16:55,542
and you don't have to discuss
Proust or films or...

402
00:16:55,544 --> 00:17:00,346
I don't know what's been
happening to me. You know, I...

403
00:17:00,348 --> 00:17:03,982
you know, you know,
I... I... I just have not grown up,

404
00:17:03,984 --> 00:17:06,717
and I feel, you know, it's not, um...

405
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:08,752
You know, I see other guys my age.

406
00:17:08,754 --> 00:17:11,554
I mean, I'm always thinking
of fucking every woman I meet.

407
00:17:11,556 --> 00:17:14,023
I meet a woman, wherever...
in the bank, a stranger.

408
00:17:14,025 --> 00:17:15,257
I see a woman on the bus.

409
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:17,392
I think, what would
she look like naked?

410
00:17:17,394 --> 00:17:19,559
Is it possible I can fuck her?

411
00:17:19,561 --> 00:17:20,794
You know, this is crazy.

412
00:17:20,796 --> 00:17:24,398
I see guys I know that
are lawyers and doctors.

413
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,332
They have families and houses.

414
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:27,533
They're... they're not so, you know...

415
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:30,035
does the president of the United States

416
00:17:30,037 --> 00:17:32,069
want to fuck every woman he...

417
00:17:32,071 --> 00:17:34,538
so... Bad example, you know.

418
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,073
But... but, uh, I... I don't know.

419
00:17:37,075 --> 00:17:38,675
Look, take Raoul Wallenberg.

420
00:17:38,677 --> 00:17:42,110
Did he want to bang every
cocktail waitress in Europe?

421
00:17:42,112 --> 00:17:43,477
Probably not, but...

422
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,813
Tell me about your
honoring ceremony tomorrow.

423
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,049
Oh, that's... that's, uh,
that's bullshit.

424
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:50,250
It's ironic that the same school

425
00:17:50,252 --> 00:17:52,418
that threw me out years ago

426
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,019
now wants to honor me.

427
00:17:54,021 --> 00:17:58,957
They threw me out because
I was not interested in college.

428
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:00,325
I wanted to be a writer.

429
00:18:00,327 --> 00:18:02,025
That's all I cared about was writing.

430
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:04,226
I did not care about the real world.

431
00:18:04,228 --> 00:18:06,995
I cared only about
the world of fiction.

432
00:18:06,997 --> 00:18:10,565
Plus, I tried to give
the Dean's wife an enema,

433
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:12,599
so they didn't take kindly to that.

434
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:15,268
But, you know, the sad thing is,

435
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,470
I gotta drive all the way upstate

436
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:20,806
to be honored,
and I have to go by myself.

437
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,107
I got nobody to go with.

438
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:24,375
You know, I... I...
you know... ok, so...

439
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:27,210
and... and... I... I...
you know, I can't...

440
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:29,678
what about your idea of
bringing your son up with you?

441
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,048
It's not my visiting time with him.

442
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,116
Joan is completely inflexible, so...

443
00:18:34,118 --> 00:18:36,617
You mean she won't
trade dates with you?

444
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:38,852
Hey, I can't even get her on the phone.

445
00:18:38,854 --> 00:18:41,754
You know, she hates me, and...

446
00:18:41,756 --> 00:18:43,055
I don't know. Lately...

447
00:18:43,057 --> 00:18:45,024
for the first time in my life,

448
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:46,492
I experienced writer's block.

449
00:18:46,494 --> 00:18:48,426
Now, this to me is unheard of.

450
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:52,262
I start these short stories,
and I can't finish them.

451
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:55,765
I can't get into my novel at all,

452
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,468
because I took an advance.

453
00:18:59,268 --> 00:19:00,836
I don't know. I...

454
00:19:00,838 --> 00:19:05,505
I find that I'm taking more
pills and medicine and...

455
00:19:05,507 --> 00:19:07,040
You remind me of that short story

456
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:10,609
you were working on
maybe 2 months ago...

457
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:11,910
<i>the actor.</i>

458
00:19:11,912 --> 00:19:14,645
This goddamn lens has
something wrong with it.

459
00:19:14,647 --> 00:19:16,147
What, this one, too? I changed lenses.

460
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:18,281
What are you talking about?
The focus is off.

461
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,183
I don't know why there
should be such a problem.

462
00:19:20,185 --> 00:19:21,985
You check the center.
It's out of focus.

463
00:19:21,987 --> 00:19:23,686
I've checked all the lenses.
They can't all be soft.

464
00:19:23,688 --> 00:19:25,253
Come on, guys. Let's move it along.

465
00:19:25,255 --> 00:19:26,821
It's getting late here.
We got to move it.

466
00:19:26,823 --> 00:19:29,656
I'm trying to shoot Mel
on the bench, and he's soft.

467
00:19:29,658 --> 00:19:32,159
Where the hell are you
renting these lenses?

468
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:33,427
The lenses are fine.

469
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:34,994
Holy shit, Mel's out of focus.

470
00:19:34,996 --> 00:19:37,062
That's what I said, genius.
He's out of focus.

471
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:39,597
No, I don't mean the lens.
I mean Mel himself.

472
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:41,098
Let me see. Get the hell out.

473
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,666
I don't believe it. You're right.

474
00:19:42,668 --> 00:19:45,502
What the hell are you talking about?

475
00:19:45,504 --> 00:19:48,038
I said the actor's out of focus.

476
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,071
How can this be?

477
00:19:49,073 --> 00:19:50,839
Is there something wrong?

478
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:55,510
I don't know how
to tell you this, but, um...

479
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:56,444
You're soft.

480
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,245
I've gained a little weight.

481
00:19:58,247 --> 00:19:59,780
No, it's not that. You're soft.

482
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,748
You're... you're...
You're out of focus.

483
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,283
Is there anything we can do about this?

484
00:20:05,285 --> 00:20:07,585
I can't adjust this kind of thing.

485
00:20:07,587 --> 00:20:09,486
Look at yourself.

486
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:11,555
There's nothing to do.

487
00:20:11,557 --> 00:20:13,289
You sure you're ok?

488
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,324
It's... it's fuzzy. It's kind of...

489
00:20:16,326 --> 00:20:17,259
I feel fine.

490
00:20:17,261 --> 00:20:19,061
Mel's out of focus.

491
00:20:19,063 --> 00:20:20,195
He's soft.

492
00:20:20,197 --> 00:20:21,996
I don't know what to do.

493
00:20:21,998 --> 00:20:23,863
It's almost 4:00 already anyway.

494
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:25,198
Why don't we just wrap?

495
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,666
We'll wrap, and we'll see what happens.

496
00:20:27,668 --> 00:20:30,235
Mel, look, I want you to go home,

497
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:32,336
and I want you to rest. Get some rest.

498
00:20:32,338 --> 00:20:35,639
And, uh, see if you
can just sharpen up.

499
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,645
Grace, I'm home.

500
00:20:42,647 --> 00:20:43,878
Hi, honey.

501
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,880
Hey. What's the matter?

502
00:20:46,882 --> 00:20:48,916
You look strange.

503
00:20:48,918 --> 00:20:50,216
I'm out of focus.

504
00:20:50,218 --> 00:20:53,519
Yeah. Yeah, you are. Just a little bit.

505
00:20:53,521 --> 00:20:55,921
You are, and you look pale.

506
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:57,722
Daddy, you're all blurry.

507
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:59,957
Yeah, maybe you should go lie down.

508
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,392
<i>♪ Daddy's out of focus ♪</i>

509
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,293
Daddy doesn't need that, ok?

510
00:21:04,295 --> 00:21:06,129
Come on, now, you be nice.

511
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,263
What happened at work today?

512
00:21:08,265 --> 00:21:10,498
<i>♪ Daddy's out of focus ♪</i>

513
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,332
Rueben! Stop it!

514
00:21:11,334 --> 00:21:12,899
They thought it was the camera,

515
00:21:12,901 --> 00:21:15,168
then they... then... it was me.

516
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,337
Yeah. They sent me home.
It's so humiliating.

517
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:19,905
Did you eat anything strange at lunch?

518
00:21:19,907 --> 00:21:23,908
I don't know what it is,
you know. You know what?

519
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,410
I just need to lie down,
get a good night's sleep.

520
00:21:26,412 --> 00:21:27,610
I'll be ok, you know?

521
00:21:27,612 --> 00:21:28,879
I'm sure that's all it is.

522
00:21:28,881 --> 00:21:29,881
Dad, what happened to you?

523
00:21:29,882 --> 00:21:32,316
You get a good night's
sleep, turn in early,

524
00:21:32,318 --> 00:21:34,618
and by tomorrow, you'll be fine.

525
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,887
The following morning, however,

526
00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:38,155
things did not improve.

527
00:21:38,157 --> 00:21:40,658
In fact, the situation
had gotten worse.

528
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,528
Mel was more out of focus than ever.

529
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,697
I gotta get to the doctor.

530
00:21:45,699 --> 00:21:49,233
I've never seen anything like this.

531
00:21:49,235 --> 00:21:50,868
Nothing is wrong with you,

532
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,037
except you're out of focus.

533
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,975
It's just from looking at Mel.
I'm a little seasick.

534
00:21:56,977 --> 00:22:00,745
That's why I want
everyone to try these.

535
00:22:00,747 --> 00:22:01,679
Here, dear.

536
00:22:01,681 --> 00:22:03,782
I don't want to wear glasses, mom.

537
00:22:03,784 --> 00:22:05,618
I don't want to wear glasses.

538
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,287
Put 'em on so you can see me, son.

539
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:09,588
This is much better.

540
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,223
You'll be able to see me. Put it on.

541
00:22:11,225 --> 00:22:13,025
Put those on. Daddy'll be much sharper.

542
00:22:13,027 --> 00:22:15,060
Don't you want to see
daddy? There you go.

543
00:22:15,062 --> 00:22:17,664
Put those on,
and we won't get headaches.

544
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,232
So, despite the fact

545
00:22:19,234 --> 00:22:22,035
that children don't
want to wear glasses,

546
00:22:22,037 --> 00:22:24,104
they're forced to.

547
00:22:24,305 --> 00:22:26,438
You expect the world to adjust

548
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,708
to the distortion you've become.

549
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,110
Hey, I don't expect anything.

550
00:22:30,112 --> 00:22:33,413
I'm going through something...
I don't know what.

551
00:22:33,415 --> 00:22:36,116
I know for the first time in my life,

552
00:22:36,118 --> 00:22:37,817
I can't seem to write.

553
00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:38,919
It's not coming.

554
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:40,755
And for me, you know,

555
00:22:40,757 --> 00:22:43,558
all I have in life is my imagination.

556
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,359
I'm sorry. Our time is up.

557
00:22:45,361 --> 00:22:47,562
Have a good time at
the honoring ceremony tomorrow,

558
00:22:47,564 --> 00:22:50,431
and I do think it would be good
for both you and your son

559
00:22:50,433 --> 00:22:53,335
if you brought him along.

560
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:57,005
Joan! Joan! Joan, you never
return my phone calls.

561
00:22:57,007 --> 00:22:59,241
How do you expect me
to get in touch with you?

562
00:22:59,243 --> 00:23:00,943
Do you want me to call the police?

563
00:23:00,945 --> 00:23:02,612
I've got to ask you one question.

564
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,279
No. I don't want to listen to you.

565
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:07,616
Tomorrow they're honoring me
at Adair, my old university.

566
00:23:07,618 --> 00:23:09,084
I want to take Hilly with me.

567
00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:12,254
I want to trade
one visitation day with him.

568
00:23:12,256 --> 00:23:13,322
No. I have plans with Hilly.

569
00:23:13,324 --> 00:23:14,557
We'll trade one day.
It'll be good to see.

570
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,559
The kid will see his father
honored. It's nice.

571
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,195
I don't want him to see you
the rest of your life.

572
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,964
He'll have a day in the country.

573
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:25,068
The kid'll have a day in
the country. What is so bad?

574
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,337
He is 9 years old.

575
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:27,705
Where does he learn phrases

576
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:29,840
like "banging beaver" and "fuck God"?

577
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:31,175
What are you saying? From me?

578
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:32,910
What do I look like, an imbecile?

579
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,545
I know what your conversations

580
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:35,346
are like with him,

581
00:23:35,348 --> 00:23:36,714
and don't think I didn't hear

582
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:37,816
about "open school week."

583
00:23:37,818 --> 00:23:39,718
Beth Kramer has never been so appalled

584
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,421
Dad, why doesn't my penis
look like yours?

585
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,624
Why doesn't your penis look like mine?

586
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:51,129
Because your mother and I
never had you circumcised.

587
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:53,131
When I was your age,
every kid in my neighborhood...

588
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:56,968
you know what they used to do?
They used to name their penises.

589
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,470
I'm going to name mine Dillinger.

590
00:23:58,472 --> 00:24:02,008
Dillinger is perfect!
Dillinger is great!

591
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,776
Hilly, you're inspired.
You're a genius.

592
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:05,945
Dillinger was one of the great geniuses

593
00:24:05,947 --> 00:24:07,380
of his chosen profession.

594
00:24:07,382 --> 00:24:08,881
You know, like Willy Sutton.

595
00:24:08,883 --> 00:24:11,017
Remember when we discussed Freud once?

596
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:13,987
Freud said that the two
most important things

597
00:24:13,989 --> 00:24:15,856
to having a good life are...

598
00:24:15,858 --> 00:24:18,258
The work that you choose and sex.

599
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,826
Those are the 2 things.

600
00:24:19,828 --> 00:24:22,028
Women are God.

601
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:22,962
God's a woman?

602
00:24:22,964 --> 00:24:25,165
No. I'm not saying God's a woman.

603
00:24:25,167 --> 00:24:27,100
Let me put it this way...
there are women.

604
00:24:27,102 --> 00:24:28,635
We don't know if there's a God,

605
00:24:28,637 --> 00:24:29,637
but there are women,

606
00:24:29,638 --> 00:24:31,872
you know, not in some imaginary heaven,

607
00:24:31,874 --> 00:24:33,273
but right here on earth,

608
00:24:33,275 --> 00:24:38,012
some of them, ahem, shop
at Victoria's secret.

609
00:24:38,014 --> 00:24:41,049
Beth Kramer has never been so mortified

610
00:24:41,051 --> 00:24:45,086
Beth Kramer's an aggressive,
tight-assed, busybody cunt,

611
00:24:45,088 --> 00:24:48,323
and it's none of her fucking
business how I speak to my son.

612
00:24:48,325 --> 00:24:51,560
Beth Kramer is a decent
parent and a great friend.

613
00:24:51,562 --> 00:24:54,897
Look, I'm asking you
to change one visitation day.

614
00:24:54,899 --> 00:24:58,966
I don't know. He is not
gonna miss a day of school.

615
00:24:58,968 --> 00:25:00,235
What if he was sick?

616
00:25:00,237 --> 00:25:03,005
If Hilly was sick,
he would miss school.

617
00:25:03,007 --> 00:25:04,340
But he is not sick,

618
00:25:04,342 --> 00:25:06,775
and he's not gonna spend the afternoon

619
00:25:06,777 --> 00:25:09,278
with his pill-popping, alcoholic,

620
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,513
beaver-banging excuse for a father.

621
00:25:11,515 --> 00:25:14,384
Years ago, you didn't
say that about me.

622
00:25:14,386 --> 00:25:17,620
You were a nice, loose,
easygoing spirit.

623
00:25:17,622 --> 00:25:18,755
Put it in a book.

624
00:25:18,757 --> 00:25:21,825
What am I saying? You already did.

625
00:25:21,827 --> 00:25:24,729
Epstein had married his third shrink.

626
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,765
He had confessed his feelings
toward her several times,

627
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:30,801
and it seemed she had put it
down to transference,

628
00:25:30,803 --> 00:25:33,671
but one day, she surprised him.

629
00:25:33,673 --> 00:25:35,172
I think it best...

630
00:25:35,174 --> 00:25:38,676
That we terminate your treatment.

631
00:25:38,678 --> 00:25:40,544
And then I think we should

632
00:25:40,546 --> 00:25:44,248
give it a substantial period of time,

633
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,517
and then if we both feel the same way,

634
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:50,489
I think we can begin to
see each other again...

635
00:25:50,491 --> 00:25:52,624
Socially.

636
00:25:52,825 --> 00:25:55,761
It was, to Epstein's thinking,

637
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:57,129
a match made in heaven.

638
00:25:57,131 --> 00:26:01,200
Here, at last, was a woman
who understood him.

639
00:26:01,202 --> 00:26:02,935
You know all my secrets,

640
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:05,171
every nuance of my psychic life,

641
00:26:05,173 --> 00:26:08,174
that I haven't admitted
to you during therapy.

642
00:26:08,176 --> 00:26:10,476
Well, now it's your turn to explore me.

643
00:26:10,478 --> 00:26:12,980
Yeah, but all my perversions,
you accept them.

644
00:26:12,982 --> 00:26:16,249
My need to be tied up,
to watch you with other women,

645
00:26:16,251 --> 00:26:18,851
to feel your spike heels in my mouth.

646
00:26:18,853 --> 00:26:21,120
No one can say that I didn't know

647
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:24,491
what I was letting myself in for.

648
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:27,461
The first 2 years were amazing.

649
00:26:27,463 --> 00:26:29,596
They moved into a large apartment

650
00:26:29,598 --> 00:26:30,664
on west end Avenue.

651
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:32,633
He wrote. She saw patients.

652
00:26:32,635 --> 00:26:36,304
But her clearest insights
were into his work.

653
00:26:36,306 --> 00:26:37,705
Well, what one comes away with

654
00:26:37,707 --> 00:26:40,842
is your total isolation,
your fear of people,

655
00:26:40,844 --> 00:26:42,677
your panic over closeness,

656
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:46,148
and that's why your
real life is so chaotic

657
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:49,518
is so much more controlled and stable.

658
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,053
I mean, you're unable to...

659
00:26:51,055 --> 00:26:52,921
Yes, it all went quite well

660
00:26:52,923 --> 00:26:56,057
until Helen became pregnant
and gave birth.

661
00:26:56,059 --> 00:26:57,158
From that moment on,

662
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,029
as if she had experienced
a divine revelation,

663
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:03,933
she suddenly became what
Epstein referred to angrily

664
00:27:03,935 --> 00:27:05,935
as "Jewish with a vengeance."

665
00:27:05,937 --> 00:27:08,170
I just rue the day
that I listened to you,

666
00:27:08,172 --> 00:27:11,174
and I didn't have him circumcised.

667
00:27:11,176 --> 00:27:12,409
What are you, nuts?

668
00:27:12,411 --> 00:27:14,377
Well, you know, we can still do it.

669
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:16,079
No. No, he's too old.

670
00:27:16,081 --> 00:27:17,647
What is wrong with you?

671
00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:19,416
Oh, sure. Now he's too old.

672
00:27:19,418 --> 00:27:21,886
My God, you're like
a born-again Christian,

673
00:27:21,888 --> 00:27:23,054
except you're a Jew.

674
00:27:23,056 --> 00:27:25,990
I see my father's face in Hillel.

675
00:27:25,992 --> 00:27:29,527
Hilliard. His name is Hilliard.

676
00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:30,795
We didn't name him Hillel.

677
00:27:30,797 --> 00:27:33,464
We didn't name him after some rabbi.

678
00:27:33,466 --> 00:27:34,466
It's Hilliard Epstein.

679
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:36,601
No, I'm sick of your smug cynicism.

680
00:27:36,603 --> 00:27:37,935
There's value in tradition.

681
00:27:37,937 --> 00:27:39,804
Now, I never thought
it would mean anything,

682
00:27:39,806 --> 00:27:41,572
but now that I'm a mother, it does.

683
00:27:41,574 --> 00:27:45,811
I see not only meaning
in Judaism, but true beauty.

684
00:27:45,813 --> 00:27:47,779
Helen, you're a scientist.

685
00:27:47,781 --> 00:27:49,047
Einstein was a scientist,

686
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:51,483
and he was a Jew, and he was religious.

687
00:27:51,485 --> 00:27:56,455
Helen had taken on
the obligation of daily prayers,

688
00:27:56,457 --> 00:27:59,926
fearing a wrathful and vengeful God,

689
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:03,329
give praise and thanks for everything.

690
00:28:17,945 --> 00:28:21,348
...Blow job.

691
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:24,552
And one day, the inevitable happened.

692
00:28:24,554 --> 00:28:26,453
A patient of Helen's, an Israeli,

693
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,889
who had come to her
in a depressed state

694
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:31,225
over his wife having left him,

695
00:28:31,227 --> 00:28:33,094
captured Helen's heart.

696
00:28:33,096 --> 00:28:35,230
I think we should
terminate your treatment

697
00:28:35,232 --> 00:28:38,433
and give it a substantial
period of time,

698
00:28:38,435 --> 00:28:40,268
and then if we both
still feel the same way,

699
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:46,709
then I think we could start
to see each other socially.

700
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,611
Harry?

701
00:28:49,613 --> 00:28:51,212
Harry?

702
00:28:51,714 --> 00:28:52,814
Harry?

703
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:53,515
Richard.

704
00:28:53,517 --> 00:28:54,883
Lost in thought, I think.

705
00:28:54,885 --> 00:28:58,554
I was just thinking
about a book that I wrote.

706
00:28:58,556 --> 00:28:59,889
Well, I'm a mess.

707
00:28:59,891 --> 00:29:00,623
What's the matter?

708
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:02,224
I'm on my way to the doctor's.

709
00:29:02,226 --> 00:29:04,527
I'm having severe pains in my chest.

710
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:06,596
That's nothing. That's indigestion

711
00:29:06,598 --> 00:29:08,865
or gallbladder or ulcer or acid reflux.

712
00:29:08,867 --> 00:29:10,334
No. Except I've got a family history.

713
00:29:10,336 --> 00:29:12,135
My father died prematurely
of a heart attack,

714
00:29:12,137 --> 00:29:14,404
my mother dropped dead
of a massive coronary,

715
00:29:14,406 --> 00:29:16,173
and both my brother's were dead

716
00:29:16,175 --> 00:29:18,408
before they were 50 from heart failure.

717
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,812
I don't know why you're
wasting time talking to me.

718
00:29:20,814 --> 00:29:22,680
You should get an ambulance.

719
00:29:22,682 --> 00:29:23,414
Are you busy?

720
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:24,782
I was gonna see my editor.

721
00:29:24,784 --> 00:29:27,117
It's just that I hate going
for these tests alone.

722
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,755
My mother died, you know,
giving birth to me...

723
00:29:30,757 --> 00:29:33,157
for which my father
never forgave me, you know.

724
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:37,261
It's funny. I wish before
he died I had forgiven him.

725
00:29:37,263 --> 00:29:39,897
But we're morbid,
'cause you think you're dying,

726
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:41,065
you know, but you're not.

727
00:29:41,067 --> 00:29:43,836
Today, they got lasers.
They got all kinds of...

728
00:29:43,838 --> 00:29:45,671
yeah, you and science, right?

729
00:29:45,673 --> 00:29:47,873
Well, yes. There's
nothing wrong with science.

730
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:50,209
Between air conditioning and the pope,

731
00:29:50,211 --> 00:29:51,610
I'll take air conditioning.

732
00:29:51,612 --> 00:29:53,045
I'm scared. I'm really scared.

733
00:29:53,047 --> 00:29:56,416
Can we change the subject?
Can I change the subject?

734
00:29:56,418 --> 00:29:58,752
You know, I have writer's block.

735
00:29:58,754 --> 00:30:00,887
For the first time in my life,

736
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:03,389
I can't come up with a meaningful idea,

737
00:30:03,391 --> 00:30:04,757
something that holds my interest.

738
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:06,025
Well, I think since fay left you,

739
00:30:06,027 --> 00:30:07,394
you've been having a lot of trouble.

740
00:30:07,396 --> 00:30:10,230
I'm seeing fay later.
I'm having a drink with fay.

741
00:30:10,232 --> 00:30:11,331
I think that's very good.

742
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:13,566
I think she's good for you.

743
00:30:13,568 --> 00:30:15,101
She's a lot better than, um,

744
00:30:15,103 --> 00:30:18,506
a lot of those other
crazies that, uh, you...

745
00:30:18,508 --> 00:30:19,840
ow! My God, my arm. Oh!

746
00:30:19,842 --> 00:30:22,910
I'm telling you, it's nothing, nothing.

747
00:30:22,912 --> 00:30:24,211
Oh!

748
00:30:24,213 --> 00:30:25,980
I'm not scared.

749
00:30:25,982 --> 00:30:28,315
You're in great shape, great shape.

750
00:30:28,317 --> 00:30:31,420
You have a little
bursitis in your arm...

751
00:30:31,422 --> 00:30:32,654
Well, that's fantastic.

752
00:30:32,656 --> 00:30:34,489
You see? What do I always say?

753
00:30:34,491 --> 00:30:36,358
The most beautiful words
in the English language

754
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,794
are not "I love you,"
but "it's benign."

755
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:40,796
Look, we could do some more tests,

756
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:42,364
but I don't think so.

757
00:30:42,366 --> 00:30:43,131
This is fantastic.

758
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:44,332
Your heart's in great shape.

759
00:30:44,334 --> 00:30:47,569
While I'm here, I hurt
my back a few weeks ago

760
00:30:47,571 --> 00:30:48,937
opening a subzero refrigerator.

761
00:30:48,939 --> 00:30:51,173
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

762
00:30:51,175 --> 00:30:52,240
Let me schedule you.

763
00:30:52,242 --> 00:30:53,075
I don't have time.

764
00:30:53,077 --> 00:30:54,877
What are you doing tomorrow?

765
00:30:54,879 --> 00:30:56,179
Well, I'm busy. Why?

766
00:30:56,181 --> 00:30:58,281
Because I'm going up
to my old university.

767
00:30:58,283 --> 00:30:59,182
They're honoring me.

768
00:30:59,184 --> 00:31:01,117
I'm looking for company
to come with me.

769
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:04,153
I'm sure... I don't think
I can get out of this thing,

770
00:31:04,155 --> 00:31:09,193
but... but that's great.
You know, congratulations.

771
00:31:25,376 --> 00:31:26,710
So, you look great.

772
00:31:26,712 --> 00:31:28,947
Ah, thank you. You look a little tired.

773
00:31:28,949 --> 00:31:32,951
Yes. 'Cause I'm struggling
with this book, you know, uh...

774
00:31:32,953 --> 00:31:36,020
Naturally, I spent the advance already.

775
00:31:36,022 --> 00:31:38,656
I'm having a tough, uh... A tough time.

776
00:31:38,658 --> 00:31:42,461
The reason that I wanted
to have this drink was...

777
00:31:42,463 --> 00:31:43,996
can I get a red wine,

778
00:31:43,998 --> 00:31:46,232
exact same thing that she has, please?

779
00:31:46,234 --> 00:31:49,335
I wanted to be the first
to tell you that, um...

780
00:31:49,337 --> 00:31:51,070
I'm getting married.

781
00:31:51,072 --> 00:31:53,273
Oh. Don't say that.

782
00:31:53,275 --> 00:31:54,107
Why?

783
00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:55,776
What do you mean, why?

784
00:31:55,778 --> 00:31:58,477
Because... I love you.

785
00:31:58,479 --> 00:32:01,447
How can you get married?

786
00:32:01,449 --> 00:32:02,815
Who? Is it Larry?

787
00:32:02,817 --> 00:32:06,520
I knew that. I don't
fucking believe this.

788
00:32:06,522 --> 00:32:09,523
You know, this guy's
allegedly a friend of mine.

789
00:32:09,525 --> 00:32:11,491
It's, you know, it's the devil.

790
00:32:11,493 --> 00:32:13,126
I should never have introduced you.

791
00:32:13,128 --> 00:32:16,297
When Larry's around,
I smell burning sulfur.

792
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,300
Can we have your blessing?

793
00:32:19,302 --> 00:32:20,601
Can I have it?

794
00:32:20,603 --> 00:32:22,804
No! You certainly
don't have my blessing.

795
00:32:22,806 --> 00:32:25,439
I don't want you to get married.

796
00:32:25,441 --> 00:32:27,442
I don't want you to.

797
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:28,444
I should go.

798
00:32:28,445 --> 00:32:29,378
I was your pupil.

799
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,847
It was Henry Higgins
and Eliza Doolittle.

800
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:34,883
That's what it was,
and that's what you loved.

801
00:32:34,885 --> 00:32:36,651
But it didn't work that way.

802
00:32:36,653 --> 00:32:37,985
What do you want me to say?

803
00:32:37,987 --> 00:32:39,788
Why did you fall in love with me?

804
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,957
I mean, you gave me
those endless lectures

805
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:44,459
on love in the Western world.

806
00:32:44,461 --> 00:32:47,996
I didn't think I could.
I thought I was too damaged.

807
00:32:47,998 --> 00:32:50,432
You know, but it's not, you know...

808
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:51,501
I woke up one morning,

809
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:53,403
and I looked at you over breakfast,

810
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:58,274
and I thought to myself,
"God, this is what they mean.

811
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,944
This is what they're
talking about." And I...

812
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:03,214
all those warnings about
how I wasn't supposed

813
00:33:03,216 --> 00:33:04,548
to fall in love with you.

814
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,917
I know, but then I fell
in love with you.

815
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:08,586
Another jerk fan.

816
00:33:08,588 --> 00:33:12,156
That I would fuck you
and move on to the next fan,

817
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:13,923
but it didn't happen that way.

818
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:18,562
You know, you were a fan
and a... a... a follower

819
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:19,864
and then a pupil

820
00:33:19,866 --> 00:33:22,099
and then... then you were a roommate.

821
00:33:22,101 --> 00:33:24,435
And, you know, before I knew it,

822
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:28,440
you were the one who had control
of the channel changer.

823
00:33:28,442 --> 00:33:29,808
Hey, look...

824
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:32,077
You know, I'm... I'm...

825
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:34,412
Harry...

826
00:33:34,414 --> 00:33:36,014
I loved you.

827
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:37,850
I was in awe of you.

828
00:33:37,852 --> 00:33:41,621
But I wasn't in love with you.

829
00:33:41,623 --> 00:33:43,155
To my old university.

830
00:33:43,157 --> 00:33:45,458
They're honoring me,
if you can believe that.

831
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,394
Come with me. Give me a chance
to talk you out of it.

832
00:33:48,396 --> 00:33:49,763
Spend one day with me.

833
00:33:49,765 --> 00:33:52,265
Harry, I'm getting married tomorrow.

834
00:33:52,267 --> 00:33:54,634
Tomorrow you're getting married?

835
00:33:54,636 --> 00:33:56,202
The day I'm honored, you're getting...

836
00:33:56,204 --> 00:33:57,803
I can't fucking believe this.

837
00:33:57,805 --> 00:33:59,038
You're getting married tomorrow?

838
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,542
Yes! Yes, it's been planned for months.

839
00:34:02,544 --> 00:34:04,745
Don't do it!

840
00:34:04,747 --> 00:34:07,114
I...

841
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:12,319
While Goldberg was asleep one night,

842
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:14,522
the devil entered his apartment

843
00:34:14,524 --> 00:34:16,691
and abducted his beautiful blond love

844
00:34:16,693 --> 00:34:18,860
and carried her off to hell.

845
00:34:18,862 --> 00:34:20,295
The following morning,

846
00:34:20,297 --> 00:34:25,100
Goldberg noticed the odd
smell of burning sulfur.

847
00:34:30,339 --> 00:34:32,040
Harry Block?

848
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:33,408
Yeah. You're cookie?

849
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:34,575
Cookie Williams.

850
00:34:34,577 --> 00:34:36,912
You wanted me here at 10:00?

851
00:34:36,914 --> 00:34:38,547
Yeah. Jeez.

852
00:34:40,283 --> 00:34:42,785
So, uh...

853
00:34:43,353 --> 00:34:45,921
You wanna... shall we get to it?

854
00:34:45,923 --> 00:34:48,992
Uh, you don't want to talk
a little while first?

855
00:34:48,994 --> 00:34:50,627
Talk? Why?

856
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:54,397
Most guys don't like to
just jump right into bed

857
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:55,465
without a little talking.

858
00:34:55,467 --> 00:34:58,034
They think it's a little
too businesslike.

859
00:34:58,036 --> 00:34:58,835
Oh, not me.

860
00:34:58,837 --> 00:35:00,204
You would tie me up.

861
00:35:00,206 --> 00:35:01,305
Whatever you want. But first,

862
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,641
let's get the monetary part
out of the way,

863
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,009
and then we can relax.

864
00:35:05,011 --> 00:35:06,243
Absolutely. You get 200?

865
00:35:06,245 --> 00:35:07,511
That's right. There you go.

866
00:35:07,513 --> 00:35:10,280
So you want me
to tie you up, that's it?

867
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:12,750
I'd like you to hit me a little bit

868
00:35:12,752 --> 00:35:13,951
and give me a blow job.

869
00:35:13,953 --> 00:35:16,120
Ok, a blow job, then hit you.

870
00:35:16,122 --> 00:35:18,489
No, no. Hit me and then the blow job.

871
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,424
I want to get the order right.

872
00:35:20,426 --> 00:35:21,392
Otherwise, it's no fun.

873
00:35:21,394 --> 00:35:23,694
Tie me up, hit me, give me a blow job.

874
00:35:23,696 --> 00:35:26,264
What do you want me to tie you with?

875
00:35:26,266 --> 00:35:28,867
I thought you were
gonna wear stockings.

876
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:31,236
Cookie, you're a definite
artist. Definitely, you...

877
00:35:31,238 --> 00:35:34,139
they should put your lips
in the Smithsonian.

878
00:35:34,141 --> 00:35:35,842
It took you a long time.

879
00:35:35,844 --> 00:35:37,243
I didn't think you'd make it.

880
00:35:37,245 --> 00:35:40,446
I was having a little problem
focusing for a while.

881
00:35:40,448 --> 00:35:42,115
Finally, I got the right fantasy.

882
00:35:42,117 --> 00:35:45,818
I thought of a woman I saw
on sixth Avenue today,

883
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,621
and I coupled her with Svetlana Stalin.

884
00:35:48,623 --> 00:35:50,857
It's the daughter of the dictator.

885
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:51,924
It worked for me.

886
00:35:51,926 --> 00:35:54,961
What do you take medicine for?

887
00:35:54,963 --> 00:35:56,396
Me? Depression.

888
00:35:56,398 --> 00:35:58,297
What are you depressed about?

889
00:35:58,299 --> 00:36:00,100
Depressed. Don't you
ever get depressed?

890
00:36:00,102 --> 00:36:03,337
Doesn't your work ever get
you down, or, you know...

891
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:06,006
It's ok. Beats the hell
out of waitressing.

892
00:36:06,008 --> 00:36:08,876
You know, it's funny.
Every hooker I ever speak to

893
00:36:08,878 --> 00:36:11,279
tells me that it beats
the hell out of waitressing.

894
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:12,281
Waitressing's got to be

895
00:36:12,282 --> 00:36:14,315
the worst fucking job in the world.

896
00:36:14,317 --> 00:36:15,483
It's unbelievable.

897
00:36:15,485 --> 00:36:17,519
What are you sad about?

898
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:21,089
I'm... I'm spiritually bankrupt.
I'm empty.

899
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:22,457
What do you mean?

900
00:36:22,459 --> 00:36:23,692
I'm... I'm... I'm frightened.

901
00:36:23,694 --> 00:36:27,128
I, uh, I got no soul.
You know what I mean?

902
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:31,833
When I was younger, it was
less scary waiting for lefty

903
00:36:31,835 --> 00:36:34,537
than it is waiting for Godot.

904
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:36,605
Uh, you lost me.

905
00:36:36,607 --> 00:36:39,075
You know that the universe
is coming apart?

906
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:42,445
Do you know about that?
You know what a black hole is?

907
00:36:42,447 --> 00:36:44,747
Yeah. That's how I make my living.

908
00:36:44,749 --> 00:36:46,850
You know, I got to tell you, cookie,

909
00:36:46,852 --> 00:36:48,585
a great writer named Sophocles

910
00:36:48,587 --> 00:36:52,022
said that it was probably
best not to be born at all.

911
00:36:52,024 --> 00:36:54,257
Honey, it's a little too late for that.

912
00:36:54,259 --> 00:36:55,992
Mmm. I fought it.

913
00:36:55,994 --> 00:36:59,764
I didn't want to come out.
They had to come in and get me.

914
00:36:59,766 --> 00:37:03,633
You want another blow job?

915
00:37:03,635 --> 00:37:04,367
How come?

916
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:05,802
It's on the house, no charge,

917
00:37:05,804 --> 00:37:08,805
'cause them pills you taking
sure as hell ain't working.

918
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:12,076
I'm just in a peculiar mood
tonight, you know?

919
00:37:12,078 --> 00:37:14,679
'Cause I had some bad news today.

920
00:37:14,681 --> 00:37:19,083
Hey, let me ask you a question.
What are you doing tomorrow?

921
00:37:19,085 --> 00:37:20,051
Hustlin'.

922
00:37:20,053 --> 00:37:23,355
Yeah? Why don't you come with me?

923
00:37:23,357 --> 00:37:26,291
I'm going up to my old school

924
00:37:26,293 --> 00:37:28,293
'cause they're gonna honor me.

925
00:37:28,295 --> 00:37:29,962
I got nobody to share it with.

926
00:37:29,964 --> 00:37:31,697
I'm serious. Come with me.

927
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:34,033
I'll give you 500 bucks for the day.

928
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:36,569
Sleep here tonight,
come up with me tomorrow.

929
00:37:36,571 --> 00:37:38,204
How come you got all this money?

930
00:37:38,206 --> 00:37:40,672
I always keep hooker money around

931
00:37:40,674 --> 00:37:42,841
'cause I once paid by check years ago

932
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:45,512
and the IRS killed me.

933
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:52,652
Mmm.

934
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:54,187
Mmm.

935
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,889
Mmm.

936
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:59,326
Fay, when you get this message,

937
00:37:59,328 --> 00:38:01,061
if it's not too late,

938
00:38:01,063 --> 00:38:03,397
I don't want you to get married

939
00:38:03,399 --> 00:38:08,436
because I love you and
I want to marry you.

940
00:38:08,438 --> 00:38:09,905
You...

941
00:38:09,907 --> 00:38:13,842
I was... I was looking at my last book,

942
00:38:13,844 --> 00:38:15,510
the part where we met,

943
00:38:15,512 --> 00:38:19,146
and, you know, I tried to exaggerate it

944
00:38:19,148 --> 00:38:20,415
to make it funny,

945
00:38:20,417 --> 00:38:24,719
but it was actually very romantic.

946
00:38:25,022 --> 00:38:28,957
I'm in town. Norman's
meeting me to see<i> Les Mis.</i>

947
00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:30,225
I have a free hour.

948
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:32,862
I... I... I don't know if I can.

949
00:38:32,864 --> 00:38:35,131
I got our usual place at the Wyndham.

950
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:36,666
It's been almost 2 weeks.

951
00:38:36,668 --> 00:38:39,468
Uh, we'll have to make it fast.

952
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:42,972
I can't make it believable for so long.

953
00:38:46,611 --> 00:38:48,045
You'll be back in an hour.

954
00:38:48,047 --> 00:38:52,249
I have to be done by then anyway.

955
00:38:54,385 --> 00:38:56,521
Think I'll take a walk.

956
00:38:56,523 --> 00:39:02,192
Oh, yes, 'cause I thought
that I would just, you know,

957
00:39:02,194 --> 00:39:05,696
take a... just to get some fresh air.

958
00:39:05,698 --> 00:39:07,665
Oh.

959
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:10,468
Ok.

960
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:38,297
Excuse me.

961
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:40,633
Are you Harry block?

962
00:39:40,635 --> 00:39:44,938
Your writing has been
so meaningful to me.

963
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,473
Thank you very much.

964
00:39:46,475 --> 00:39:48,875
Can't believe I'm in
the elevator with you.

965
00:39:48,877 --> 00:39:51,077
Well, it's no big deal.

966
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:52,846
Are you staying here?

967
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:56,651
No. No, I'm meeting someone.

968
00:40:04,293 --> 00:40:06,928
Oh, my God.

969
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,497
What is this?

970
00:40:08,499 --> 00:40:10,699
It's stuck again. Again?

971
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:12,334
If this was one of my stories,

972
00:40:12,336 --> 00:40:14,535
this elevator would get
stuck between floors

973
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:18,640
and the two of us would start
a major affair and fall in love.

974
00:40:28,985 --> 00:40:32,789
Promise me that you won't
fall in love with me.

975
00:40:32,791 --> 00:40:33,690
No?

976
00:40:33,692 --> 00:40:37,126
No. Definitely not. Not a good idea.

977
00:40:37,128 --> 00:40:42,299
Because I'm... I'm
too screwed up, you know?

978
00:40:42,301 --> 00:40:46,670
I have too many... too many quirks,

979
00:40:46,672 --> 00:40:51,075
too many... you know, I have
trouble being faithful.

980
00:40:51,077 --> 00:40:55,245
I have trouble, you know,
too many phobias and craziness.

981
00:40:55,247 --> 00:40:59,249
Yeah, but I fell in love
with you before I met you,

982
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:01,018
when I read you.

983
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,253
Yes, but you fell in love with my work.

984
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:06,024
That's a different thing, you know?

985
00:41:06,026 --> 00:41:10,228
I love your work.
I love your imagination.

986
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:14,366
But this is... this is not a book.

987
00:41:14,368 --> 00:41:15,633
You know what I mean?

988
00:41:15,635 --> 00:41:19,572
We're not characters
in a fictional thing.

989
00:41:19,574 --> 00:41:23,109
I mean, this is...
so don't fall in love.

990
00:41:23,111 --> 00:41:27,346
Promise you won't fall in love with me.

991
00:41:27,348 --> 00:41:28,114
I promise.

992
00:41:28,116 --> 00:41:30,483
You promise? Promise.

993
00:41:48,202 --> 00:41:50,904
The subway took forever. I'm sorry.

994
00:41:50,906 --> 00:41:53,741
You said you weren't coming.

995
00:41:53,743 --> 00:41:55,476
What do you mean? No. We said 10:00.

996
00:41:55,478 --> 00:41:56,711
I'm sure that's what we said.

997
00:41:56,713 --> 00:41:57,612
No. When we left...

998
00:41:57,614 --> 00:41:58,546
I called you last night,

999
00:41:58,548 --> 00:41:59,981
and I said that I got out of my thing.

1000
00:41:59,983 --> 00:42:01,149
You called me? When did you call me?

1001
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,384
I called you at 9:30
last night, remember?

1002
00:42:03,386 --> 00:42:05,721
I mean, you were writing...

1003
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:07,189
we spoke on the phone?

1004
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,589
Of course. Absolutely.

1005
00:42:08,591 --> 00:42:10,958
God, my mind has been
playing tricks on me.

1006
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,227
Cookie Williams,
this is my friend Richard.

1007
00:42:13,229 --> 00:42:15,831
What's so special
about this honor anyway?

1008
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:16,765
Well, the man is being honored

1009
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:18,834
by the very school
that once expelled him.

1010
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:20,502
Yeah. If only Hilly could see me...

1011
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:21,670
he'd be so proud.

1012
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:26,675
But short of kidnapping,
he ain't coming.

1013
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:29,112
Oh, dear.

1014
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,247
This is ridiculous.

1015
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:34,284
You're going to get
in trouble. Come on back.

1016
00:42:34,286 --> 00:42:36,619
Come on, boys.

1017
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:38,422
Dad?

1018
00:42:38,423 --> 00:42:41,192
No, we're not going
to go to school today.

1019
00:42:41,194 --> 00:42:43,661
Hey! What are you doing? Hey, stop it!

1020
00:42:43,663 --> 00:42:44,728
I got... it's an emergency.

1021
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,596
What are you doing? Come on, Hilly.

1022
00:42:46,598 --> 00:42:49,065
Hey! You! Stop! Stop it!

1023
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,567
Stop it! You can't do this!

1024
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:51,502
Hilly, get out of the car!

1025
00:42:51,504 --> 00:42:53,671
Get out of the car! Get out of the car!

1026
00:42:53,673 --> 00:42:56,273
Hey! Hey! Somebody stop this man!

1027
00:42:56,275 --> 00:42:57,541
He's a deviant!

1028
00:42:58,478 --> 00:42:59,310
Somebody stop him!

1029
00:42:59,312 --> 00:43:00,611
Somebody call the police!

Hey, look, a Ferris wheel.

1048
00:43:32,273 --> 00:43:33,872
Whoa. Look at the swings.

1049
00:43:33,874 --> 00:43:35,406
Want to go?

1050
00:43:35,408 --> 00:43:37,007
Yeah.

1051
00:43:42,546 --> 00:43:44,313
Very good.

1052
00:43:44,315 --> 00:43:47,315
Would you like yours?

1053
00:43:47,317 --> 00:43:48,650
Yay!

1054
00:43:48,652 --> 00:43:50,852
Dad, high-five.

1055
00:43:55,156 --> 00:43:57,390
But I am going to smoke
this joint. You want some?

1056
00:43:57,392 --> 00:43:59,858
No. I can't stand that stuff.

1057
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:02,427
You see that place there?

1058
00:44:02,429 --> 00:44:03,762
That red apple rest?

1059
00:44:03,764 --> 00:44:08,366
Years ago, my then-wife Jane and I

1060
00:44:08,368 --> 00:44:09,767
were coming back from Connecticut...

1061
00:44:09,768 --> 00:44:10,867
her sister's house...

1062
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:12,868
and we had this awful fight.

1063
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:13,970
She was having her period,

1064
00:44:13,972 --> 00:44:14,771
and we stopped off there

1065
00:44:14,773 --> 00:44:16,238
to get some water for her Midol.

1066
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,773
I don't want to have a child,

1067
00:44:17,775 --> 00:44:19,340
and I wish you wouldn't
keep bringing it up,

1068
00:44:19,342 --> 00:44:21,242
especially, in front of my parents.

1069
00:44:21,244 --> 00:44:24,211
Understand? Harry, we've discussed it.

1070
00:44:24,213 --> 00:44:25,179
Yes, but don't I get a vote?

1071
00:44:25,181 --> 00:44:26,513
You<i> have</i> a child.

1072
00:44:26,515 --> 00:44:28,248
Yes, who I never get to see.

1073
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,515
That's not my fault.

1074
00:44:29,517 --> 00:44:30,883
I like being a father.

1075
00:44:30,885 --> 00:44:32,717
I chose a different life than Lucy.

1076
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:34,052
You knew that when you married me.

1077
00:44:34,054 --> 00:44:35,086
So you're dedicated to your work,

1078
00:44:35,088 --> 00:44:36,687
and that means we can never
have any children.

1079
00:44:36,689 --> 00:44:38,423
Since when are you such a family man?

1080
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:42,592
Don't think I don't see you
staring at my sister Lucy.

1081
00:44:42,594 --> 00:44:43,459
What?

1082
00:44:43,461 --> 00:44:44,827
Oh, don't play ignorant.

1083
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:46,395
You watch her walk. You watch her sit.

1084
00:44:46,397 --> 00:44:49,131
You... you can't keep
your eyes off her toes.

1085
00:44:49,133 --> 00:44:51,633
Her toes? Are you fucking nuts?

1086
00:44:51,635 --> 00:44:54,335
I'm suggesting that I
wouldn't put it past you

1087
00:44:54,337 --> 00:44:57,070
if you weren't dying to
have a thing with her.

1088
00:44:57,072 --> 00:45:00,039
She's a neurotic, suburban hausfrau.

1089
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:01,740
I have no interest in her. Zero.

1090
00:45:01,742 --> 00:45:05,276
Uh-huh. Your level of denial
is a little intense,

1091
00:45:05,278 --> 00:45:09,613
from a premenstrual nuclear meltdown.

1092
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:11,781
You want a hit?

1093
00:45:11,783 --> 00:45:13,617
Huh? Oh, no, no.

1094
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:16,152
That smoke is killing me.

1095
00:45:16,154 --> 00:45:18,486
Listen, I'm going to go
over to the bathroom.

1096
00:45:18,488 --> 00:45:20,789
I'll catch you later.

1097
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:35,867
Cold fish, your third ex-wife.

1098
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:38,836
She never would have
made a good mother.

1099
00:45:38,838 --> 00:45:40,905
Who are you?

1100
00:45:40,907 --> 00:45:43,406
It's me. Ken.

1101
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:44,341
Ken?

1102
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:49,144
You created me.
Now you don't recognize me?

1103
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:52,046
I'm a little bit high
because of her smoke.

1104
00:45:52,048 --> 00:45:54,315
How'd you ever hook up with Jane?

1105
00:45:54,317 --> 00:45:56,917
Jane was fine. Jane was
just having her period,

1106
00:45:56,919 --> 00:46:00,253
Oh, no, no, it wasn't just her period.

1107
00:46:00,255 --> 00:46:03,255
She was a cold, selfish woman.

1108
00:46:03,257 --> 00:46:07,492
She doesn't realize
her sister hates her.

1109
00:46:07,494 --> 00:46:09,493
Hey, how do you know so much?

1110
00:46:09,495 --> 00:46:12,696
I'm just you, thinly disguised.

1111
00:46:12,698 --> 00:46:14,231
You gave me a little more maturity

1112
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:16,933
and a different name.

1113
00:46:16,935 --> 00:46:18,967
What are you saying? That I know this?

1114
00:46:18,969 --> 00:46:21,502
Of course you do.
That's why you picked her,

1115
00:46:21,504 --> 00:46:22,638
so it wouldn't work...

1116
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,905
so you'd never have
to give up sport-fucking

1117
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:27,540
and chronic dissatisfaction
and grow up.

1118
00:46:27,542 --> 00:46:29,509
Hey, I'm not going to stand out here

1119
00:46:29,511 --> 00:46:31,543
and get lectured by my own creation.

1120
00:46:31,545 --> 00:46:33,746
Uh, uh, uh, you can't fool me.

1121
00:46:33,748 --> 00:46:35,347
I'm not like your shrink.

1122
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:37,149
He only knows what you tell him.

1123
00:46:37,151 --> 00:46:38,049
I know the truth.

1124
00:46:38,051 --> 00:46:39,617
And then, her sister Lucy...

1125
00:46:40,453 --> 00:46:41,985
Another head case.

1126
00:46:41,987 --> 00:46:42,853
Wow.

1127
00:46:42,855 --> 00:46:44,453
You sure can pick them.

1128
00:46:44,455 --> 00:46:46,623
But even she was better than Jane...

1129
00:46:46,625 --> 00:46:49,225
more maternal, and she loved you.

1130
00:46:49,227 --> 00:46:51,726
You weren't there the day
your bomb dropped on her,

1131
00:46:51,728 --> 00:46:54,895
but take a look.

1132
00:46:56,665 --> 00:46:57,697
He left me.

1133
00:46:57,699 --> 00:47:00,467
It's over. Our marriage is finished.

1134
00:47:00,469 --> 00:47:03,569
I'm so sorry to hear that.

1135
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:04,770
Are you shocked?

1136
00:47:04,772 --> 00:47:06,438
Yes and no.

1137
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,941
Things have not been
very good for some time.

1138
00:47:09,943 --> 00:47:12,410
I knew he played around.

1139
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,844
Did you? You never mentioned that.

1140
00:47:14,846 --> 00:47:17,913
I don't like to discuss
my private life.

1141
00:47:17,915 --> 00:47:20,415
At first, I suspected Lynn, his editor,

1142
00:47:20,417 --> 00:47:21,850
but then I thought,

1143
00:47:21,852 --> 00:47:22,885
no, it might be

1144
00:47:22,887 --> 00:47:25,319
Allison Davis, a friend of ours.

1145
00:47:25,321 --> 00:47:29,322
I even thought he might
have a crush on you.

1146
00:47:29,324 --> 00:47:30,256
Me?

1147
00:47:30,258 --> 00:47:31,424
Well, you're very beautiful,

1148
00:47:31,426 --> 00:47:33,427
and we've spent a lot of time together,

1149
00:47:33,429 --> 00:47:36,961
and you two get along very well.

1150
00:47:36,963 --> 00:47:39,898
I knew you never would
in a million years,

1151
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,567
but I imagined he longed for you.

1152
00:47:44,569 --> 00:47:46,603
I think I even heard him
mention your name

1153
00:47:46,605 --> 00:47:49,072
in his sleep once.

1154
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,807
My goodness.

1155
00:47:52,975 --> 00:47:54,542
Well...

1156
00:47:55,243 --> 00:47:57,778
That's absurd. I mean...

1157
00:47:58,947 --> 00:48:00,513
Really.

1158
00:48:01,415 --> 00:48:03,315
You're all red.

1159
00:48:03,317 --> 00:48:05,350
No. No.

1160
00:48:06,419 --> 00:48:08,787
Lucy, are you ok?

1161
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:10,455
Look...

1162
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:14,057
Since we're talking openly...

1163
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:18,027
I have a confession to make.

1164
00:48:18,029 --> 00:48:18,961
Yes?

1165
00:48:18,963 --> 00:48:20,529
Look...

1166
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:26,500
Life sometimes takes
very strange twists and turns,

1167
00:48:26,502 --> 00:48:29,203
and we're not responsible
for our feelings.

1168
00:48:29,205 --> 00:48:31,337
You know, everybody's
feelings are irrational.

1169
00:48:31,339 --> 00:48:33,005
Yes, but to hear from your husband

1170
00:48:33,007 --> 00:48:35,641
that he found another woman...

1171
00:48:35,643 --> 00:48:36,875
He...

1172
00:48:36,877 --> 00:48:41,545
He said his future is all mapped out.

1173
00:48:42,247 --> 00:48:43,747
Oh.

1174
00:48:44,683 --> 00:48:45,850
Jane...

1175
00:48:45,852 --> 00:48:47,584
I'm going to be totally Frank with you

1176
00:48:47,586 --> 00:48:49,718
and just try and hang on...

1177
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,620
what can I say? I'm being replaced.

1178
00:48:51,622 --> 00:48:54,088
Yes, yes, but it doesn't
have to be a nightmare

1179
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:55,791
if we're all just mature about it.

1180
00:48:55,793 --> 00:49:00,727
Replaced by a 25-year-old.

1181
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:03,462
A 25-year-old... a wannabe writer.

1182
00:49:03,464 --> 00:49:07,265
Fay Sexton is her sexy name.

1183
00:49:08,335 --> 00:49:11,936
What's the matter? Now you're white.

1184
00:49:13,071 --> 00:49:14,071
Lucy...

1185
00:49:14,073 --> 00:49:17,540
Lucy, have you eaten anything today?

1186
00:49:18,877 --> 00:49:21,444
Lucy, have a drink. Have a drink.

1187
00:49:21,446 --> 00:49:22,778
Finish that.

1188
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:25,480
Hard to believe him
when he's such a liar.

1189
00:49:25,482 --> 00:49:26,647
I'm weak.

1190
00:49:28,618 --> 00:49:31,252
Lucy, Lucy, what's wrong?

1191
00:49:31,254 --> 00:49:33,920
You'd think he dumped you.

1192
00:49:33,922 --> 00:49:35,988
Look, I know you feel bad for me,

1193
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:37,856
- Air.
- But I can handle it.

1194
00:49:37,858 --> 00:49:40,658
I'm in shock today, but...

1195
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,794
I want to speak to fay.

1196
00:49:42,796 --> 00:49:45,729
I've been trying to
reach her since last night.

1197
00:49:45,731 --> 00:49:48,031
What? No, this is an emergency.

1198
00:49:48,033 --> 00:49:49,165
I've got to talk...

1199
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:51,534
tell her to call me back.
She's got my number.

1200
00:49:51,536 --> 00:49:53,368
Harry. It's the car number.

1201
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:56,304
Harry, give up. She's
in love with someone else.

1202
00:49:56,306 --> 00:49:58,339
This guy is too old for her.

1203
00:49:58,341 --> 00:49:59,439
He's younger than you are.

1204
00:49:59,441 --> 00:50:01,341
Hey, I'm much too old for her.

1205
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,074
It's ridiculous.

1206
00:50:02,076 --> 00:50:03,376
But because of my immaturity,

1207
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:04,977
I have a boyish quality that works.

1208
00:50:04,979 --> 00:50:06,746
Is it much longer, dad?

1209
00:50:06,748 --> 00:50:08,214
We were just at the fair.

1210
00:50:08,216 --> 00:50:09,347
You walked around. You ate.

1211
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:10,816
About how much longer is it?

1212
00:50:10,818 --> 00:50:12,016
It won't be long.

1213
00:50:12,018 --> 00:50:12,983
Dad...

1214
00:50:12,985 --> 00:50:15,752
my sister lives 10 minutes from here.

1215
00:50:15,754 --> 00:50:17,554
We'll turn off. We'll surprise her.

1216
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:20,857
She's your half sister, actually.

1217
00:50:20,859 --> 00:50:21,825
Yeah, she's my half sister,

1218
00:50:21,827 --> 00:50:23,091
but it'll still be 10 minutes,

1219
00:50:23,093 --> 00:50:26,260
not 5, just because
she's a half sister,

1220
00:50:26,262 --> 00:50:27,795
so...

1221
00:50:30,966 --> 00:50:32,632
It's wonderful.

1222
00:50:32,634 --> 00:50:34,100
Ah, it is so funny.

1223
00:50:34,102 --> 00:50:34,868
Do you think so?

1224
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:36,702
Yeah, and it's really sad.

1225
00:50:36,704 --> 00:50:37,636
Oh, I really loved it.

1226
00:50:37,638 --> 00:50:39,704
You're so great. You're so kind to me.

1227
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:43,541
You know, you have such
a sweet, kind instinct.

1228
00:50:43,543 --> 00:50:44,776
Harry...

1229
00:50:44,778 --> 00:50:46,710
Harry, don't do that.

1230
00:50:46,712 --> 00:50:50,046
I count on you to really be critical,

1231
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:51,180
to really be tough.

1232
00:50:51,182 --> 00:50:52,147
You're too easy on me.

1233
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:54,016
What? What was wrong with the story?

1234
00:50:54,018 --> 00:50:56,184
What was wrong with it
is that it had...

1235
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,686
It had no energy.

1236
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,087
I became very discouraged with it.

1237
00:51:00,089 --> 00:51:02,856
It's got... it doesn't
release any power.

1238
00:51:02,858 --> 00:51:03,790
It came to nothing.

1239
00:51:03,792 --> 00:51:06,192
No. I thought it was really touching.

1240
00:51:06,194 --> 00:51:08,293
I mean, you knew when the boy grew up

1241
00:51:08,295 --> 00:51:10,596
that he would never learn to love.

1242
00:51:10,598 --> 00:51:14,498
I think your problem
is you love too easily.

1243
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,735
I think you're beautiful and great

1244
00:51:17,737 --> 00:51:20,003
and too kind to me

1245
00:51:20,005 --> 00:51:22,371
and lovely.

1246
00:51:22,373 --> 00:51:24,672
But you're not in love with me.

1247
00:51:24,674 --> 00:51:27,342
I told you not to fall in love with me,

1248
00:51:27,344 --> 00:51:32,412
Yeah, but I still have not
been able to figure out why.

1249
00:51:32,414 --> 00:51:36,382
Why? Because I'm the boy in that story.

1250
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,650
And I can't love,

1251
00:51:37,652 --> 00:51:40,586
so I don't want you
to get into anything.

1252
00:51:40,588 --> 00:51:43,288
Well, you love Hilly.

1253
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:44,256
What?

1254
00:51:44,258 --> 00:51:45,923
You love Hilly.

1255
00:51:45,925 --> 00:51:47,424
Mmm.

1256
00:51:48,492 --> 00:51:50,993
Sure, I love Hilly,
because Hilly's my son.

1257
00:51:50,995 --> 00:51:54,429
It's easy to love
a little kid, you know.

1258
00:51:54,431 --> 00:51:56,732
Yeah, but you love music.

1259
00:51:56,734 --> 00:51:57,366
Yes.

1260
00:51:57,368 --> 00:51:58,399
And you love baseball.

1261
00:51:58,401 --> 00:52:00,534
Baseball's also easy,
because it has rules.

1262
00:52:00,536 --> 00:52:02,535
It has foul lines, you know, and...

1263
00:52:02,537 --> 00:52:05,538
But women are complicated.

1264
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,940
Mmm.

1265
00:52:06,942 --> 00:52:07,840
Mmm.

1266
00:52:07,842 --> 00:52:08,774
Happy Birthday.

1267
00:52:08,776 --> 00:52:10,276
Ohh. You're kidding.

1268
00:52:10,278 --> 00:52:11,576
Come on, open it up.

1269
00:52:11,578 --> 00:52:13,044
You... this is...

1270
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:15,780
You didn't have to get me anything.

1271
00:52:15,782 --> 00:52:18,015
It's probably another sweater, right?

1272
00:52:18,017 --> 00:52:19,483
Mmm.

1273
00:52:19,485 --> 00:52:23,052
A baseball signed by the 1951 giants.

1274
00:52:23,054 --> 00:52:25,487
Really? That's so great.

1275
00:52:25,489 --> 00:52:26,621
The '51 giants were...

1276
00:52:26,623 --> 00:52:30,558
The one genuine miracle of my lifetime.

1277
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,458
That's so great.

1278
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:32,526
When he hit that home run,

1279
00:52:32,528 --> 00:52:34,360
that was the only hint I've ever had

1280
00:52:34,362 --> 00:52:36,296
that there may be a God.

1281
00:52:36,298 --> 00:52:38,530
That's so... you know...

1282
00:52:38,532 --> 00:52:40,233
What made you think of that?

1283
00:52:40,235 --> 00:52:41,266
Mmm.

1284
00:52:41,268 --> 00:52:42,134
It was easy.

1285
00:52:42,136 --> 00:52:44,869
You're the greatest.

1286
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:45,871
You are the greatest.

1287
00:52:45,872 --> 00:52:46,904
Well, it's your birthday today,

1288
00:52:46,906 --> 00:52:48,738
so you get any wish you want.

1289
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:52,709
Yes, anything at all that
would make your day special.

1290
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,677
Good.

1291
00:52:54,378 --> 00:52:55,577
You are the greatest.

1292
00:52:55,579 --> 00:52:56,879
I don't deserve you.

1293
00:52:56,881 --> 00:52:59,047
You know, you're too...

1294
00:52:59,049 --> 00:53:00,580
Too...

1295
00:53:06,916 --> 00:53:08,055
So we were driving.

1296
00:53:08,056 --> 00:53:10,755
We thought we'd stop in to see you.

1297
00:53:10,757 --> 00:53:12,757
This is Richard. This is cookie.

1298
00:53:12,759 --> 00:53:13,891
Hi, Richard.

1299
00:53:13,893 --> 00:53:15,427
Hello, darling, I'm your aunt Doris.

1300
00:53:15,429 --> 00:53:16,428
I bet you don't even remember me.

1301
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:17,728
Do you remember your Uncle Burt?

1302
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,063
You haven't seen him in awhile.

1303
00:53:19,065 --> 00:53:20,763
Oh, thank you.

1304
00:53:20,765 --> 00:53:21,698
Burt, get Hilly a sandwich.

1305
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,598
Would you like something to eat?

1306
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,766
Maybe a cookie or something like that?

1307
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:26,802
Come in the kitchen here.

1308
00:53:26,804 --> 00:53:27,936
I just got to go to the bathroom.

1309
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:30,204
Where's the John, honey?

1310
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:32,139
Yeah, you just go right through there.

1311
00:53:32,141 --> 00:53:33,540
Over there? Yeah.

1312
00:53:33,542 --> 00:53:35,108
So, I thought we'd drop in.

1313
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:35,942
Do you like that?

1314
00:53:35,944 --> 00:53:37,409
I'll have some water.

1315
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:39,945
Boy, you're the last
person in the world

1316
00:53:39,947 --> 00:53:41,747
I ever expected to see.

1317
00:53:41,749 --> 00:53:43,015
Don't say that, Doris.

1318
00:53:43,017 --> 00:53:44,716
Yeah, and what's with cookie?

1319
00:53:44,718 --> 00:53:45,783
Cookie's the nanny.

1320
00:53:45,785 --> 00:53:47,150
The nanny? Where did you get her from,

1321
00:53:47,152 --> 00:53:48,418
an agency or a massage parlor?

1322
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:51,521
Oh, Jesus, she's a sweet kid.
What are you picking on...

1323
00:53:51,523 --> 00:53:53,589
still with the sexpots, the tramps,

1324
00:53:53,591 --> 00:53:55,124
the<i> vihlde chayes.</i>

1325
00:53:55,126 --> 00:53:56,524
She's got a Ph.D., this girl.

1326
00:53:56,526 --> 00:53:58,326
Really? I don't know how
she did on her written,

1327
00:53:58,328 --> 00:54:00,995
but I'm sure she got
an "a" plus on her oral exam.

1328
00:54:00,997 --> 00:54:02,731
Hey, give me a break, will ya?

1329
00:54:02,733 --> 00:54:06,166
I'm driving upstate, I take the time
to drop in to say hello.

1330
00:54:06,168 --> 00:54:08,868
Can you believe that
they're honoring me at Adair?

1331
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,135
I can't believe it.

1332
00:54:10,137 --> 00:54:13,305
But it's great for Hilly,
I think, to see me.

1333
00:54:13,307 --> 00:54:15,941
The last time I saw him,
he was 6-years-old.

1334
00:54:15,943 --> 00:54:18,943
Well, you know, you don't
exactly contact me, either.

1335
00:54:18,945 --> 00:54:20,477
Well, I know what you think of me.

1336
00:54:20,479 --> 00:54:22,545
Oh, please, Doris, don't start in.

1337
00:54:22,547 --> 00:54:25,415
What, am I wrong? It's
all over your book...

1338
00:54:25,417 --> 00:54:28,283
"Jewish," "too Jewish,"
"professionally Jewish."

1339
00:54:28,285 --> 00:54:29,617
Of course, you attributed it all

1340
00:54:29,619 --> 00:54:30,619
to your ex-wife Joan,

1341
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,353
but you gave her the details of my life

1342
00:54:32,355 --> 00:54:34,454
because you wanted to depict her

1343
00:54:34,456 --> 00:54:36,757
Oh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1344
00:54:36,759 --> 00:54:38,492
Oh, you don't know
what I'm talking about?

1345
00:54:38,494 --> 00:54:40,860
You made a picture of
your ex as a horror.

1346
00:54:40,862 --> 00:54:42,094
And in order to make that picture

1347
00:54:42,096 --> 00:54:43,628
unsympathetic and unappetizing,

1348
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:45,163
yes, you used some
of her, but mostly...

1349
00:54:45,165 --> 00:54:48,633
mostly, you caricatured
my religious dedication,

1350
00:54:48,635 --> 00:54:51,135
because it has always enraged you

1351
00:54:51,137 --> 00:54:52,503
that I returned to my roots.

1352
00:54:52,505 --> 00:54:55,571
What roots? You were
a wonderful, sweet kid.

1353
00:54:55,573 --> 00:54:58,206
You know, you got me
through my childhood.

1354
00:54:58,208 --> 00:55:01,176
And, you know, then you
go away to fort Lauderdale,

1355
00:55:01,178 --> 00:55:04,345
and you meet this fanatic...
this zealot.

1356
00:55:04,347 --> 00:55:08,581
And he fills you full of superstition.

1357
00:55:08,583 --> 00:55:09,681
It's tradition.

1358
00:55:09,683 --> 00:55:12,318
Tradition is the illusion
of permanence.

1359
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,219
You have no values. Your whole life,

1360
00:55:14,221 --> 00:55:15,587
it's nihilism, it's cynicism,

1361
00:55:15,589 --> 00:55:17,822
it's sarcasm and orgasm.

1362
00:55:17,824 --> 00:55:22,225
In France, I could run
on that slogan and win.

1363
00:55:22,227 --> 00:55:24,394
I'm a Jew. I was born a Jew.

1364
00:55:24,396 --> 00:55:25,895
What, do you hate me because of that?

1365
00:55:25,897 --> 00:55:30,098
And if our parents
converted to Catholicism

1366
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,332
a month before you were born,

1367
00:55:31,334 --> 00:55:35,568
They're clubs. They're
exclusionary... all of them.

1368
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:38,605
You know, they foster
the concept of the other,

1369
00:55:38,607 --> 00:55:40,940
so you know clearly
who you should hate.

1370
00:55:40,942 --> 00:55:42,841
Oh, would you... that's enough.

1371
00:55:42,843 --> 00:55:45,310
Let me ask you a question.
If a Jew gets massacred,

1372
00:55:45,312 --> 00:55:49,046
does that bother you more
than if a gentile gets hurt

1373
00:55:49,048 --> 00:55:50,714
or a black or a Bosnian?

1374
00:55:50,716 --> 00:55:52,715
Yes, yes, yes. Yes, it does. It does.

1375
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:54,717
I can't help it. It's my people.

1376
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:56,251
They're all your people.

1377
00:55:56,253 --> 00:55:58,187
You know what? Burt is right about you.

1378
00:55:58,189 --> 00:55:59,988
You're a self-hating Jew.

1379
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:03,124
Hey, I may hate myself,
but not because I'm Jewish.

1380
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:04,692
Oh, he says he's not a self-hating Jew

1381
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,993
and look at how he talks about them

1382
00:56:06,995 --> 00:56:08,261
in his stories.

1383
00:56:08,263 --> 00:56:13,032
Max and Dolly Pincus
were married for 30 years,

1384
00:56:13,034 --> 00:56:16,234
and there was never a family
wedding or bar mitzvah

1385
00:56:16,236 --> 00:56:19,069
where they were not
generous participants.

1386
00:56:19,071 --> 00:56:20,237
Max, how are you?

1387
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:23,407
Yossel, mazel tov. Here.

1388
00:56:23,409 --> 00:56:24,641
For Donald.

1389
00:56:24,643 --> 00:56:26,409
Thank you, Max.

1390
00:56:30,847 --> 00:56:32,279
Dolly.

1391
00:56:32,281 --> 00:56:34,315
Dolly, you got a private minute?

1392
00:56:34,317 --> 00:56:37,651
We are leaving anyhow in a few minutes.

1393
00:56:39,154 --> 00:56:41,221
I don't even know if I should tell you.

1394
00:56:41,223 --> 00:56:43,088
What? Tell me what?

1395
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:45,056
Tell me, and I will tell you
if you should tell me.

1396
00:56:45,058 --> 00:56:47,659
Oh, Dolly, my heart is heavy.

1397
00:56:47,661 --> 00:56:51,162
Nothing terrible happened
to your husband Phil, did it?

1398
00:56:51,164 --> 00:56:54,864
He has been dead for so many years.

1399
00:56:54,866 --> 00:56:55,998
Well...

1400
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,501
When I was in Florida last week,

1401
00:56:58,503 --> 00:56:59,702
I ran into a man

1402
00:56:59,704 --> 00:57:03,438
who heard from someone
who knew someone who...

1403
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,940
Anyway, it seems Max has some secret

1404
00:57:06,942 --> 00:57:10,744
Max? You're talking about<i> my</i> Max?

1405
00:57:10,746 --> 00:57:12,111
Yep. A dark secret.

1406
00:57:12,113 --> 00:57:13,746
What kind of a dark secret?

1407
00:57:13,748 --> 00:57:17,182
What? What is by you dark?

1408
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:17,915
I don't know.

1409
00:57:17,917 --> 00:57:19,450
What kind of a dark secret?

1410
00:57:19,452 --> 00:57:22,520
We have been married
for 30 years already.

1411
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:23,988
You're his first wife?

1412
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:25,255
Well, sure, I'm a first wife.

1413
00:57:25,257 --> 00:57:27,157
Well, before me, he worked for...

1414
00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:29,591
Ok. Ok, ok, ok. All right.

1415
00:57:29,593 --> 00:57:30,826
What?

1416
00:57:30,828 --> 00:57:32,660
You heard something different?

1417
00:57:32,662 --> 00:57:34,328
I heard only a dark secret.

1418
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:36,397
Do I know <i>what</i> dark secret?

1419
00:57:36,399 --> 00:57:38,565
Who told you?

1420
00:57:39,233 --> 00:57:40,602
Wolf Fishbein.

1421
00:57:40,604 --> 00:57:41,606
Uhh...

1422
00:57:41,607 --> 00:57:43,543
be careful, Dolly.

1423
00:57:43,545 --> 00:57:45,615
That's all I want to say.

1424
00:57:45,617 --> 00:57:48,255
Dolly tried putting Elsie's words

1425
00:57:48,257 --> 00:57:49,158
out of her mind,

1426
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,831
but Max's dark secret plagued her.

1427
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:55,440
Then one day, she ran
into wolf Fishbein,

1428
00:57:55,442 --> 00:57:57,981
and the truth was revealed.

1429
00:57:57,983 --> 00:57:59,886
Breathe deeply. Try to breathe deeply.

1430
00:57:59,888 --> 00:58:03,026
Oy. You were right,
Elsie. You were right.

1431
00:58:03,028 --> 00:58:05,333
Fishbein told me a tale.

1432
00:58:05,335 --> 00:58:07,905
Max, before I met him,

1433
00:58:07,907 --> 00:58:09,577
he lived in Florida.

1434
00:58:09,579 --> 00:58:12,150
Oy. He had a store...

1435
00:58:12,152 --> 00:58:13,854
groceries.

1436
00:58:13,856 --> 00:58:15,057
He was married.

1437
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:16,026
He was married.

1438
00:58:16,028 --> 00:58:18,399
Now it comes out.

1439
00:58:18,401 --> 00:58:20,438
To a woman...

1440
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,908
With 2 children.

1441
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:23,847
Max had other children?

1442
00:58:23,849 --> 00:58:25,852
No. The woman's children,

1443
00:58:25,854 --> 00:58:28,992
From a prior marriage.

1444
00:58:28,995 --> 00:58:30,797
Aha.

1445
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,936
He began an affair

1446
00:58:32,938 --> 00:58:35,109
with the downstairs neighbor...

1447
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:38,751
He probably had all his hair then.

1448
00:58:38,753 --> 00:58:41,491
Meanwhile, he got into debt

1449
00:58:41,493 --> 00:58:43,596
deeper and deeper

1450
00:58:43,598 --> 00:58:47,139
and... and carry on with the neighbor.

1451
00:58:47,141 --> 00:58:48,877
Oy, my heart.

1452
00:58:48,879 --> 00:58:50,816
My heart.

1453
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:56,163
So he can't get himself
out of a predicament.

1454
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:57,265
So what does he do?

1455
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:59,472
You're going to tell me he stole money?

1456
00:58:59,474 --> 00:59:01,610
I should be so lucky.

1457
00:59:01,612 --> 00:59:04,182
He killed his wife.

1458
00:59:04,752 --> 00:59:06,322
No.

1459
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:08,963
The man purchased an ax.

1460
00:59:08,965 --> 00:59:10,232
With an ax?

1461
00:59:10,234 --> 00:59:11,268
And you know Max.

1462
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:12,738
He's nothing with tools.

1463
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:15,412
He can't even hang a picture.

1464
00:59:15,414 --> 00:59:16,882
I'm dropping dead.

1465
00:59:16,884 --> 00:59:18,987
Plus her children, Elsie.

1466
00:59:20,326 --> 00:59:22,229
Plus a neighbor.

1467
00:59:22,231 --> 00:59:26,540
4 people he killed
one night with an ax.

1468
00:59:26,543 --> 00:59:28,411
Your Max?

1469
00:59:28,413 --> 00:59:30,483
And this is not the capper.

1470
00:59:30,485 --> 00:59:32,522
There's more?

1471
00:59:32,524 --> 00:59:33,659
More.

1472
00:59:33,661 --> 00:59:35,363
More.

1473
00:59:35,365 --> 00:59:37,469
What more?

1474
00:59:38,003 --> 00:59:39,206
He ate them.

1475
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:41,545
What, are you talking crazy?

1476
00:59:41,547 --> 00:59:42,548
Elsie,

1477
00:59:42,549 --> 00:59:44,587
he devoured them.

1478
00:59:44,589 --> 00:59:46,625
I can't breathe.

1479
00:59:46,627 --> 00:59:48,797
Everything is closing in.

1480
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:50,802
Whatever you do,

1481
00:59:50,804 --> 00:59:52,940
first, hear Max's side.

1482
00:59:52,942 --> 00:59:54,646
Max has a side?

1483
00:59:54,648 --> 00:59:57,754
He kills his family and eats them up.

1484
00:59:57,756 --> 01:00:03,000
He was a good husband and
a loving father for 30 years.

1485
01:00:03,002 --> 01:00:05,038
You have a daughter
who went to college.

1486
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,582
You have a son who's a writer.

1487
01:00:08,584 --> 01:00:10,587
Maybe the best course of action

1488
01:00:10,589 --> 01:00:13,661
is let sleeping dogs lie.

1489
01:00:13,663 --> 01:00:17,169
Honey, would you pass the sour cream?

1490
01:00:21,114 --> 01:00:25,190
You, uh, haven't touched a thing.

1491
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:27,663
Nice weather!

1492
01:00:28,098 --> 01:00:29,100
It's ok.

1493
01:00:29,102 --> 01:00:30,939
It's not just ok.

1494
01:00:30,941 --> 01:00:32,208
It's nice!

1495
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:33,345
All right, all right.

1496
01:00:33,347 --> 01:00:34,848
What are you getting
so steamed up about?

1497
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:38,691
What makes<i> you</i> such an
authority on the weather?

1498
01:00:38,693 --> 01:00:40,028
Me?

1499
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:41,064
All I said...

1500
01:00:41,066 --> 01:00:43,337
I know, I know. I know what you said.

1501
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:45,209
The fish is delicious.

1502
01:00:45,211 --> 01:00:47,481
Wouldn't you rather have meat?

1503
01:00:47,483 --> 01:00:49,820
Since when do I eat meat?

1504
01:00:49,822 --> 01:00:50,656
Mm-hmm.

1505
01:00:50,658 --> 01:00:51,691
With my arteries,

1506
01:00:51,693 --> 01:00:54,132
you gotta watch out
for the cholesterol.

1507
01:00:54,134 --> 01:00:54,900
Uh-huh.

1508
01:00:54,902 --> 01:00:57,105
What is the "uh-huh"?

1509
01:00:57,107 --> 01:01:00,748
I mean, you've been very touchy lately.

1510
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:02,987
Don't interrogate me...

1511
01:01:02,989 --> 01:01:06,096
Mr. Max Pinchuck!

1512
01:01:11,276 --> 01:01:13,881
Where did you hear that name?

1513
01:01:13,883 --> 01:01:15,619
Did you kill your first wife

1514
01:01:15,621 --> 01:01:16,755
with an ax?

1515
01:01:16,757 --> 01:01:18,427
I gotta headache. Please.

1516
01:01:18,429 --> 01:01:20,264
Did you chop her up,

1517
01:01:20,266 --> 01:01:23,439
along with your mistress?

1518
01:01:24,275 --> 01:01:25,277
Ok.

1519
01:01:25,279 --> 01:01:27,249
If I tell you why I did it,

1520
01:01:27,251 --> 01:01:29,122
do you promise not to nudge me?

1521
01:01:29,124 --> 01:01:32,195
Wolf fishbein said
in order to hide the bodies

1522
01:01:32,197 --> 01:01:34,668
you<i> ate</i> them!

1523
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:37,876
So what are you making a fuss?

1524
01:01:37,878 --> 01:01:40,583
Some bury, some burn.

1525
01:01:40,585 --> 01:01:41,720
I ate.

1526
01:01:41,722 --> 01:01:43,223
Enough!

1527
01:01:43,225 --> 01:01:45,328
I remember Max Pincus' dark secret.

1528
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:46,565
That is a disgraceful story.

1529
01:01:46,567 --> 01:01:48,703
You don't see your sick
view of our parents?

1530
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,542
I wrote it when I was much younger.

1531
01:01:50,544 --> 01:01:52,548
The first of a number
of anti-Semitic pieces.

1532
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:54,987
Oh, here he is,
direct from the wailing wall.

1533
01:01:54,989 --> 01:01:56,791
Disrespectful, shameful.

1534
01:01:56,793 --> 01:01:58,229
The Jews haven't suffered enough

1535
01:01:58,231 --> 01:01:59,966
without being depicted by this one

1536
01:01:59,968 --> 01:02:01,369
and homicidal cannibals.

1537
01:02:01,371 --> 01:02:04,779
He's betting everything
on physics and pussy!

1538
01:02:04,781 --> 01:02:06,584
If you'll excuse the expression.

1539
01:02:06,586 --> 01:02:08,221
Yeah, wait till he gets cancer.

1540
01:02:08,223 --> 01:02:09,758
He'll be the first one in synagogue,

1541
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,830
sitting in the front row in a yarmulke.

1542
01:02:11,832 --> 01:02:13,734
Why should I get cancer?
I eat broccoli.

1543
01:02:13,736 --> 01:02:15,773
Do you care even about the holocaust,

1544
01:02:15,775 --> 01:02:17,143
or do you think it never happened?

1545
01:02:17,145 --> 01:02:19,550
Not only do I know
that we lost 6 million,

1546
01:02:19,552 --> 01:02:20,586
but the scary thing is

1547
01:02:20,588 --> 01:02:22,825
that records are made
to be broken, you know?

1548
01:02:22,827 --> 01:02:25,063
I mean, I know what's out there.

1549
01:02:25,065 --> 01:02:26,233
Do you have any idea?

1550
01:02:26,235 --> 01:02:28,273
He creates offensive Jewish stereotypes

1551
01:02:28,275 --> 01:02:29,643
like in <i>Der Sturmer.</i>

1552
01:02:29,645 --> 01:02:31,748
Max is a version of daddy...
a man you hated,

1553
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:33,920
a man you think committed the crime

1554
01:02:33,922 --> 01:02:34,956
of being a terrible parent.

1555
01:02:34,958 --> 01:02:37,428
Well, he<i> was</i> a terrible parent.

1556
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:39,735
Thank you for dropping by.

1557
01:02:39,737 --> 01:02:41,205
Please come again in another 4 years.

1558
01:02:41,207 --> 01:02:44,146
Hey, look, wouldn't it be
a better world

1559
01:02:44,148 --> 01:02:45,249
if not every group

1560
01:02:45,251 --> 01:02:47,822
thought they had a direct line to God?

1561
01:02:47,824 --> 01:02:50,329
He thinks I'm all Jewish paranoia.

1562
01:02:50,331 --> 01:02:52,200
No, I don't think you're paranoid.

1563
01:02:52,202 --> 01:02:53,871
I think you're
the opposite of a paranoid.

1564
01:02:53,873 --> 01:02:56,611
I think you go around
with the insane delusion

1565
01:02:56,613 --> 01:02:59,485
that people like you.

1566
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:08,642
What's the matter?

1567
01:03:08,644 --> 01:03:10,246
You son of a bitch!

1568
01:03:10,248 --> 01:03:11,115
What's wrong?

1569
01:03:11,117 --> 01:03:13,120
You sick, sick, sick,

1570
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:14,759
sick fucking bastard!

1571
01:03:14,761 --> 01:03:15,560
What's wrong?

1572
01:03:15,562 --> 01:03:16,696
What is wrong?! What is wrong?!

1573
01:03:16,698 --> 01:03:18,134
What do you think is wrong?

1574
01:03:18,136 --> 01:03:20,840
So you've had an affair
with one of my patients.

1575
01:03:20,842 --> 01:03:23,647
Don't act like you don't
know what I'm talking about!

1576
01:03:23,649 --> 01:03:25,819
You know what I'm talking about!

1577
01:03:25,821 --> 01:03:29,195
I just talked to her.
She told me the whole thing.

1578
01:03:29,197 --> 01:03:30,130
Who? Who?

1579
01:03:30,132 --> 01:03:31,467
Who? Who? Who?

1580
01:03:31,469 --> 01:03:32,837
Mrs. pollack.

1581
01:03:32,839 --> 01:03:34,074
Amy pollack.

1582
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:35,677
Can I explain something?

1583
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,947
You know Amy pollack?

1584
01:03:36,949 --> 01:03:38,519
No, you cannot explain anything,

1585
01:03:38,521 --> 01:03:39,688
you little fucking asshole!

1586
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:40,524
Will you calm down?

1587
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:42,796
Don't you tell me to calm down!

1588
01:03:42,798 --> 01:03:43,799
What's wrong?

1589
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,203
What is wrong?

1590
01:03:45,205 --> 01:03:46,806
I treat this woman,

1591
01:03:46,808 --> 01:03:48,110
and she exits,

1592
01:03:48,112 --> 01:03:49,747
and you meet her,

1593
01:03:49,749 --> 01:03:53,724
Supposing I told you
that my fucking Amy pollack

1594
01:03:53,726 --> 01:03:55,027
was a disguised plea

1595
01:03:55,029 --> 01:03:56,732
for more closeness with you.

1596
01:03:56,734 --> 01:03:59,806
Oh, God. Then I'd say
you were a mental case.

1597
01:03:59,808 --> 01:04:01,845
This is you with your first wife.

1598
01:04:01,847 --> 01:04:03,884
You were claiming that you loved her,

1599
01:04:03,886 --> 01:04:05,354
and that you couldn't live without her

1600
01:04:05,356 --> 01:04:07,593
while you're having
affair after affair.

1601
01:04:07,595 --> 01:04:08,863
My first wife, I told you,

1602
01:04:08,865 --> 01:04:11,335
I was laying in bed with her one night,

1603
01:04:11,337 --> 01:04:12,872
I turned off her

1604
01:04:12,874 --> 01:04:14,243
because the way the light struck her,

1605
01:04:14,245 --> 01:04:16,550
suddenly she looked to me
like Max Schmeling.

1606
01:04:16,552 --> 01:04:17,953
What do you want me to say?

1607
01:04:17,955 --> 01:04:19,456
Not that she wasn't a pretty girl,

1608
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:20,893
but she looked like Max Schmeling.

1609
01:04:20,895 --> 01:04:22,865
I couldn't get an erection after that.

1610
01:04:22,867 --> 01:04:24,770
Stop this tap-dancing!
This is bullshit, you understand me?

1611
01:04:24,772 --> 01:04:25,471
It is not bullshit.

1612
01:04:25,473 --> 01:04:26,206
It is bullshit!

1613
01:04:26,508 --> 01:04:28,808
With you, it's a completely different story
You turned off me.

1614
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:31,244
No, that's what happened,
ever since Hilly was born.

1615
01:04:31,246 --> 01:04:33,780
We've been living like brother and sister.
It's been platonic.

1616
01:04:33,782 --> 01:04:36,149
Don't try to play "blame the victim"!

1617
01:04:36,151 --> 01:04:37,451
What are you talking about?

1618
01:04:37,453 --> 01:04:40,321
I... hey, I'm as much a victim as you.

1619
01:04:40,323 --> 01:04:42,556
You know, you think
that getting a blow job

1620
01:04:42,558 --> 01:04:45,526
from a big-bosomed 26-year-old

1621
01:04:45,528 --> 01:04:46,927
is a pleasurable thing for me?

1622
01:04:46,929 --> 01:04:48,965
Oh, you're making me sick!

1623
01:04:48,967 --> 01:04:51,767
I can't believe this is happening.

1624
01:04:51,769 --> 01:04:52,902
You're overreacting.

1625
01:04:52,904 --> 01:04:54,103
I'm not overreacting!

1626
01:04:54,105 --> 01:04:55,905
You... you... are you trying
to tell me,

1627
01:04:55,907 --> 01:04:57,607
that every week for the last 4 months

1628
01:04:57,609 --> 01:05:00,410
that you've been with her in the hotel?

1629
01:05:00,412 --> 01:05:02,980
Oh, that's so crazy. No, of course not!

1630
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:05,549
I... you know, I rented an apartment.

1631
01:05:05,551 --> 01:05:07,784
Aah! I'm gonna kill you!

1632
01:05:07,786 --> 01:05:08,786
Wait! No!

1633
01:05:08,787 --> 01:05:10,554
Yes, I am!

1634
01:05:10,556 --> 01:05:11,388
Aah.

1635
01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:12,724
Hello, doctor.

1636
01:05:12,726 --> 01:05:14,425
I'm sorry I'm late.

1637
01:05:14,427 --> 01:05:18,062
Take off your coat. Come in.

1638
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:32,411
Uh...

1639
01:05:32,413 --> 01:05:33,512
I've been...

1640
01:05:33,514 --> 01:05:35,281
I've been losing sleep at night.

1641
01:05:35,283 --> 01:05:37,518
I can't shut my eyes at night.

1642
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,987
I... I think I should quit my job,

1643
01:05:39,989 --> 01:05:42,890
but I can't bring myself to do it.

1644
01:05:42,892 --> 01:05:43,958
Maybe because

1645
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,727
my brother-in-law treats me kindly.

1646
01:05:46,729 --> 01:05:48,463
But... but working for him

1647
01:05:48,465 --> 01:05:50,532
is taking its toll on me emotionally.

1648
01:05:50,534 --> 01:05:53,001
Could you excuse me, Mr. Farber?

1649
01:05:53,003 --> 01:05:54,703
What?

1650
01:05:57,607 --> 01:05:59,375
You fucked-up fuck!

1651
01:05:59,377 --> 01:06:02,278
I can't believe you fucking did this!

1652
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:03,579
You fucking asshole!

1653
01:06:03,581 --> 01:06:05,181
You fucked my patient?!

1654
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:07,950
Harry, you don't fuck
somebody's patient!

1655
01:06:07,952 --> 01:06:10,219
Fuck you!

1656
01:06:19,097 --> 01:06:20,864
Continue, Mr. Farber.

1657
01:06:20,866 --> 01:06:22,333
Uh...

1658
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:24,069
Uh, er...

1659
01:06:24,071 --> 01:06:25,237
I...

1660
01:06:25,239 --> 01:06:26,372
You lost your thread?

1661
01:06:26,374 --> 01:06:28,941
You were talking
about quitting your job.

1662
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,409
Oh. Right.

1663
01:06:30,411 --> 01:06:31,977
You know...

1664
01:06:31,979 --> 01:06:35,549
Well, I discussed it with my wife.

1665
01:06:35,551 --> 01:06:37,317
While she seems on the surface

1666
01:06:37,319 --> 01:06:38,552
to be supportive,

1667
01:06:38,554 --> 01:06:40,787
I know she'd rather I stay on.

1668
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:42,756
She idolizes Gordon.

1669
01:06:42,758 --> 01:06:44,224
I mean, all the time,

1670
01:06:44,226 --> 01:06:47,228
that's all she does is spend
time with him anyway.

1671
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:51,032
Listen, could you excuse me
just one more second?

1672
01:06:51,034 --> 01:06:51,899
Again?

1673
01:06:51,901 --> 01:06:55,503
I can hear you
from the hallway. Loudly.

1674
01:06:56,572 --> 01:06:58,006
I want you to get out of here.

1675
01:06:58,008 --> 01:07:00,476
I want you to get your
goddamn stuff together,

1676
01:07:00,478 --> 01:07:02,544
and I want you to get out of here!

1677
01:07:02,546 --> 01:07:04,480
You know, I cannot understand

1678
01:07:04,482 --> 01:07:07,182
why the most sophisticated of women

1679
01:07:07,184 --> 01:07:08,751
can't tell the difference

1680
01:07:08,753 --> 01:07:10,053
between a meaningless

1681
01:07:10,055 --> 01:07:11,788
hot, passionate sexual affair

1682
01:07:11,790 --> 01:07:14,558
and a nice, solid,
tranquil, routine marriage.

1683
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,327
Harry, just tell me something.

1684
01:07:16,329 --> 01:07:18,496
Was she the only one,
or were there others?

1685
01:07:18,498 --> 01:07:20,464
No, Amy pollack was the only one.

1686
01:07:20,466 --> 01:07:22,667
May God strike me dead if I'm lying.

1687
01:07:22,669 --> 01:07:23,935
You're an atheist, Harry!

1688
01:07:23,937 --> 01:07:25,971
Yeah. Hey, we're alone in the universe.

1689
01:07:25,973 --> 01:07:28,140
You're gonna blame that on me, too?

1690
01:07:28,142 --> 01:07:29,374
Oh, stop that tap-dancing!

1691
01:07:29,376 --> 01:07:31,977
You... you know,
you turned off me first.

1692
01:07:31,979 --> 01:07:34,280
Oh,<i> please!</i>

1693
01:07:34,282 --> 01:07:35,515
No, I... I gave birth.

1694
01:07:35,517 --> 01:07:37,750
You know, when women give birth,

1695
01:07:37,752 --> 01:07:38,851
there is a time period

1696
01:07:38,853 --> 01:07:41,354
when their hormones
just sort of go crazy.

1697
01:07:41,356 --> 01:07:42,356
Yes, there are...

1698
01:07:42,357 --> 01:07:45,893
Ok, so you're telling me
that you're settling.

1699
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,361
I accept that.

1700
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:48,495
You accept that?

1701
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:51,398
Oh, Harry, you are so fucking nuts!

1702
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,033
Take it easy.

1703
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:55,869
If you're not happy in a marriage,

1704
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:57,806
you don't cheat.

1705
01:07:57,808 --> 01:07:59,774
And with my patient?

1706
01:07:59,776 --> 01:08:02,445
That is a sacred trust. My patient.

1707
01:08:02,447 --> 01:08:04,513
What do you want? Who else do I meet?

1708
01:08:04,515 --> 01:08:06,282
I'm here, I'm working in the room,

1709
01:08:06,284 --> 01:08:08,785
we have the baby,
you're out there practicing,

1710
01:08:08,787 --> 01:08:10,153
we never socialize.

1711
01:08:10,155 --> 01:08:11,321
So now you're blaming me

1712
01:08:11,323 --> 01:08:13,957
because I don't go out
with you enough places

1713
01:08:13,959 --> 01:08:16,860
where you can meet strangers to fuck!

1714
01:08:18,664 --> 01:08:20,565
Look...

1715
01:08:21,066 --> 01:08:23,601
I was merely explaining to you

1716
01:08:23,603 --> 01:08:25,570
why my choice, of necessity,

1717
01:08:25,572 --> 01:08:27,605
is confined to your practice.

1718
01:08:27,607 --> 01:08:30,274
Oh, God. I knew you were mentally ill

1719
01:08:30,276 --> 01:08:31,742
before I married you,

1720
01:08:31,744 --> 01:08:32,978
but I thought, somehow,

1721
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:35,280
because I was a trained professional

1722
01:08:35,282 --> 01:08:36,915
that I could help you.

1723
01:08:36,917 --> 01:08:38,851
Hey. Come on.

1724
01:08:38,853 --> 01:08:40,118
Don't... don't...

1725
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,386
The last thing you wanna do

1726
01:08:41,388 --> 01:08:43,957
is get down on yourself as a therapist.

1727
01:08:43,959 --> 01:08:45,925
Ohh, God!

1728
01:08:45,927 --> 01:08:47,327
I want you to get your shit,

1729
01:08:47,329 --> 01:08:49,330
and I want you to get
your goddamn clothes,

1730
01:08:49,332 --> 01:08:51,832
and I want you to get
the fuck out of here!

1731
01:08:51,834 --> 01:08:54,034
You are the most fucking
irresponsible person

1732
01:08:54,036 --> 01:08:56,938
I've ever seen in my entire life!

1733
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:59,574
And get out!

1734
01:09:01,777 --> 01:09:04,746
Continue, Mr. farber.

1735
01:09:05,481 --> 01:09:06,515
Doctor...

1736
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:10,520
And I mean tonight, motherfucker!

1737
01:09:17,561 --> 01:09:20,230
Dad, my Pepsi.

1738
01:09:26,504 --> 01:09:28,438
So you got even with your ex-wife

1739
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:30,541
and with your sister, and I was born?

1740
01:09:30,543 --> 01:09:32,911
Born? What are you talking about?

1741
01:09:32,913 --> 01:09:34,078
From your pen.

1742
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,447
From your fertile imagination.

1743
01:09:35,449 --> 01:09:36,849
And I mean <i>imagination.</i>

1744
01:09:36,851 --> 01:09:38,717
Hey, I was not trying
to get even with Joan.

1745
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:41,520
Oh, and you created me as
the shrewish Jewish hybrid

1746
01:09:41,522 --> 01:09:43,523
who goes off with another patient,

1747
01:09:43,525 --> 01:09:45,892
an orthodox divorcee from Tel Aviv.

1748
01:09:45,894 --> 01:09:47,961
My sister never should
have married Burt.

1749
01:09:47,963 --> 01:09:50,897
This guy's turned her into a zealot.

1750
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:53,867
It wasn't her fault
your father persecuted you.

1751
01:09:53,869 --> 01:09:55,903
She was fine till
she wound up with him...

1752
01:09:55,905 --> 01:09:58,406
this right-wing hawk
that she's married.

1753
01:09:58,408 --> 01:10:02,043
So she disappointed you
in her choice of husbands?

1754
01:10:02,045 --> 01:10:03,744
Well, fuck you. She loves Burt.

1755
01:10:03,746 --> 01:10:05,112
She was a wonderful kid.

1756
01:10:05,114 --> 01:10:06,515
She had a flair for physics.

1757
01:10:06,517 --> 01:10:08,717
Suddenly overnight, she's kosher.

1758
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:09,918
She loves you still,

1759
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,753
despite your obvious condescension

1760
01:10:11,755 --> 01:10:13,255
towards her life.

1761
01:10:13,257 --> 01:10:16,959
Would you like to hear
what she says about you?

1762
01:10:16,961 --> 01:10:18,194
He's not so bad, Burt.

1763
01:10:18,196 --> 01:10:19,429
He really was a very good brother.

1764
01:10:19,431 --> 01:10:21,965
Just my father <i>did</i> never forgive him

1765
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:23,099
when his wife died.

1766
01:10:23,101 --> 01:10:24,501
The man is not a Jewish man.

1767
01:10:24,503 --> 01:10:26,770
He's not a Jewish man. That's all.

1768
01:10:26,772 --> 01:10:28,305
All right. Poor Harry.

1769
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:29,307
He was always lost.

1770
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:31,443
You know, he could just
never accept the fact

1771
01:10:31,445 --> 01:10:33,912
that there are things you can't know.

1772
01:10:33,914 --> 01:10:37,048
The man is incapable
of an act of faith.

1773
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:38,950
All right. For that, I pity him.

1774
01:10:38,952 --> 01:10:41,252
You know, I would like to hug him again

1775
01:10:41,254 --> 01:10:42,355
like when we were kids.

1776
01:10:42,357 --> 01:10:45,825
And if I was upset,
he was a comfort to me.

1777
01:10:45,827 --> 01:10:47,693
What happens to us?

1778
01:10:47,695 --> 01:10:48,494
Doris...

1779
01:10:48,496 --> 01:10:50,863
She can't hear you.

1780
01:10:51,832 --> 01:10:53,800
And as for Joan...

1781
01:10:53,802 --> 01:10:55,802
Joan? Joan hates me.

1782
01:10:55,804 --> 01:10:57,237
Well, shouldn't she?

1783
01:10:57,239 --> 01:10:58,538
Why should she hate me,

1784
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:00,540
because I was unfaithful to her?

1785
01:11:00,542 --> 01:11:02,342
No, because when she caught you,

1786
01:11:02,344 --> 01:11:03,477
you weren't a man.

1787
01:11:03,479 --> 01:11:05,546
You turned into this double-talking,

1788
01:11:05,548 --> 01:11:08,449
wise-cracking, tap-dancing liar.

1789
01:11:08,451 --> 01:11:10,485
Well, if she had not become so enraged,

1790
01:11:10,487 --> 01:11:12,087
maybe we could've patched things up.

1791
01:11:12,089 --> 01:11:14,089
Listen to this guy. Deluded...

1792
01:11:14,091 --> 01:11:16,458
maybe it tapered a bit
after Hilly was born,

1793
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:18,528
but you two had sex pretty regularly.

1794
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:21,498
I have no idea why
I took up with that patient.

1795
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,400
She was available, she was adorable.

1796
01:11:23,402 --> 01:11:25,535
You know, and my marriage
was droning on.

1797
01:11:25,537 --> 01:11:27,137
Well, what you call "droning on"

1798
01:11:27,139 --> 01:11:31,108
Well, if that's working,
then marriage is not for me.

1799
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:32,443
Well, it's not for everyone.

1800
01:11:32,445 --> 01:11:34,445
Well, you know, but then I get lonely.

1801
01:11:34,447 --> 01:11:36,547
Hey, what do you want me to say?

1802
01:11:36,549 --> 01:11:38,416
She... you know, she gave me Hilly,

1803
01:11:38,418 --> 01:11:40,719
and for that I'm...
I'm eternally grateful

1804
01:11:40,721 --> 01:11:42,388
'cause I love him so much.

1805
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:44,656
You can have any one you want here.

1806
01:11:44,658 --> 01:11:46,125
Can I get 2?

1807
01:11:46,127 --> 01:11:48,994
I'll tell you what,
you can get any 3 presents.

1808
01:11:48,996 --> 01:11:51,764
Go through the store
and pick any 3 presents, ok?

1809
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:52,565
Yeah.

1810
01:11:52,567 --> 01:11:54,300
Look what I found.

1811
01:11:54,302 --> 01:11:57,337
This is the chemistry set
you always wanted.

1812
01:11:57,339 --> 01:11:59,306
Look at that. It's perfect.

1813
01:11:59,308 --> 01:12:01,509
No, no. Don't open it here.

1814
01:12:01,511 --> 01:12:03,144
Let me buy it first.

1815
01:12:03,146 --> 01:12:04,746
Harry?

1816
01:12:04,748 --> 01:12:06,148
Harry!

1817
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:07,616
Hey.

1818
01:12:07,618 --> 01:12:08,750
How you doing?

1819
01:12:08,752 --> 01:12:10,152
Larry, what are you doing here?

1820
01:12:10,154 --> 01:12:11,753
I was buying my nephew a power ranger.

1821
01:12:11,755 --> 01:12:13,688
I can't believe it.
When did you get back?

1822
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:16,192
A couple of days ago. Yeah, it was...

1823
01:12:16,194 --> 01:12:17,194
hey, fay.

1824
01:12:17,195 --> 01:12:19,762
Fay, this is Larry.
I told you about Larry.

1825
01:12:19,764 --> 01:12:21,831
Oh, yeah. It's nice to meet you.

1826
01:12:21,833 --> 01:12:23,766
Old friend, colleague, peer.

1827
01:12:23,768 --> 01:12:24,500
Right.

1828
01:12:24,502 --> 01:12:25,935
So you got back when?

1829
01:12:25,937 --> 01:12:27,236
Uh, 2 days ago. Yeah.

1830
01:12:27,238 --> 01:12:29,239
I took a boat trip down the Amazon.

1831
01:12:29,241 --> 01:12:30,574
Really? God, that sounds exciting.

1832
01:12:30,576 --> 01:12:32,209
Yes, if you don't mind
malaria and dysentery.

1833
01:12:32,211 --> 01:12:34,111
No, butterflies the size of doves.

1834
01:12:34,113 --> 01:12:36,146
Never seen anything like it in my life.

1835
01:12:36,148 --> 01:12:38,549
Yeah, I can live without that, however.

1836
01:12:38,551 --> 01:12:40,051
It was astounding.

1837
01:12:40,053 --> 01:12:41,319
Mmm. It sounds it.

1838
01:12:41,321 --> 01:12:43,054
So you got back 2 days ago?

1839
01:12:43,056 --> 01:12:43,922
2 days ago. Yeah.

1840
01:12:43,924 --> 01:12:45,690
We go back a long way.

1841
01:12:45,692 --> 01:12:48,694
We both started out
wanting to be Kafka,

1842
01:12:48,696 --> 01:12:50,729
and you got slightly closer than me.

1843
01:12:50,731 --> 01:12:53,767
Yeah, I became the insect and he...

1844
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:54,568
Yeah.

1845
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:56,069
Good. I'm amazed.

1846
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:57,071
We should go out.

1847
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:59,306
Yeah. Listen, why don't
you come to my house

1848
01:12:59,308 --> 01:13:01,007
in east Hampton for a weekend?

1849
01:13:01,009 --> 01:13:02,275
It will be great fun.

1850
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:03,778
Well, let's not get hysterical.

1851
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:06,314
No, I'd love to. It would be fun.

1852
01:13:06,316 --> 01:13:07,682
Oh, it's beautiful out there.

1853
01:13:07,684 --> 01:13:09,517
It's sand in the crotch. It's ticks.

1854
01:13:09,519 --> 01:13:12,153
To get this guy to leave
his room, you know...

1855
01:13:12,155 --> 01:13:12,954
Oh, I know.

1856
01:13:12,956 --> 01:13:14,723
He's never had a tan.

1857
01:13:14,725 --> 01:13:17,326
I've always wanted
to learn how to snorkel.

1858
01:13:17,328 --> 01:13:18,594
Oh, well, it's great there.

1859
01:13:18,596 --> 01:13:20,729
Snorkel? Where he lives
there are sharks.

1860
01:13:20,731 --> 01:13:22,064
You see those photographs of guys

1861
01:13:22,066 --> 01:13:24,666
with stumps for legs
and arms? That's what...

1862
01:13:24,668 --> 01:13:26,669
Yes, you are. It's fabulous.

1863
01:13:26,671 --> 01:13:27,937
Let me buy dinner. We'll talk about it.

1864
01:13:27,939 --> 01:13:30,173
No, we'll buy you dinner.
Can we take him to dinner?

1865
01:13:30,175 --> 01:13:32,375
I'd love to tell you about the Amazon.

1866
01:13:32,377 --> 01:13:33,743
'Cause it changed my life.

1867
01:13:33,745 --> 01:13:35,012
I'd love to hear. Sounds amazing.

1868
01:13:35,014 --> 01:13:37,882
I'm gonna write a novel.
I'll tell you about it.

1869
01:13:37,884 --> 01:13:39,050
I'm not into the Amazon.

1870
01:13:39,052 --> 01:13:40,652
You know what the Amazon is?

1871
01:13:40,654 --> 01:13:42,821
This Amazon is the tiny, little heads

1872
01:13:42,823 --> 01:13:44,289
with the lips sewn together.

1873
01:13:44,291 --> 01:13:46,558
Can you picture him this way?

1874
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,661
That's... that's great.
We'll go to dinner tonight.

1875
01:13:49,663 --> 01:13:50,596
Yeah, great.

1876
01:13:50,598 --> 01:13:51,831
That'd be great.

1877
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:53,299
Great. I'm single, available,

1878
01:13:53,301 --> 01:13:55,201
with the soul of a black man.

1879
01:13:55,203 --> 01:13:57,169
I smell sulfur. Do you smell sulfur?

1880
01:13:57,171 --> 01:14:01,107
Hilly, did you open the chemistry set?

1881
01:14:01,109 --> 01:14:02,743
Hey, look. We're almost there.

1882
01:14:02,745 --> 01:14:05,612
Hilly. Hilly, wake up. We're almost...

1883
01:14:05,614 --> 01:14:06,813
Hilly, wake up.

1884
01:14:06,815 --> 01:14:08,348
We're almost at the university.

1885
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:09,650
Your dad's gonna be honored.

1886
01:14:09,652 --> 01:14:11,985
You know, limited as my curriculum was.

1887
01:14:11,987 --> 01:14:13,153
Richard, we're there.

1888
01:14:13,155 --> 01:14:16,057
Hey, honey. Wake up.
We're her... uh-oh.

1889
01:14:16,059 --> 01:14:17,425
Something's wrong.

1890
01:14:17,427 --> 01:14:18,560
What's the matter?

1891
01:14:18,562 --> 01:14:21,262
I don't know. I don't
think he's breathing.

1892
01:14:21,264 --> 01:14:23,065
He's dead. He's dead!

1893
01:14:23,067 --> 01:14:23,832
What?!

1894
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:24,934
I can't believe this.

1895
01:14:24,936 --> 01:14:26,803
I was at the doctor's
with him yesterday.

1896
01:14:26,805 --> 01:14:28,672
They said his heart was fine.

1897
01:14:28,674 --> 01:14:31,641
Oh, gee. There's nothing
to be scared of, Hilly.

1898
01:14:31,643 --> 01:14:32,542
I'm fine, dad.

1899
01:14:32,544 --> 01:14:33,777
Remember I told you

1900
01:14:33,779 --> 01:14:35,312
death is a natural part of life?

1901
01:14:35,314 --> 01:14:37,014
You have to embrace them both.

1902
01:14:37,016 --> 01:14:38,249
What are we gonna do?

1903
01:14:38,251 --> 01:14:40,184
I don't know. Get back in the car.

1904
01:14:40,186 --> 01:14:42,386
I don't wanna sit next to him! Uh-uh.

1905
01:14:42,388 --> 01:14:44,088
Jus... it's over.

1906
01:14:46,758 --> 01:14:48,559
Welcome to adair university, sir.

1907
01:14:48,561 --> 01:14:51,630
We certainly hope
you had a pleasant trip.

1908
01:14:51,632 --> 01:14:53,532
Good to see you. Hello. Hello.

1909
01:14:53,534 --> 01:14:56,101
Would you like
some refreshments, perhaps?

1910
01:14:56,103 --> 01:14:57,569
Is he all right.

1911
01:14:57,571 --> 01:15:00,440
You got one of them rubber bags?

1912
01:15:00,442 --> 01:15:01,274
What? What?

1913
01:15:01,276 --> 01:15:02,675
We've made arrangements

1914
01:15:02,677 --> 01:15:05,278
for the body to be delivered

1915
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,113
to New York City.

1916
01:15:07,115 --> 01:15:12,654
I don't think he has any
immediate family, actually.

1917
01:15:12,656 --> 01:15:13,788
If you prefer,

1918
01:15:13,790 --> 01:15:17,158
we can call off the proceedings.

1919
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,794
I think, probably
that's the best thing.

1920
01:15:19,796 --> 01:15:20,695
No.

1921
01:15:20,697 --> 01:15:21,796
I do. I...

1922
01:15:21,798 --> 01:15:26,002
He'll be all right.
He's here for a purpose.

1923
01:15:27,838 --> 01:15:30,072
You know, I...

1924
01:15:30,074 --> 01:15:31,774
I'll see that...

1925
01:15:31,776 --> 01:15:34,377
That, uh, he's... he's, you know...

1926
01:15:34,379 --> 01:15:36,279
that the funeral comes off.

1927
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:39,716
I'll see that he's buried, uh...

1928
01:15:39,718 --> 01:15:40,484
Properly.

1929
01:15:40,486 --> 01:15:43,320
I understand.

1930
01:15:44,522 --> 01:15:45,522
Underwater.

1931
01:15:45,524 --> 01:15:46,356
Poor Richard.

1932
01:15:46,358 --> 01:15:49,260
Oh, Jesus, I... the poor guy!

1933
01:15:49,262 --> 01:15:50,461
Cookie.

1934
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:52,196
Cookie, cookie...

1935
01:15:52,198 --> 01:15:54,499
I'm not gonna make it. I can't go on.

1936
01:15:54,501 --> 01:15:56,768
Not if you keep drinking
and popping them pills.

1937
01:15:56,770 --> 01:15:58,771
Oh, Jesus. I can't believe this.

1938
01:15:58,773 --> 01:16:00,640
My old school wants to honor me,

1939
01:16:00,642 --> 01:16:03,143
I show up with a hooker
and a dead body.

1940
01:16:03,145 --> 01:16:06,546
You're getting yourself
wound up about nothing.

1941
01:16:06,548 --> 01:16:07,814
Cookie, look at me!

1942
01:16:07,816 --> 01:16:09,416
Look! Look! I'm out of focus!

1943
01:16:09,418 --> 01:16:10,583
What? You look ok to me.

1944
01:16:10,585 --> 01:16:12,853
I mean, a little pale,
but you're all right.

1945
01:16:12,855 --> 01:16:14,522
I'm out of focus. I'm soft.

1946
01:16:14,524 --> 01:16:15,589
You better calm down.

1947
01:16:15,591 --> 01:16:17,858
They're gonna be here
any minute. Calm down.

1948
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:19,160
No, no. It's so humiliating.

1949
01:16:19,162 --> 01:16:21,395
They're gonna honor me, and I'm a blob.

1950
01:16:21,397 --> 01:16:23,165
You look fine. Don't worry.

1951
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:25,167
I'll be sitting on the dais eating.

1952
01:16:25,169 --> 01:16:27,335
They'll get seasick. They'll throw up.

1953
01:16:27,337 --> 01:16:29,204
Hold my hand. Hold my hand.

1954
01:16:29,206 --> 01:16:31,807
You drive all the way
up here with your son

1955
01:16:31,809 --> 01:16:33,041
so he can see you get honored,

1956
01:16:33,043 --> 01:16:35,078
and you're gonna make
an ass out of yourself.

1957
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,512
But don't you see?

1958
01:16:36,514 --> 01:16:37,814
I'm... I'm a huge blur.

1959
01:16:37,816 --> 01:16:39,282
You're gonna be all right.

1960
01:16:39,284 --> 01:16:41,184
Hang in. I'm gonna talk you down.

1961
01:16:41,186 --> 01:16:43,119
Now, I have seen all kinds of guys O.D.

1962
01:16:43,121 --> 01:16:44,787
Heroin, acid, crack. You name it.

1963
01:16:44,789 --> 01:16:46,324
I didn't take any of that stuff.

1964
01:16:46,326 --> 01:16:48,259
Yeah, but you're a pill-popper.

1965
01:16:48,261 --> 01:16:50,762
No, that's not what it is, cookie.

1966
01:16:50,764 --> 01:16:53,498
I'm O.D'ing on myself.
It's that I'm a shit.

1967
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,566
Have some black coffee.

1968
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:56,701
I don't want any coffee.
I don't want anything.

1969
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,368
I'm a shit.

1970
01:16:57,370 --> 01:16:59,105
Talk to me about something.

1971
01:16:59,107 --> 01:17:01,340
Sports? Yeah. I was a pitcher.

1972
01:17:01,342 --> 01:17:03,342
When a guy crowded the plate,

1973
01:17:03,344 --> 01:17:04,643
I used to throw at his head,

1974
01:17:04,645 --> 01:17:06,979
'cause I'm the worst
person in the world.

1975
01:17:06,981 --> 01:17:08,447
Honey, I've seen worse.

1976
01:17:08,449 --> 01:17:10,250
Who? Who's worse than me?

1977
01:17:10,252 --> 01:17:12,719
Yeah, all right. <i>Maybe</i> Hitler.

1978
01:17:12,721 --> 01:17:14,154
Maybe Hitler, Goering, and Goebbels,

1979
01:17:14,156 --> 01:17:16,523
but I'm right fourth,
right behind them.

1980
01:17:16,525 --> 01:17:18,024
Come on, hold my hand.

1981
01:17:18,026 --> 01:17:19,626
Can you feel my hand?

1982
01:17:19,628 --> 01:17:20,527
Yes, it's warm.

1983
01:17:20,529 --> 01:17:22,597
See? It's just panic.

1984
01:17:22,599 --> 01:17:23,798
You're not a blob.

1985
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,100
I know. I'm gonna get over this.

1986
01:17:26,102 --> 01:17:29,003
I'm having a panic attack.
I have these attacks.

1987
01:17:29,005 --> 01:17:30,271
What sports do you like?

1988
01:17:30,273 --> 01:17:32,240
I don't know. I... I like them all.

1989
01:17:32,242 --> 01:17:33,643
I like baseball. I like basketball.

1990
01:17:33,645 --> 01:17:35,812
I was married to a woman,
cookie, who...

1991
01:17:35,814 --> 01:17:37,814
she looked like Max Schmeling.

1992
01:17:37,816 --> 01:17:40,116
No, I'm not joking. She was...

1993
01:17:41,353 --> 01:17:43,052
Uh-oh. All right, it's time.

1994
01:17:43,054 --> 01:17:46,257
I can't get through this
without you. I mean that.

1995
01:17:46,259 --> 01:17:47,725
Don't worry about it. Don't worry.

1996
01:17:47,727 --> 01:17:49,527
If you didn't come with me today...

1997
01:17:49,529 --> 01:17:50,995
Don't worry about it.

1998
01:17:50,997 --> 01:17:52,196
Come on. Straighten up.

1999
01:17:52,198 --> 01:17:55,065
I gotta get a tie. I gotta get my tie.

2000
01:17:55,067 --> 01:17:57,335
All right. Let's go.

2001
01:18:00,139 --> 01:18:04,276
Are you ready to be
immortalized by adair?

2002
01:18:04,278 --> 01:18:05,343
I teach your books.

2003
01:18:05,345 --> 01:18:07,312
These are some of
my literature students.

2004
01:18:07,314 --> 01:18:09,148
Yes, we all know all your work,

2005
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:11,450
your characters...
even the obscure ones.

2006
01:18:11,452 --> 01:18:13,519
No, no. Good reading is a creative act.

2007
01:18:13,521 --> 01:18:14,887
So are you working on anything now?

2008
01:18:14,889 --> 01:18:17,890
Something we can look forward
to sinking our teeth into?

2009
01:18:17,892 --> 01:18:19,792
Actually, I'm in the midst

2010
01:18:19,794 --> 01:18:21,596
of writing a thing on the devil,

2011
01:18:21,598 --> 01:18:24,899
who comes and kidnaps
a man's one true love

2012
01:18:24,901 --> 01:18:26,601
and takes her down to hell,

2013
01:18:26,603 --> 01:18:28,336
and he goes to retrieve her

2014
01:18:28,338 --> 01:18:30,205
and, you know, since it's hell,

2015
01:18:30,207 --> 01:18:32,842
I'm able to settle a lot of old scores.

2016
01:18:32,844 --> 01:18:33,909
Yes.

2017
01:18:33,911 --> 01:18:35,344
Well, what's the man like?

2018
01:18:35,346 --> 01:18:37,379
Uh, it's me thinly disguised.

2019
01:18:37,381 --> 01:18:39,348
In fact, I don't even think

2020
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:41,417
I should disguise it anymore.

2021
01:18:41,419 --> 01:18:43,419
It's, you know, it's me.

2022
01:18:43,421 --> 01:18:44,654
Uh-huh.

2023
01:18:45,490 --> 01:18:46,523
Floor 5.

2024
01:18:46,525 --> 01:18:48,592
Subway muggers, aggressive panhandlers,

2025
01:18:48,594 --> 01:18:50,293
and book critics.

2026
01:18:51,263 --> 01:18:53,797
Right-wing extremists, serial killers,

2027
01:18:53,799 --> 01:18:56,801
lawyers who appear on television.

2028
01:18:57,770 --> 01:18:58,736
Floor 7.

2029
01:18:58,738 --> 01:19:01,806
Sorry that floor is all filled up.

2030
01:19:02,775 --> 01:19:05,710
Escaped war criminals, TV evangelists,

2031
01:19:05,712 --> 01:19:07,311
and the NRA.

2032
01:19:08,182 --> 01:19:09,183
Lowest level.

2033
01:19:09,184 --> 01:19:10,783
Everybody off.

2034
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:42,919
What did you do?

2035
01:19:42,921 --> 01:19:46,355
I invented aluminum siding.

2036
01:19:59,204 --> 01:20:01,339
Harry!

2037
01:20:01,841 --> 01:20:02,841
Dad.

2038
01:20:02,842 --> 01:20:05,209
Get me out of here! This is terrible!

2039
01:20:05,211 --> 01:20:07,880
You know how I could
never stand hot weather.

2040
01:20:07,882 --> 01:20:09,248
What is this man doing here?

2041
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:11,483
He's condemned to eternal suffering.

2042
01:20:11,485 --> 01:20:12,685
Harry, help me.

2043
01:20:12,687 --> 01:20:14,453
I don't understand. What? Why?

2044
01:20:14,455 --> 01:20:16,155
I demand to know the charges.

2045
01:20:16,157 --> 01:20:18,058
"He behaved unconscionably
toward his son,

2046
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:20,527
"accused the boy of
committing a capital crime

2047
01:20:20,529 --> 01:20:21,928
merely by being born."

2048
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:24,831
"Your wife," they told me, "is dead.

2049
01:20:24,833 --> 01:20:26,800
But your son, he's thriving."

2050
01:20:26,802 --> 01:20:30,471
Why did he fight not to be born?

2051
01:20:30,473 --> 01:20:32,306
Look, I forgive him.

2052
01:20:32,308 --> 01:20:35,276
I... you know, what's over is over.

2053
01:20:35,278 --> 01:20:37,778
From... that's... it's...
it's finished.

2054
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:40,247
Look, let him go to heaven, please?

2055
01:20:40,249 --> 01:20:41,415
I'm a Jew.

2056
01:20:41,417 --> 01:20:43,485
We don't believe in heaven.

2057
01:20:43,487 --> 01:20:44,954
Where do you wanna go?

2058
01:20:44,956 --> 01:20:46,522
To a Chinese restaurant.

2059
01:20:46,524 --> 01:20:47,857
Take him to joy luck.

2060
01:20:47,859 --> 01:20:51,661
I love him despite everything.

2061
01:21:11,585 --> 01:21:14,352
Looking for someone?

2062
01:21:15,254 --> 01:21:16,922
I'm here to get fay.

2063
01:21:16,924 --> 01:21:19,158
She's not coming with you.

2064
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:22,028
Because you're the head
of this whole underworld,

2065
01:21:22,030 --> 01:21:24,296
that you can just abduct her
and get away with it?

2066
01:21:24,298 --> 01:21:26,232
Well, I'm gonna kidnap her back.

2067
01:21:26,968 --> 01:21:28,134
What are you laughing?

2068
01:21:28,136 --> 01:21:30,670
You dare to match your
powers against mine?

2069
01:21:30,672 --> 01:21:32,306
You wanna know why?

2070
01:21:32,308 --> 01:21:33,741
Yeah, I do.

2071
01:21:33,743 --> 01:21:34,442
I'm sorry.

2072
01:21:34,444 --> 01:21:36,277
Forgive me for laughing.

2073
01:21:36,279 --> 01:21:36,911
Why?

2074
01:21:36,913 --> 01:21:39,981
I'm more powerful than you

2075
01:21:39,983 --> 01:21:41,850
because I'm a bigger sinner.

2076
01:21:41,852 --> 01:21:44,019
Because you're a fallen angel,

2077
01:21:44,021 --> 01:21:46,388
and I never believed in God

2078
01:21:46,390 --> 01:21:47,990
or heaven or any of that stuff.

2079
01:21:47,992 --> 01:21:49,858
I'm strictly, you know,

2080
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:52,395
quarks and particles
and black hole, you know.

2081
01:21:52,397 --> 01:21:54,764
All the other stuff is junk to me.

2082
01:21:54,766 --> 01:21:57,600
And also I do terrible things.

2083
01:21:57,602 --> 01:21:59,269
I've cheated on all my wives,

2084
01:21:59,271 --> 01:22:01,071
and none of 'em deserved it.

2085
01:22:01,073 --> 01:22:02,605
I sleep with whores,

2086
01:22:02,607 --> 01:22:04,642
I drink too much,

2087
01:22:04,644 --> 01:22:06,911
I take pills and I lie

2088
01:22:06,913 --> 01:22:08,412
and I'm vain, I'm cowardly

2089
01:22:08,414 --> 01:22:11,148
and prone to violence, you know.

2090
01:22:11,150 --> 01:22:15,019
I once almost ran over
a book critic with my car,

2091
01:22:15,021 --> 01:22:16,822
but swerved at the last second.

2092
01:22:16,824 --> 01:22:18,657
Did you ever have 2 women at once?

2093
01:22:18,659 --> 01:22:20,827
Yes, I did have 2 women at once.

2094
01:22:20,829 --> 01:22:21,861
And I'll tell you something else.

2095
01:22:21,863 --> 01:22:23,796
I didn't care that it was exploitive.

2096
01:22:23,798 --> 01:22:25,298
And I'll tell you something else.

2097
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:26,466
They were sisters.

2098
01:22:26,468 --> 01:22:27,333
Really?

2099
01:22:27,335 --> 01:22:28,336
Yes. Absolutely.

2100
01:22:28,337 --> 01:22:29,970
2 blond wasp sisters.

2101
01:22:29,972 --> 01:22:31,038
Not the Sherman twins?

2102
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,774
Yes, the Sherman twins. Exactly.

2103
01:22:33,776 --> 01:22:34,741
You... you...

2104
01:22:34,743 --> 01:22:35,442
They're here.

2105
01:22:35,444 --> 01:22:37,644
The Sherman twins are here.

2106
01:22:37,646 --> 01:22:40,315
So, do you know Sandra Pepkin?

2107
01:22:40,317 --> 01:22:41,317
Do I know Sandra Pepkin?

2108
01:22:41,318 --> 01:22:42,984
Only the best blow job in the hadasa.

2109
01:22:42,986 --> 01:22:45,286
So if you know Sandra Pepkin,

2110
01:22:45,288 --> 01:22:47,622
I fucked her best friend,

2111
01:22:47,624 --> 01:22:48,556
the cripple, Pearl.

2112
01:22:48,558 --> 01:22:49,924
Oh, Pearl in the wheelchair.

2113
01:22:49,926 --> 01:22:51,060
Pearl in the wheelchair.

2114
01:22:51,062 --> 01:22:53,796
Speaking of handicaps,
do you know Marie Taylor?

2115
01:22:53,798 --> 01:22:54,630
Well, yes,

2116
01:22:54,632 --> 01:22:56,065
but Marie Taylor I don't count.

2117
01:22:56,067 --> 01:22:57,233
Marie Taylor's dyslexic.

2118
01:22:57,235 --> 01:22:59,735
She put her Tampax in her nose.

2119
01:22:59,737 --> 01:23:00,936
You ever fuck a blind girl?

2120
01:23:00,938 --> 01:23:02,839
No, that I never did. Did you?

2121
01:23:02,841 --> 01:23:05,976
Ooh. They're so grateful.

2122
01:23:05,978 --> 01:23:07,377
Would you like a drink?

2123
01:23:07,379 --> 01:23:09,847
Could I get some Tequila?

2124
01:23:09,849 --> 01:23:11,015
Sure, sure, I got great Tequila.

2125
01:23:11,017 --> 01:23:12,917
Why don't you sit down?
Make yourself at home.

2126
01:23:12,919 --> 01:23:14,686
You want me to turn on
the air conditioner?

2127
01:23:14,688 --> 01:23:15,888
You're air conditioned here?

2128
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:18,056
Sure. It fucks up the ozone layer.

2129
01:23:18,058 --> 01:23:20,792
I could be very comfortable down here.

2130
01:23:20,794 --> 01:23:22,261
I'll tell you something, Harry.

2131
01:23:22,263 --> 01:23:23,929
I love it. I love it here.

2132
01:23:23,931 --> 01:23:25,664
I wouldn't be anyplace else.

2133
01:23:25,666 --> 01:23:29,435
You know, I've been offered
a lot of jobs in your world,

2134
01:23:29,437 --> 01:23:31,504
but why should I be an employee?

2135
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:33,740
Here I'm my own boss, and I'm free.

2136
01:23:33,742 --> 01:23:35,275
What kind of jobs did they offer you?

2137
01:23:35,277 --> 01:23:37,076
For 2 years I ran a Hollywood studio,

2138
01:23:37,078 --> 01:23:39,680
but you can't trust those people.

2139
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:40,548
I agree with you.

2140
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:41,882
Better to rule down here

2141
01:23:41,884 --> 01:23:43,517
than to serve in heaven, right?

2142
01:23:43,519 --> 01:23:44,785
That's Milton, I think.

2143
01:23:44,787 --> 01:23:47,288
To evil. It keeps things humming.

2144
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:48,255
Oh, jeez.

2145
01:23:48,257 --> 01:23:50,425
So you kidnapped fay, huh?

2146
01:23:50,427 --> 01:23:51,226
Yes, I did.

2147
01:23:51,228 --> 01:23:52,794
But some women are turned on

2148
01:23:52,796 --> 01:23:54,095
by aggressive, assertive behavior.

2149
01:23:54,097 --> 01:23:56,899
Yeah, so if I suddenly
kidnapped her back?

2150
01:23:56,901 --> 01:23:58,267
You kidnap?

2151
01:23:58,269 --> 01:23:59,101
No, it's not your style.

2152
01:23:59,103 --> 01:24:01,571
You're not a fun guy. Too serious.

2153
01:24:01,573 --> 01:24:02,506
Fay knew that.

2154
01:24:02,508 --> 01:24:03,574
You're too angry at life.

2155
01:24:03,576 --> 01:24:05,475
I got a lot to be angry at.

2156
01:24:05,477 --> 01:24:09,413
But sooner or later, Harry,
you gotta back off.

2157
01:24:09,415 --> 01:24:10,280
It's like Vegas.

2158
01:24:10,282 --> 01:24:11,682
You're up, you're down,

2159
01:24:11,684 --> 01:24:14,619
but in the end, the house always wins.

2160
01:24:14,621 --> 01:24:16,588
Doesn't mean you didn't have fun.

2161
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:20,291
Now, one thing you are not
is a kidnapper.

2162
01:24:20,293 --> 01:24:21,893
Kidnapper!

2163
01:24:21,895 --> 01:24:23,895
Listen to me!

2164
01:24:23,897 --> 01:24:25,297
Get out of my way!

2165
01:24:25,299 --> 01:24:26,565
Can't you see you're walking

2166
01:24:26,567 --> 01:24:27,800
with a fucking kidnapper?

2167
01:24:27,802 --> 01:24:30,536
You'll have to come with me, sir.

2168
01:24:30,538 --> 01:24:32,371
You're under arrest.

2169
01:24:32,373 --> 01:24:36,275
I gotta put the cuffs on you.

2170
01:24:36,277 --> 01:24:37,844
You stay over there.

2171
01:24:37,846 --> 01:24:40,880
How can I kidnap my own son?

2172
01:24:40,882 --> 01:24:43,784
Hey, we got drugs in the bag.

2173
01:24:43,786 --> 01:24:47,021
Let me go, bitch! Just let me go!

2174
01:24:47,023 --> 01:24:48,890
Get off of me, bitch!

2175
01:24:48,892 --> 01:24:50,926
Get her in the car.

2176
01:24:50,928 --> 01:24:53,829
Can't I be honored and then arrested?

2177
01:24:53,831 --> 01:24:56,999
No, we can't do that. I'm sorry.

2178
01:24:57,001 --> 01:25:02,438
Prostitute in your car
in possession of marijuana.

2179
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:05,041
Possession of an unlicensed firearm.

2180
01:25:05,043 --> 01:25:07,143
I told you already about the firearm.

2181
01:25:07,145 --> 01:25:08,978
There was a crazy woman on my roof

2182
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:09,846
shooting at me.

2183
01:25:09,848 --> 01:25:11,214
I got the gun away from her.

2184
01:25:11,216 --> 01:25:12,349
I put it in my car.

2185
01:25:12,351 --> 01:25:13,550
I was gonna hand it in.

2186
01:25:13,552 --> 01:25:15,452
I gotta make another phone call.

2187
01:25:15,454 --> 01:25:17,788
Yeah, I know, but that didn't count.

2188
01:25:17,790 --> 01:25:19,156
That was to my girlfriend's

2189
01:25:19,158 --> 01:25:21,659
I'm trying to keep her
from getting married.

2190
01:25:21,661 --> 01:25:23,494
You also called your sister.

2191
01:25:23,496 --> 01:25:25,297
Yeah. My sister wasn't in.

2192
01:25:25,299 --> 01:25:26,299
You called your lawyer.

2193
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:28,133
My lawyer was at canyon ranch.

2194
01:25:28,135 --> 01:25:29,634
I can never get my lawyer.

2195
01:25:29,636 --> 01:25:32,104
Can I give you some advice?

2196
01:25:32,106 --> 01:25:35,141
You're in deep shit.

2197
01:25:41,949 --> 01:25:46,086
This time, I think
you've really had it.

2198
01:25:46,088 --> 01:25:49,590
Hey, it was your idea to kidnap Hilly.

2199
01:25:49,592 --> 01:25:51,526
It was my idea? It wasn't my idea.

2200
01:25:51,528 --> 01:25:54,729
You don't have to act
out on every impulse.

2201
01:25:54,731 --> 01:25:56,698
You've got to tell me the truth.

2202
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:57,999
Is it better being dead?

2203
01:25:58,001 --> 01:25:58,900
Is it better?

2204
01:25:58,902 --> 01:26:00,002
No, it's not really,

2205
01:26:00,004 --> 01:26:01,370
but there's one good thing.

2206
01:26:01,372 --> 01:26:03,405
You don't get called for jury duty,

2207
01:26:03,407 --> 01:26:05,374
but then you have no options.

2208
01:26:05,376 --> 01:26:06,608
It's not for you.

2209
01:26:06,610 --> 01:26:08,677
Jesus. I'm no good at life.

2210
01:26:08,679 --> 01:26:10,713
No, no, but you write well.

2211
01:26:10,715 --> 01:26:12,449
I write well, but that's
a different story

2212
01:26:12,451 --> 01:26:14,951
because I can manipulate
the characters and plots.

2213
01:26:14,953 --> 01:26:16,386
Right. You create your own universe,

2214
01:26:16,388 --> 01:26:18,789
but that's much nicer
than the world we have.

2215
01:26:18,791 --> 01:26:21,525
But I can't function
in the world we have.

2216
01:26:21,527 --> 01:26:23,061
I'm a failure at life.

2217
01:26:23,063 --> 01:26:23,795
I don't know.

2218
01:26:23,797 --> 01:26:24,896
I think you bring pleasure

2219
01:26:24,898 --> 01:26:26,798
to a lot of people. That's good.

2220
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,134
Yeah, but even that's drying up.

2221
01:26:29,136 --> 01:26:30,969
For the last months,

2222
01:26:30,971 --> 01:26:32,171
I haven't been able to come up

2223
01:26:32,172 --> 01:26:35,208
with a meaningful idea to write.

2224
01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:38,444
Well, make peace with your demons,

2225
01:26:38,446 --> 01:26:40,012
and your block will pass.

2226
01:26:40,014 --> 01:26:41,914
Jesus, it sounds so trite,

2227
01:26:41,916 --> 01:26:44,417
but I just want to be happy.

2228
01:26:44,419 --> 01:26:47,287
To be alive is to be happy.

2229
01:26:47,289 --> 01:26:49,523
Take it from me.

2230
01:26:50,158 --> 01:26:51,225
Hey, block.

2231
01:26:51,227 --> 01:26:53,727
Come on.

2232
01:26:56,097 --> 01:26:58,666
Some people just put up your bail.

2233
01:26:58,668 --> 01:26:59,401
My bail?

2234
01:26:59,403 --> 01:27:02,137
That's right. This way.

2235
01:27:02,139 --> 01:27:05,306
Yeah. We got the message
on our service.

2236
01:27:05,308 --> 01:27:07,309
Came right from our wedding.

2237
01:27:07,311 --> 01:27:08,911
You did?

2238
01:27:08,913 --> 01:27:10,747
Yeah, we were on our way
to our honeymoon.

2239
01:27:10,749 --> 01:27:13,150
You got married?

2240
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:13,917
Yeah.

2241
01:27:13,919 --> 01:27:15,085
I can't believe it.

2242
01:27:15,087 --> 01:27:17,854
In the end, you chose him over me?

2243
01:27:17,856 --> 01:27:20,557
You're gonna insult me
after we ran from the altar

2244
01:27:20,559 --> 01:27:23,161
to keep you from rotting
in some prison.

2245
01:27:23,163 --> 01:27:24,429
I know you get claustrophobic.

2246
01:27:24,431 --> 01:27:25,930
Plus you're the perfect punk.

2247
01:27:25,932 --> 01:27:26,764
You'll get buggered

2248
01:27:26,766 --> 01:27:27,765
by every con in the cell block.

2249
01:27:27,767 --> 01:27:30,034
You're the guy that should be in there

2250
01:27:30,036 --> 01:27:32,270
because you stole her
from under my nose.

2251
01:27:32,272 --> 01:27:34,873
Harry, he didn't steal me.

2252
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:36,108
I love him.

2253
01:27:36,110 --> 01:27:37,743
I can't fathom this.

2254
01:27:37,745 --> 01:27:41,013
I appreciate your coming,
but I can't...

2255
01:27:41,015 --> 01:27:43,148
why? Why not me?

2256
01:27:43,150 --> 01:27:44,716
You told me that I wasn't supposed

2257
01:27:44,718 --> 01:27:46,052
to fall in love with you,

2258
01:27:46,054 --> 01:27:48,154
How could you listen to me?

2259
01:27:48,156 --> 01:27:49,355
You know how crazy I am.

2260
01:27:49,357 --> 01:27:52,125
Well, you were my mentor, that's why.

2261
01:27:52,127 --> 01:27:53,960
But you were sleeping with your mentor.

2262
01:27:53,962 --> 01:27:57,098
So? I've slept with my gynecologist.

2263
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:59,935
What has that got to do with anything?

2264
01:27:59,937 --> 01:28:02,537
You're gonna snorkel
down the Amazon with him

2265
01:28:02,539 --> 01:28:03,738
when you could have me?

2266
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:06,508
I will never be the writer you are.

2267
01:28:06,510 --> 01:28:09,045
You put your art into your work.

2268
01:28:09,047 --> 01:28:10,613
I put it into my life.

2269
01:28:10,615 --> 01:28:12,615
I can make her happier.

2270
01:28:12,617 --> 01:28:13,749
I love you.

2271
01:28:13,751 --> 01:28:14,417
So...

2272
01:28:14,419 --> 01:28:15,918
I do, I do. It's just that

2273
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:19,188
I'm in love with Larry.

2274
01:28:19,190 --> 01:28:20,624
I'm his wife.

2275
01:28:20,626 --> 01:28:22,659
I love you, too, Harry. Now, please,

2276
01:28:22,661 --> 01:28:26,129
so that we can go
and enjoy our honeymoon.

2277
01:28:26,131 --> 01:28:27,498
We'll be in Santa Fe about a month,

2278
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:30,133
and when we come back,
we'll all go out.

2279
01:28:30,135 --> 01:28:32,403
This is where you're going
on your honeymoon?

2280
01:28:32,405 --> 01:28:34,038
He's taking you to the desert?

2281
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:37,876
Sand? The desert is cactus.

2282
01:28:37,878 --> 01:28:39,244
It's Gila monsters,

2283
01:28:39,246 --> 01:28:42,448
whatever you call them,
lizards, is the desert.

2284
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:45,585
Harry, give us your blessing, please?

2285
01:28:45,587 --> 01:28:46,720
Give 'em your blessings

2286
01:28:46,722 --> 01:28:49,856
before I throw you back
in that fucking jail cell

2287
01:28:49,858 --> 01:28:52,592
and I bugger you.

2288
01:28:52,594 --> 01:28:53,960
God.

2289
01:28:53,962 --> 01:28:55,195
I don't know what to say.

2290
01:28:55,197 --> 01:28:56,631
I love you.

2291
01:28:56,633 --> 01:28:59,967
This guy I've loved...

2292
01:28:59,969 --> 01:29:01,736
Uh...

2293
01:29:01,738 --> 01:29:05,873
I give up. I give up.

2294
01:29:06,275 --> 01:29:09,144
We'll get you home, all right?

2295
01:29:09,146 --> 01:29:10,747
Santa Fe, you're gonna take her?

2296
01:29:10,749 --> 01:29:12,382
Tacos.

2297
01:29:34,476 --> 01:29:37,605
Harry, what about
the honoring ceremony?

2298
01:29:40,683 --> 01:29:42,447
We haven't had the ceremony.

2299
01:29:42,484 --> 01:29:44,385
The police interrupted.

2300
01:29:46,122 --> 01:29:47,817
What, am I dreaming?

2301
01:29:47,891 --> 01:29:49,017
Everybody dreams.

2302
01:29:49,092 --> 01:29:50,560
Come on.

2303
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:52,494
Professor Clark has everything planned.

2304
01:29:54,397 --> 01:29:56,890
Can I bring Hilly?

2305
01:29:56,934 --> 01:29:59,232
Well, it's your dream.

2306
01:30:00,538 --> 01:30:02,199
Mm?

2307
01:30:02,306 --> 01:30:04,832
Everyone is waiting to honor you.

2308
01:30:04,909 --> 01:30:08,107
After all, you created them.

2309
01:31:14,918 --> 01:31:16,978
I love all of you.

2310
01:31:17,021 --> 01:31:18,546
Really, you've given me...

2311
01:31:18,623 --> 01:31:20,955
some of the happiest moments
of my life...

2312
01:31:21,025 --> 01:31:24,620
and you've even saved my life at times.

2313
01:31:24,662 --> 01:31:27,825
And now you've actually
taught me things...

2314
01:31:27,865 --> 01:31:29,265
and I'm completely grateful--

2315
01:31:29,334 --> 01:31:32,304
I think the author's message
is to know yourself...

2316
01:31:32,337 --> 01:31:34,999
stop kidding yourself,
accept your limitations...

2317
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,508
and get on with your life.

2318
01:31:36,542 --> 01:31:37,703
It's amazing.

2319
01:31:37,743 --> 01:31:41,180
To me, it's a really interesting
character--

2320
01:31:41,247 --> 01:31:44,740
a guy who can't function well
in life...

2321
01:31:44,784 --> 01:31:48,345
but can only function in art.

2322
01:31:48,388 --> 01:31:51,688
It's sort of sad in a way
and also funny.

2323
01:31:51,758 --> 01:31:54,751
But your books all seem
a little sad on the surface...

2324
01:31:54,795 --> 01:31:56,263
which is why I like
deconstructing them...

2325
01:31:56,297 --> 01:31:58,664
because underneath
they're really happy.

2326
01:31:58,699 --> 01:31:59,996
It's just that you don't know it.

2327
01:32:02,203 --> 01:32:04,298
I feel like I'm in a dream.

2328
01:32:04,339 --> 01:32:08,242
This, for me, is the best dream
I've had in months.

2329
01:32:08,310 --> 01:32:10,836
The happiest dream--

2330
01:32:10,912 --> 01:32:12,607
Oh, I like it.

2331
01:32:12,647 --> 01:32:14,308
I like it.

2332
01:32:14,416 --> 01:32:19,719
A character who's too neurotic
to function in life...

2333
01:32:19,756 --> 01:32:23,056
who can only function in art.

2334
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:26,628
Notes for a novel.

2335
01:32:27,363 --> 01:32:28,763
Opening possibility:

2336
01:32:29,967 --> 01:32:34,768
Rifken led a fragmented,
disjointed existence.

2337
01:32:34,838 --> 01:32:37,239
He had long ago come
to this conclusion...

2338
01:32:37,274 --> 01:32:39,972
all people know the same truth.

2339
01:32:40,044 --> 01:32:43,947
Our lives consist
of how we choose to distort it.

2340
01:32:43,982 --> 01:32:47,247
Only his writing was calm.

2341
01:32:47,285 --> 01:32:51,223
His writing, which had
in more ways than one...

2342
01:32:51,257 --> 01:32:53,055
saved his life.
