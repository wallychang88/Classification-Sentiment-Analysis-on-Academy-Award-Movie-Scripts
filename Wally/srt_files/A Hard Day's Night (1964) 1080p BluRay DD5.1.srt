46
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,690
Hey, pardon me for askin',
but who's that little old man?

47
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,530
- What little old man?
- That little old man.

48
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,400
Oh, that one.
That's my grandfather.

49
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,570
- Your grandfather?
- Yeah.

50
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,160
- That's not your grandfather.
- It is, you know.

51
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,910
But I've seen your grandfather.
He lives in your house.

52
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,210
Oh, that's my other grandfather,
but he's my grandfather as well.

53
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,750
How do you reckon that one out?

54
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,590
Well, everyone's entitled
to two, aren't they?

55
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,750
And this is my other one.

56
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,670
We know that,
but what's he doin' here?

57
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,880
Well, my mother thought
the trip would do him good.

58
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,970
- How's that?
- He's nursin' a broken heart.

59
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,180
JOHN:
Ah, poor old thing.

60
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,640
Hey, mister,
are you nursin' a broken heart?

61
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,270
He's a nice old man, isn't he?

62
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,320
He's very clean.

63
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,120
- Hello, grandfather.
- Hello.

64
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,540
He can talk then, can he?

65
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,700
Of course he can talk.
He's a human being, isn't he?

66
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,210
Well, if he's your grandfather,
who knows? Ha ha ha.

67
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,590
And we're lookin' after him,
are we?

68
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,630
- I look after meself.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

69
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,920
He's got you worried, then?

70
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,880
Him, he's a villain,
a real mixer...

71
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,140
and he costs you a fortune
in breach of promise cases.

72
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,930
- GEORGE: Get on.
- No, straight up.

73
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,180
Hiya.

74
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,390
- Hello, Shake.
- Hello, Shake.

75
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,730
- You got on all right, then?
- No.

76
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,110
Oh? Well, we're here.

77
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,770
SHAKE: Norm'll be along
in a minute with the tickets.

78
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,820
Hey, who's the little old man?

79
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,400
It's Paul's grandfather.

80
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,450
- Oh, aye, but I thought...
- No, that's his other one.

81
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,450
Oh, that's all right, then.

82
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,250
Clean, though, isn't he?

83
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,080
Oh, aye. He's very clean.

84
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,210
- NORM: Mornin', lads.
- Hi, Norm.

85
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,630
Thank God you've all got here.
Look, I've had a marvelous idea.

86
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,470
Just for once,
let's all try to behave...

87
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,470
like ordinary
respectable citizens.

88
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,800
Let's not cause any trouble,
pull any strokes...

89
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,720
or do anything
I'm gonna be sorry for...

90
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,350
especially tomorrow in that
television theater, because...

91
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,100
Are you listening to me,
Lennon?

92
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,100
You're a swine.
Isn't he, George?

93
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,650
Yeah, a swine.

94
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,530
Thanks. Hey!

95
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,740
ALL:
Who's that little old man?

96
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,160
- Well, who is he?
- He belongs to Paul.

97
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,410
Oh, well. I'm going down
for a cup of coffee.

98
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,200
- Anyone coming?
- We'll follow you down.

99
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,660
I want me coffee.

100
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,580
You can come with Shake and me,
if you like.

101
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,170
PAUL: Look after him. I don't
want to find you've lost him.

102
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:35,840
Don't be cheeky. I'll bind him
to me with promises.

103
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,930
Very clean, isn't he?
Come out, granddad.

104
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,350
Make up your mind, will you?

105
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,870
Hello. Morning.

106
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,710
All right?

107
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,140
Whoa.

108
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,890
Do you mind if we have it open?

109
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,390
Yes, I do.

110
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,310
Well, there are four of us,
and we'd like it open...

111
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,070
not if it's
all the same to you, that is.

112
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:41,200
It isn't. I travel
on this train regularly...

113
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,530
twice a week, so I suppose
I have some rights.

114
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,910
So have we.

115
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,920
[Playing rock and roll]

116
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,500
And we'll have that thing
off as well. Thank you.

117
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,000
- [Turns off]
- But...

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,840
An elementary knowledge
of the Railway Acts...

119
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,510
would tell you that I am
perfectly within my rights.

120
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,760
Yeah, but we want to hear it.
There's more of us than you.

121
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,930
We're a community,
a majority vote.

122
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,220
Up the workers
and all that stuff.

123
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,010
Then I suggest
you take that damn thing...

124
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,270
into the corridor, or
some other part of the train...

125
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,140
where you obviously belong.

126
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,600
Give us a kiss.

127
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,020
Look, mister, we paid
for our seats, too, you know.

128
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,900
I travel on this train
regularly, twice a week.

129
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,740
Knock it off, Paul.
You can't win with his sort.

130
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,400
After all, it's his train,
isn't it, mister?

131
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,610
And don't take that tone
with me, young man.

132
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,490
I fought the war for your sort.

133
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,990
I bet you're sorry you won.

134
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,790
- I shall call the guard.
- Ah, but what?

135
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,910
They don't take kindly
to insults, you know.

136
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:37,460

and leave the kennel to Lassie.

can we have our ball back?

Can we have our ball back?

- JOHN: Hey!
- PAUL: Please, mister!

141
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,280
- You want to watch it.
- Well, it's not my fault.

142
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,530
You stick to that story, son.

143
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,070
I can't help it.
I'm just taller than you are.

144
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,530
They always say that.

145
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,990
Well, I've got me eye on ya.

146
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,700
I'm sorry, Norm. I can't help
being taller than you.

147
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,500
Well, don't rub it in! I've
a good mind to thump you, Shake.

148
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,120
If you're gonna have a barney,
can I hold your coat?

149
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,790
- He started it.
- I did not. You did.

150
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,960
Well, what happened?

151
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,130
The old fella said that...

152
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,500
could he have these pictures,
and Norm said, "No."

153
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,880
And all I said was,
"Well, why not be big about it?"

154
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,970
- And?
- Your grandfather pointed out...

155
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,720
that Shake was always being
taller than me just to spite me.

156
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,220
I knew it. He started it.

157
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,890
- PAUL: I should've known.
- NORM: You what?

158
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,100
You two have never had
an argument in your life...

159
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,230
and in two minutes flat,
he's got you at it.

160
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,600
He's a king mixer.

161
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,520
He hates group unity,
so he gets everyone at it.

162
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,480
Well, I suggest
you just give him the photos...

163
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,650
and have done with it.

164
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,240
Oh, all right, you old devil.
Here you are.

165
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,780

sign one of them for us?

166

JOHN: Hey, look at the talent.
Let's give 'em a pull.

168
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,300
- Should I?
- Aye, but don't rush.

169
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,010
None of your five bar gate

00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:52,190
Ringo,
look after him, will you?

1025
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:55,400
- Oh, hey, Norm.
- Do I have to raise my voice?

1026
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,570
All right. Come on, granddad.

1027
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:01,110
I'm a drummer,
not a wet nurse, you know.

1028
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,890
GRANDFATHER:
Would you look at him...

1029
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:29,180
sitting there with his hooter
scraping away at that book.

1030
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,560
Well, what's the matter
with that?

1031
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:34,270
Have you no natural resources
of your own?

1032
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:36,190
Have they even robbed you
of that?

1033
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:39,740
- You can learn from books.
- You can, can you?

1034
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:42,110
Ahh. Sheeps' heads.

1035
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,280
You could learn more by
getting out there and living.

1036
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:47,080
- Out where?
- Any old where.

1037
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:50,330
But not our little Richard.
Oh, no.

1038
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:52,250
When you're not thumping
them pagan skins...

1039
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:54,880
you're tormenting your eyes
with that rubbish.

1040
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,170
- Books are good.
- Parading's better.

1041
00:56:58,170 --> 00:56:59,920
Parading?

1042
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,760
Parading the streets...

1043
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,260
trailing your coat,
bowling along... living!

1044
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:10,020
- Well, I am living.
- You? Living?

1045
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,600
When was the last time
you gave a girl...

1046
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,980
a pink-edged daisy?

1047
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,190
When did you last
embarrass a Sheila...

1048
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:20,030
with your cool
appraising stare?

1049
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:22,280
You're a bit old for
that sort of chat, aren't you?

1050
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,530
Well, at least
I've got a backlog of memories.

1051
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:27,160
All you've got is that book.

1052
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,580
Ah, stop picking on me. You're
as bad as the rest of them.

1053
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:32,200
Ah, so you are a man
after all.

1054
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,040
What's that mean?

1055
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,120
Do you think I haven't noticed?

1056
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:39,170
Do you think I wasn't aware
of the drift?

1057
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:41,380
You poor, unfortunate scruff.

1058
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:44,970
They've driven you
into books...

1059
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:46,890
with their cruel,
unnatural treatment...

1060
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:49,300
exploiting your good nature.

1061
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,720
I don't know.

1062
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:54,390
Ah, that lot's never happier
unless they're jeering you.

1063
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:55,560
And where would they be...

1064
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,810
without the steady support
of your drum beat?

1065
00:57:57,810 --> 00:57:59,440
That's what I'd like to know.

1066
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,900
Yeah. That's right.

1067
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:05,610
And what's it all come to
in the end?

1068
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:07,990
Yeah.
What's in it for me?

1069
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:09,120
A book.

1070
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,990
Yeah, a bloomin' book.

1071
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:13,370
When you could be out there...

1072
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:15,210
betraying
a rich American widow...

1073
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:19,630
or sipping palm wine in Tahiti
before you're too old like me.

1074
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:22,880
Yeah, funny, really,
'cause I never thought...

1075
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,210
but being
middle-aged and old...

1076
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:25,630
takes up most of your time,
doesn't it?

1077
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:27,680
You're only right.

1078
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:32,010
Where are you going?

1079
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:34,470
I'm going parading
before it's too late.

1080

Hey, Ringo, you know
what just happened to me?

1081
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:48,280
No, I don't.

1082
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:51,660
You ought to stop
looking so scornful.

1083
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,160
It's twisting your face.

1084
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,330
Tell him of the story about...

1085
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:58,500
Hello, here he is,

1086

looking after the old man.

We've only got half an hour
to the final run-through.

1088

He can't walk out on us now.

1089
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,180
Can't he?
He's done it, son.

1090

- Hey, you know what happened?
- We know.

He's stirred him up.

He hasn't.

1093
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:16,560
Yeah, he... he filled his head
with notions seemingly.

we'll have to put him right.
