647
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,575
See, your feet
are too open, Randy.

648
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,602
Nice and natural.

649
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,095
Yes! Go! All right!

650
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,415
Give me five! Good
putt, son, good putt.

651
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,615
Did you see that, Randy?
That's the way to do it!

652
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,926
All right.

653
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,207
Birdie putt.

654
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,762
God damn it.
Son of a bitch.

655
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,528
Get my clubs, would you?
Get the ball.

656
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,969

Samantha, I think
I heard your dad pull up.

660
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,375
All right.

661
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,890
You guys finish your chores?

662
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,411
Not quite.

663
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,210
Just about.

664
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,935
How about the dusting, Sam?

665
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,610
I haven't done that yet.

666
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,604
Well, I saw you working
on your art project.

667
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,775
You had time to finish
your little art project,

668
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,529
but you didn't have time
to finish your chores?

669
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,775
I thought we talked about that.

670
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,335
Dad, it's fine,
I can finish the dusting.

671
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,455
No, it's not fine, Mindy.

672
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,055
You have your own chores to
do and Sam has hers to do.

673
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,844
Huh? It's simple.

674
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,731
Poor choice there, Sam.
And hurry up.

675
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,561

676
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,970

You guys aren't setting
any speed records, are you?

678
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,641
What'd you do, get about half done?
Hey, hey, hey.

679
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,335
So, did you finish?

680
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,361
No.

681
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,049
Is the job complete?

682
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,486
So, what are you
gonna be doing tomorrow?

683
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,681

684
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,564
Yeah.
Okay. Go.

you understand?
Tomorrow?

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,081
Okay.

700
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,095
Thank you. I just wanted
you to back me up on that

00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,175
so I'm not the only one
yelling at them all the time.

Okay, I back you up.
You guys got that?

703
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,415
We all agree, everybody agrees, right?
Tomorrow, chores?

704
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,966
They don't hear it. Goes in
one ear and out the other.

705
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,255
But, Dad, I mean,
dusting is pointless.

706
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,203
It's not pointless,
you just don't like to do it.

707
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,842
But, I mean, who dusts anymore?

708
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,048
You do when we ask you to!

709
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,455

what sculpture are you making?

01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,295
Yes.

1297
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,735
What's the one thing
you know about

1298
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,120
Sarah Palin's
17-year-old daughter?

1299
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,770
She's pregnant?
That's right.

1300
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:08,655
And what is the one thing
that you are not going to be

1301
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,921
in a couple of years
when you turn 17?

1302
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,722
Pregnant?
That's right!

1303
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,524
All right, now,
what are the two ways

1304
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:16,926
that you can achieve that goal?

1305
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,366
First is

1306
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,409
not have any sex, okay?

1307
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,895
That's the first way, okay?
Just not engage in that.

1308
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,207
That did not work out very
well for your mother and me.

1309
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,250
And what's the second way?

1310
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:29,535
Where you going?
Bathroom.

1311
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:30,655
You don't have to go
to the bathroom.

1312
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,126
Sit down, Mason, just sit down.

1313
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,601
What's the second way?

1314
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,335
Huh?

1315
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,095
Has your mother talked to
you guys about this stuff?

1316
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,175
No, Dad!

1317
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,760
No, come on, has she
talked to you about

1318
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,051
contraception?

1319
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,695
Huh?

1320
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,415
What, has she...
Condoms?

1321
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,335
She talked about that?
No, Dad, please, stop.

1322
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:52,521
What?

1323
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,211

the other day that said

1330
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,095
that although US teenagers are
not the most sexually active,

1331
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:15,681

of teenage pregnancy, okay?

We used to be

but we've kind of grown apart.

She sorta got all emo,

If you want
the big city around here,

1541
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,655
you have to drive
to San Antonio or Austin.

1542
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,535

1543

you knew
the 4-56 was there

1785
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:42,815
'cause we were bumping
House of Pain.

1786
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,015
It was like,
"Jump around, jump around."

1787
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,215
And the whole family's
coming outside,

1788
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:48,815
you got the kids and,
uh, the mom and the dad

1789
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,410
and they're all
bouncing up and down,

1790

we're throwing out
candies for the kids

1791

and soccer balls and Beanie

1792

1793
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:01,575
and, uh, they loved, they
absolutely loved Gatorade.

1794
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,683

1798
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:13,567

and one in Bosnia.

1801
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:20,975
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I was, um,
Army National Guard,

1802
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,650
and, you know, coming
straight out of high school,

1803
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,215
needed money for college.

1804
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:25,495
Seemed like a decent paying job.

1805
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:26,851
And, uh, did my tour.

1806
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,440
And whenever I got done
I told them,

1807
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,370
if there's a world-changing
event, I'll come back.

1808
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:36,202
And, uh, three months later 9/11
happened, and I was back 9/12.

1809
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,455
And I'm proud to say the 4-56,
the whole time we were there,

1810
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,975
we never lost a guy,
not one casualty.

1811
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,729
But is that odd?
Is that unusual?

1812
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:46,855
Yeah. Uh...

1813
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,723
Almost impossible.

1814
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:52,175
Like, the guys that came along
after us and replaced us,

1815
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:54,375
they didn't listen
to any of our advice.

1816
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:57,055

opposite of what we did,

1817
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:59,481

And Thomas says, "My Lord
and my God, I believe."

01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:40,001

"Well, that's good,"

can believe without seeing."

seen him in the flesh,

02:26:47,080 --> 02:26:48,855
The good news is
you're feeling stuff.

3066
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:51,645
And you've got to
hold on to that.

3067
02:26:52,080 --> 02:26:55,335
You do. I mean, you get older
and you don't feel as much.

3068
02:26:55,360 --> 02:26:57,175
Your skin gets tougher.

3069
02:26:57,200 --> 02:26:58,735
The point is those
pictures you took,

3070
02:26:58,760 --> 02:27:02,651
thousands of submissions from all
over the state, and you won.

3071
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:04,929
Well, I got silver.

Thank you.

3083
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:03,615
Okay, guys, let's be clear. We're gonna
break this into four categories.

3084
02:28:03,640 --> 02:28:05,935
One, anything you want to
keep from your childhood

3085
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:07,295
and you're taking with you.

3086
02:28:07,320 --> 02:28:11,405
Two, throwing away.
Three, donating.

3087
02:28:11,680 --> 02:28:13,935
And four, whatever you
want to try to sell

3088
02:28:13,960 --> 02:28:15,455
at the garage sale next weekend,

3089
02:28:15,480 --> 02:28:17,721
whatever we don't sell,
we're donating.

3090
02:28:18,320 --> 02:28:22,245
Doesn't the apartment have like an
attic, or storage or something?

3091
02:28:22,600 --> 02:28:24,887
No. You're missing the point.

3092
02:28:25,360 --> 02:28:28,170
We're not gonna drag a bunch of
crap to Mom's tiny apartment.

3093
02:28:28,840 --> 02:28:30,775
Can't believe
we're moving again.

3094
02:28:30,800 --> 02:28:32,215
No, I'm moving.

3095
02:28:32,240 --> 02:28:35,005
You moved two years ago. You
have an apartment in Austin.

3096
02:28:35,320 --> 02:28:37,243
Mason is moving in the fall.

3097
02:28:37,640 --> 02:28:39,255
I'm done.

3098
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:41,495
This'll be great for me.
I'll have all these options.

3099
02:28:41,520 --> 02:28:43,215
I could take a sabbatical.

3100
02:28:43,240 --> 02:28:45,695
I could get some writing done,
try to get published.

3101
02:28:45,720 --> 02:28:47,815
What about Christmas, though?
What are we gonna do?

3102
02:28:47,840 --> 02:28:49,775
I'm not sharing a room with him.

3103
02:28:49,800 --> 02:28:51,535
One of you will
sleep on the couch,

3104
02:28:51,560 --> 02:28:53,688
and we'll use that
blow-up mattress.

3105
02:28:54,320 --> 02:28:56,322
How am I supposed
to do my laundry?

3106
02:28:57,160 --> 02:29:00,084
Sam, I'm gently
pushing you out of the nest.

3107
02:29:00,600 --> 02:29:05,095
And on your way down, you may
magically find some quarters

3108
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:07,691
that you use to do laundry
in your own apartment.

3109
02:29:08,040 --> 02:29:11,362
Come on!
You guys are adults!

3110
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:15,366
You need to take some responsibility.
Now, what do you want?

3111
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:19,135
I'm gonna get the veggie burger.

3112
02:29:19,160 --> 02:29:21,242
I'm not having anything,
not hungry.

3113
02:29:21,880 --> 02:29:23,769
What's wrong with you?

3114
02:29:24,040 --> 02:29:25,371
I'm sick.

3115
02:29:26,160 --> 02:29:29,004
What is it, your head?
Do you have a fever?

No. To be honest, I drank
way too much last night.

You weren't driving, were you?
No, no.

3119

and we just hung out.

they just go down so easy.

3121

No, no. Hey,
that's not an excuse.

3122
02:29:48,280 --> 02:29:50,095
You can still pack boxes.

3123
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:53,095
These people want to move in
as soon as possible.

3124
02:29:53,120 --> 02:29:55,600
Hi, guys.
I'm Ernesto, how are you?

3125
02:29:56,920 --> 02:29:58,295
You probably don't remember me,

3126
02:29:58,320 --> 02:30:00,495
but I worked on your
septic line years ago.

3127
02:30:00,520 --> 02:30:01,567
Oh, yeah.

3128
02:30:02,360 --> 02:30:04,455
Believe it or not,
you changed my life.

3129
02:30:04,480 --> 02:30:06,775
You told me that day
that I was smart

3130
02:30:06,800 --> 02:30:08,768
and that I should go to school.

3131
02:30:09,160 --> 02:30:11,970
I took your advice. I signed
up for English classes,

3132
02:30:12,080 --> 02:30:14,135
and then a year later,
I went to community college

3133
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:15,415
and I got my Associate's degree,

3134
02:30:15,440 --> 02:30:17,575
and I'm working on my
bachelor's now at Texas State.

3135
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:19,090
And also one of
the managers here.

3136
02:30:19,320 --> 02:30:20,446
That's great.

3137
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:23,295
It's good to see you,
because I really wanted

3138
02:30:23,320 --> 02:30:25,975
a chance to thank you for that.

3139
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,480
<i>Gracias.</i> It really
meant a lot to me.

3140
02:30:29,560 --> 02:30:33,087
Don't worry about lunch. It's on me.
It's the least I can do.

3141
02:30:33,760 --> 02:30:36,604
You guys should listen to her.
She's a smart lady.

3142
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:38,611
Thank you.

3143
02:30:52,960 --> 02:30:54,215
Isn't that kind
of crazy, though,

3144
02:30:54,240 --> 02:30:55,775
that a computer
knows who you are

3145
02:30:55,800 --> 02:30:58,615
from just 20 questions
off a form?

3146
02:30:58,640 --> 02:31:01,895
I guess there are really only like
eight types of people in the world.

3147
02:31:01,920 --> 02:31:04,082
I mean, there are subsets
like male and female,

3148
02:31:04,200 --> 02:31:08,000
but apparently we're not as unique
as we want to think we are.

3149
02:31:08,120 --> 02:31:10,168
Have you even
talked to this guy yet?

3150
02:31:10,320 --> 02:31:13,775
No, but we've been trading emails.
He seems pretty cool.

3151
02:31:13,800 --> 02:31:16,770
He's studying
literature and anthropology

3152
02:31:16,880 --> 02:31:20,089
and he's way into Bright Eyes,
so that's not so bad.

3153
02:31:20,240 --> 02:31:22,295
But, anyways, he was
telling me about how

3154
02:31:22,320 --> 02:31:26,135
the system they use for assigning
roommates is kinda spooky.

3155
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:30,255
The freshman satisfaction rate for
new roommates used to be like 60%,

3156
02:31:30,280 --> 02:31:33,284
and now it's 100,
just 'cause of the computer.

3157
02:31:33,720 --> 02:31:36,883
Well, sounds like he'll be
a good roommate, then.

3158
02:31:37,640 --> 02:31:39,975
Yeah. But we
pretty much decided

3159
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,335
that soon they won't even
need a questionnaire

3160
02:31:42,360 --> 02:31:45,695
'cause they'll just let the
NSA scan your digital ghost

3161
02:31:45,720 --> 02:31:47,735
and they'll tell you
who your roommate is

3162
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:51,367
based on everything you've
ever said, written or clicked.

3163
02:31:51,720 --> 02:31:54,815

Getting married. Having kids.
Getting divorced.

3180
02:32:53,400 --> 02:32:55,815
The time that we thought
you were dyslexic.

3181
02:32:55,840 --> 02:32:57,365
When I taught you
how to ride a bike.

3182

Getting divorced again.
Getting my master's degree.

Finally getting
the job I wanted.

Got it timed perfectly. It'll kick
in when we get in the mountains.

3227
02:36:57,280 --> 02:36:58,930
Awesome. Let's go.

3228

<font color="#808080">MASON:</font> Do they let you
major in that here?

3229
02:37:08,240 --> 02:37:12,415
Well, it's not that serious here, so
I kinda train outside of university,

3230
02:37:12,440 --> 02:37:15,455
but I'm taking all my basics like
History of Dance and all that.

3231
02:37:15,480 --> 02:37:17,289
Nice.
Yeah.

3232
02:37:17,760 --> 02:37:19,091
What do you teach?

3233
02:37:19,200 --> 02:37:20,440
Oh, gosh.
<font color="#D900D9">(LAUGHS)</font>

3234
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:24,209
Ballet, tap, jazz, lyrical, hip-hop.
Wow...

3235
02:37:24,720 --> 02:37:26,295
Which one's your favorite?

3236
02:37:26,320 --> 02:37:27,455
Tap.

3237
02:37:27,480 --> 02:37:28,575
Yeah?
Yeah.

3238
02:37:28,600 --> 02:37:33,015
You get to like make up all your
own sounds, and there's no rules.

3239
02:37:33,040 --> 02:37:34,455
Just like creative freedom.

3240
02:37:34,480 --> 02:37:36,175
That's great.
Yeah.

3241
02:37:36,200 --> 02:37:37,815
That's why I love
teaching it, 'cause,

3242
02:37:37,840 --> 02:37:39,455
I don't know,
it's so beautiful to me,

3243
02:37:39,480 --> 02:37:41,895
and it's kind of dying
away in this generation,

3244
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:43,295
so, to be a part
of bringing it back

3245
02:37:43,320 --> 02:37:44,575
to the kids is really rewarding.

3246
02:37:44,600 --> 02:37:45,895
Right, keeps it going.
Yeah.

3247
02:37:45,920 --> 02:37:46,921
How old are they?

3248
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:48,655
Six to eight.
Wow.

3249
02:37:48,680 --> 02:37:52,287
Yeah. They have no fear, and
they're not self-conscious at all.

3250
02:37:52,400 --> 02:37:54,448
They haven't reached
the awkward years yet.

3251
02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:56,722
Yeah, not yet. It's coming.
