- she's like my best friend.
- I know.

"Huh. I don't think about
my husband like that."

"But that's okay."

751
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:32,790
And then another part
of my brain was like,

752
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:35,543
"No, that's not okay.
This is your life."

- It's not freaking me out.

Do they want to meet me?

- Do you...
- Totally fine.

787
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:17,002

tweaked my ankle.

1773
01:15:30,277 --> 01:15:32,518
So you're saying Northwestern
can't take that information

1774
01:15:32,529 --> 01:15:33,739
and continue the search?

1775
01:15:33,822 --> 01:15:35,407
This place is a shithole.
I'm sorry.

1776
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:36,825
Anna, could I have that?

1777
01:15:37,034 --> 01:15:38,714

for a second, all right?

- You don't.

- Yeah.

Don't...
You don't need a phone.

You don't need to call anybody
right now. The...

1786
01:15:49,254 --> 01:15:51,065
They're doing it. They're
the experts here, and...

1787
01:15:51,089 --> 01:15:52,591
- And I trust them.
- One, five...

There... There's a reason
they're number 17

I'll be honest with you,
it wasn't great.

2580
01:52:11,643 --> 01:52:13,019
No. I know.

2581
01:52:13,228 --> 01:52:17,357
But there was a lot I liked.
Like a... like a lot I liked.

2582

2583
01:52:26,533 --> 01:52:27,659
Really?

2584
01:52:27,742 --> 01:52:28,952
Yeah, um...

2585
01:52:30,078 --> 01:52:31,788
Mary and CJ and I are, like...

2586
01:52:34,749 --> 01:52:38,127
Just gonna drive out, and we
have a place all ready, and...

2587
01:52:40,296 --> 01:52:42,715
- When do you leave?
- Next weekend.

2588
01:52:43,550 --> 01:52:46,386
I... I'm so excited for you.
That is so great.

2589
01:52:46,636 --> 01:52:48,888
Like, you are going to just...

2590
01:52:49,222 --> 01:52:50,890
do so great in New York.

2591
01:52:54,352 --> 01:52:55,562
What were you gonna say?

2592
01:52:56,604 --> 01:52:57,647
What?

2593
01:52:58,273 --> 01:53:00,275
You said you were gonna
say something to me.

2594
01:53:01,317 --> 01:53:02,485
What was it?

2595
01:53:05,530 --> 01:53:08,449
Oh, just that I, um,
I wanted to thank you.

2596
01:53:09,576 --> 01:53:10,743
Uh, my parents told me

2597
01:53:10,827 --> 01:53:12,161
everything that you did for me,

2598
01:53:12,245 --> 01:53:13,765
and I feel like
the last time we spoke,

2599
01:53:13,788 --> 01:53:15,582
I didn't properly
thank you, so...

2600
01:53:15,873 --> 01:53:17,792
Oh. Yeah.

2602
01:53:22,046 --> 01:53:23,506
I should probably go.

- Do you want to call an Uber?
- No, I'm gonna walk, actually.

2604
01:53:26,884 --> 01:53:29,470
So, this has been really great.

2605
01:53:29,971 --> 01:53:31,014
All right.

2606
01:53:31,472 --> 01:53:33,683
- Okay, bye.
- Yeah.

2607
01:53:40,231 --> 01:53:41,352
The scene is gonna be, like,

2608
01:53:41,357 --> 01:53:42,859
so different
with you guys gone.

2609
01:53:43,359 --> 01:53:45,278
Well, you should come out.

2610

so much of secret
