1
00:01:33,558 --> 00:01:35,157
My name's Mike Hagen.

2
00:01:35,357 --> 00:01:36,757
I'm a sportswriter.

3
00:01:37,157 --> 00:01:39,557
If you read the papers,
maybe you've heard of me.

4
00:01:39,758 --> 00:01:43,758
I was involved in that ruckus up in Boston.

5
00:01:45,357 --> 00:01:48,357
A lot of people have asked me
for the facts about that affair.

6
00:01:48,357 --> 00:01:51,158
I certainly have no objection
to telling my side of it.

7
00:01:51,158 --> 00:01:53,757
Still, the story wouldn't be complete...

8
00:01:53,757 --> 00:01:57,157
...unless you heard from some
of the others involved, like...

9
00:01:57,358 --> 00:01:58,558
...Marilla.

10
00:01:58,957 --> 00:02:02,357
I imagine Marilla
might have something to say.

11
00:02:02,758 --> 00:02:04,557
I have a good deal to say.

12
00:02:05,357 --> 00:02:08,758
Not only about my side of it,
but about Mike's, too.

13
00:02:09,157 --> 00:02:13,158
Because Mike doesn't always tell the truth.

14
00:02:14,158 --> 00:02:19,158
Not that he means to lie or anything,
but, well, you have to know Mike.

15
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:22,757
Then, of course, there's someone else...

16
00:02:22,957 --> 00:02:25,757
...who could shed considerable light
on things...

17
00:02:26,157 --> 00:02:27,558
...if she will.

18
00:02:27,957 --> 00:02:31,557
I'm Lori Shannon.
I really have very little to tell.

19
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:35,357
I was involved, of course,
but in quite an innocent way.

20
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,158
Not everybody believed that.

21
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:42,757
But I'm sure Zachary Wilde does.

22
00:02:43,358 --> 00:02:46,557
Look, frankly,
I'd like to keep out of the whole mess.

23
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:51,757
However, there is another witness.
A man named Maxie Stulz.

24
00:02:51,757 --> 00:02:53,758
I'm sure he could be very informative.

25
00:02:56,958 --> 00:03:00,757
Yeah, I want to tell everything I know,
the whole truth.

26
00:03:01,157 --> 00:03:04,957
Because I was always a good standup boy.
Honest fighter.

27
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:08,557
I was champion for three years.
I'm making a comeback now.

28
00:03:08,757 --> 00:03:09,757
So...

29
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,358
...I want to tell everything I know,
everything.

30
00:03:14,357 --> 00:03:15,757
Let me think now.

31
00:03:20,357 --> 00:03:21,758
I don't know anything.

32
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:27,158
The whole thing began out in Beverly Hills,
the night of the California lnvitational...

33
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:28,557
...a golf tournament.

34
00:03:28,557 --> 00:03:31,757
I'd picked Johnny Strawn
in the sportswriters' Calcutta...

35
00:03:31,957 --> 00:03:35,757
...a sort of lottery.
And l'd won myself $1,200.

36
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,558
So I was buying that night and feeling fine.

37
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:40,357
Just fine.

38
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:45,957
Hey, Mike. I want to ask Mike.
Come here.

39
00:03:46,157 --> 00:03:50,157
Mike, tell the guy about the guy
that wears the glasses and the umpire....

40
00:03:50,557 --> 00:03:55,757
I say Johnny Strawn will be the best golfer
in America in 10 years.

41
00:04:01,557 --> 00:04:03,157
What do you think of that?

42
00:04:07,558 --> 00:04:10,957
I was feeling just fine the next morning.

43
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,357
It was noon.

44
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,158
I'd been up about half an hour...

45
00:04:19,757 --> 00:04:23,757
...showering, shaving and breakfasting
on a small tin of aspirin.

46
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:25,757
Nothing helped.

47
00:04:53,957 --> 00:04:55,157
Let's see now.

48
00:04:55,957 --> 00:04:59,157
Up until 10:00 the night before,
everything was crystal clear.

49
00:04:59,157 --> 00:05:01,958
I was having some drinks
with some newspaper friends...

50
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,157
...celebrating the $1,200 l'd won.

51
00:05:05,557 --> 00:05:06,557
$1,200.

52
00:05:08,757 --> 00:05:12,557
All I had now was three $10s
and a handful of silver.

53
00:05:13,957 --> 00:05:15,358
Going down.

54
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:17,558
Some newspapermen drink too much.

55
00:05:21,558 --> 00:05:22,558
Hi, boy.

56
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:24,758
Hi, Larry.

57
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,758
- How do you feel?
- Yeah.

58
00:05:28,357 --> 00:05:30,757
How did you handle the story yesterday?

59
00:05:31,357 --> 00:05:34,158
The story. The California Invitational.
Remember?

60
00:05:35,757 --> 00:05:38,358
You didn't forget to file your copy?

61
00:05:38,957 --> 00:05:42,157
Since when have I ever forgotten
to file my copy?

62
00:05:43,157 --> 00:05:44,757
There's always a first time.

63
00:05:44,757 --> 00:05:48,758
My copy. Had I forgotten it?
A lead flashed in front of my eyes.

64
00:05:48,758 --> 00:05:50,357
"Johnny Strawn...

65
00:05:50,758 --> 00:05:52,557
...the Gill-Sized Giant of Golfdom...

66
00:05:52,758 --> 00:05:55,958
...Smashes His Way to Victory
With a Sizzling 66."

67
00:05:56,157 --> 00:05:58,757
Had I written those words somewhere,
sometime?

68
00:05:58,757 --> 00:05:59,957
Had I dreamed them?

69
00:06:00,158 --> 00:06:01,557
Miss.

70
00:06:02,358 --> 00:06:05,157
- Yes, sir?
- I'd like to see a copy of a long wire...

71
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:09,757
...that I sent to The New York Record
late last night or 2:00 or 3:00 this morning.

72
00:06:10,357 --> 00:06:12,957
- Are you sick, mister?
- The wire, please.

73
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:13,957
Yes, sir.

74
00:06:14,157 --> 00:06:17,557
Well, let's see: The New York Times,
The New York Herald Tribune.

75
00:06:17,557 --> 00:06:18,958
The New York Record.

76
00:06:21,357 --> 00:06:25,158
The greatest golf story of the decade,
and l'd fluffed it.

77
00:06:25,957 --> 00:06:27,557
My career was ruined.

78
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:30,757
Coffee. That's what I needed, coffee.

79
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,358
Seven or eight pots of coffee,
in a quiet locale...

80
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:35,957
...where I could think up a good lie
for my editor.

81
00:06:36,157 --> 00:06:37,558
Coffee. Please.

82
00:06:40,557 --> 00:06:41,557
There he was.

83
00:06:41,557 --> 00:06:44,557
My character of the night before.
Mr. Michael Hagen.

84
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:49,158
I thought he saw me, too,
so I gave him a friendly wave.

85
00:06:53,358 --> 00:06:55,757
My character seemed
a little subdued this morning.

86
00:06:56,358 --> 00:06:58,558
It never occurred to me
that my character...

87
00:06:58,757 --> 00:07:00,957
...didn't have the slightest idea who I was.

88
00:07:01,957 --> 00:07:02,758
Well.

89
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,958
- Good morning. How do you feel?
- Great. Tiptop.

90
00:07:08,557 --> 00:07:10,157
Did you sleep all right?

91
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,958
Fine, I'm not even awake yet.

92
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:14,757
Your eyes are red.

93
00:07:15,557 --> 00:07:17,358
I bathed them in Alka-Fizz.

94
00:07:19,158 --> 00:07:21,557
Well, anyway, it's a beautiful morning.

95
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,558
Look. Isn't it lovely?

96
00:07:33,557 --> 00:07:35,157
May I make a suggestion?

97
00:07:35,157 --> 00:07:38,357
Why don't you jump into a swimsuit
and take a quick plunge?

98
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,757
- May I make a suggestion?
- What?

99
00:07:40,957 --> 00:07:42,358
You take a plunge.

100
00:07:42,557 --> 00:07:45,957
Sorry.
I guess you're not feeling very sociable.

101
00:07:46,957 --> 00:07:49,357
Here, I've been waiting all morning.

102
00:07:52,157 --> 00:07:53,357
Why? What's that?

103
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:55,357
$700. You gave it to me.

104
00:07:56,357 --> 00:07:57,758
- When?
- Last night.

105
00:07:58,557 --> 00:08:00,357
- What for?
- You liked me.

106
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,357
- That much, huh?
- Now.

107
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:07,158
- Here, you keep it.
- Don't be ridiculous.

108
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:09,158
- I gave it to you, it's yours.
- Please.

109
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:11,358
If I gave it to you, I must have meant it...

110
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,558
- Call for Mr. Hagen.
- Just a minute.

111
00:08:13,558 --> 00:08:14,558
- Boy.
- Yes, sir?

112
00:08:14,757 --> 00:08:17,558
- If you think...
- Mr. Hagen? New York is calling.

113
00:08:17,558 --> 00:08:19,957
- Where?
- You can take it in that booth there.

114
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,357
Now, listen, Mr. Hagen. Listen....

115
00:08:24,557 --> 00:08:28,158
I had to stay, if only to straighten
Mr. Hagen out on a few facts.

116
00:08:29,757 --> 00:08:32,158
- Mike Hagen here.
- Mr. Hagen?

117
00:08:32,358 --> 00:08:34,757
Ned Hammerstein
of The New York Record calling.

118
00:08:34,757 --> 00:08:36,157
Yeah, put him on.

119
00:08:36,957 --> 00:08:39,957
- Hello, Mike?
- Hello, Ned. Listen, about that copy.

120
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:42,758
I can't understand what happened.
I spoke to Western Union...

121
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:46,157
Never mind about the copy.
You're in a little trouble, boy.

122
00:08:46,557 --> 00:08:49,757
What do you mean, trouble?
I'm trying to explain why my copy...

123
00:08:49,757 --> 00:08:52,158
Forget it. The copy was okay. Now, look.

124
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:56,557
You mean you liked my copy?
The copy that I sent? Last night?

125
00:08:56,757 --> 00:08:59,957
Yes, it was all right.
Now what is the matter with you?

126
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:04,157
Nothing, Ned. Everything is great.

127
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:06,757
Well, everything is not so great back here.

128
00:09:06,957 --> 00:09:09,557
That column you did on Mart Daylor
and the fight racket.

129
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,557
He was here twice about a retraction,
he's plenty burned.

130
00:09:12,758 --> 00:09:15,157
Fine, fine. Good morning.

131
00:09:15,357 --> 00:09:17,958
- Are you listening to me?
- Certainly. Why?

132
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,957
I want to remind you, my friend...

133
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:23,158
...that Mart Daylor knows
some very influential people.

134
00:09:23,358 --> 00:09:25,157
Especially a bevy of thugs...

135
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:28,757
...who'd like to see you laid out in an alley
with your face bashed in.

136
00:09:28,957 --> 00:09:32,957
Okay, great, I'll take care of it right away.
You liked my copy?

137
00:09:32,957 --> 00:09:35,157
Yes, I told you twice! I liked the copy!

138
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:37,557
Okay, all right, Ned. Bye-bye.

139
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,157
I was a new man.

140
00:09:42,158 --> 00:09:44,957
My hangover was gone. I felt like singing.

141
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:52,558
I loved the whole world and all its people.

142
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:56,757
I would even, I decided, be nice
to that ugly girl who'd been annoying me.

143
00:09:58,558 --> 00:10:00,357
It must have been a different girl.

144
00:10:03,758 --> 00:10:07,757
Well, how would you like some breakfast?
Waiter.

145
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:11,158
A breakfast menu, please.

146
00:10:11,158 --> 00:10:15,157
I'd like to apologize for the way I acted.
I was a little revved up about something.

147
00:10:15,358 --> 00:10:19,157
There was a story that I was supposed
to send to New York and I was afraid....

148
00:10:19,157 --> 00:10:22,157
It's nothing that would interest you much.
It was a story that...

149
00:10:22,357 --> 00:10:25,557
You mean the "Johnny Strawn,
the Gill-Sized Giant of Golfdom" story?

150
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:28,557
- How did you know?
- We wrote it together. The two of us.

151
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:29,557
Where?

152
00:10:29,557 --> 00:10:33,158
In a very small and quite dirty bar and grill
about 40 miles north.

153
00:10:33,357 --> 00:10:37,158
- You wired the story from Santa Barbara.
- Then that's when.... That's why...

154
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:39,757
That's when you gave me $700.

155
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,757
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

156
00:10:45,957 --> 00:10:48,157
- What happened after that?
- Nothing.

157
00:10:48,157 --> 00:10:51,157
We drove home and I took you
to your door about 6:00.

158
00:10:51,357 --> 00:10:53,758
- You really don't remember?
- Go on.

159
00:10:53,758 --> 00:10:54,958
Well, nothing.

160
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,757
You shook my hand and told me
if I was ever in New York...

161
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,757
...to look you up and you'd find me a spot
in the sports-writing field.

162
00:11:02,557 --> 00:11:04,358
All right. When can you start?

163
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,757
I really wrote it?

164
00:11:08,558 --> 00:11:12,957
- Including that "Gill-Sized Giant of..."
- Well, actually that phrase was my idea.

165
00:11:13,558 --> 00:11:15,758
- I'm glad.
- I thought it was rather good.

166
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,758
- Where did we meet, anyway?
- Right over there at the bar.

167
00:11:18,758 --> 00:11:21,757
Then I was at Mrs. Herrington's
when you came in with friends.

168
00:11:21,757 --> 00:11:23,557
Yeah, Mrs. Herrington.

169
00:11:23,757 --> 00:11:26,357
- Yes.
- Yeah. Who's Mrs. Herrington?

170
00:11:28,757 --> 00:11:32,757
We began to laugh.
Three hours later, we were still laughing.

171
00:11:33,757 --> 00:11:35,957
- How about dinner?
- I'm afraid not.

172
00:11:36,157 --> 00:11:39,157
I'm on a 6:00 plane to New York.
Thanks anyway, though.

173
00:11:39,557 --> 00:11:42,357
Here, you earned it.
By helping me write the story.

174
00:11:42,357 --> 00:11:45,157
- Now, let's not play that again.
- No, you saved my job.

175
00:11:45,157 --> 00:11:46,157
Please.

176
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,158
Okay, we'll spend it.
That's the only way to settle things.

177
00:11:50,158 --> 00:11:52,557
Every penny, take a couple of days doing it.

178
00:11:52,557 --> 00:11:55,358
- If that isn't the silliest...
- After all, we worked hard.

179
00:11:55,557 --> 00:11:58,957
- We're entitled to relaxation, both of us.
- I don't need relaxation.

180
00:11:58,957 --> 00:12:01,157
- You work, don't you?
- Of course.

181
00:12:01,157 --> 00:12:04,557
- We'll spend it together, have a real ball.
- I couldn't possibly.

182
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,958
Nobody knows how to live anymore.
We're too busy to enjoy ourselves.

183
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,757
You know where you are right now?

184
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:14,158
- Well, just offhand...
- California, the playground of the West.

185
00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:18,158
It's all around us: The mountains,
the desert, Marineland, the Pacific Ocean.

186
00:12:18,358 --> 00:12:20,757
- Don't forget the Pacific Ocean.
- I won't.

187
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:24,357
Tell me, have you ever sailed
in a small boat way out on the ocean...

188
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:28,157
...with the salt spray in your face
and the wind in your hair?

189
00:12:28,758 --> 00:12:31,758
- No. Have you?
- Certainly not, do you think I'm crazy?

190
00:12:32,557 --> 00:12:34,357
But I'd be willing to try.

191
00:12:34,557 --> 00:12:38,158
- Come on.
- No, I couldn't. I couldn't possibly.

192
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:43,557
During the next four days,
we hardly made a dent in Mike's $700...

193
00:12:43,957 --> 00:12:47,157
...because all we did was lie around
and yak it up.

194
00:12:49,757 --> 00:12:52,357
- What's that?
- A sketch for a dress.

195
00:12:52,357 --> 00:12:55,758
- That's what I do, design clothes.
- For a living?

196
00:12:57,557 --> 00:13:00,157
Well, what do you know?

197
00:13:01,557 --> 00:13:04,557
That's why I must get back to New York
tonight. That's why....

198
00:13:04,557 --> 00:13:07,557
For heaven's sake,
do you realize I haven't packed yet?

199
00:13:08,757 --> 00:13:09,757
I'm sorry.

200
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,558
- Please, Mike, I've really got to rush.
- Wait.

201
00:13:15,357 --> 00:13:17,758
We have things to see:
Marineland, the porpoises.

202
00:13:17,957 --> 00:13:19,957
We haven't seen them feed the porpoises.

203
00:13:20,157 --> 00:13:23,157
Mike, it's out of the question.
I can't possibly. Come on.

204
00:13:24,157 --> 00:13:28,557
Welcome to Marineland of the Pacific,
the world's largest oceanarium.

205
00:13:29,757 --> 00:13:32,757
I can't remember who first brought up
the subject of love.

206
00:13:32,757 --> 00:13:34,957
It certainly doesn't sound like me.

207
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:38,957
One minute I was experting
on the care and feeding of porpoises...

208
00:13:39,157 --> 00:13:42,558
...and the next thing I knew,
we were talking about love. lts symptoms.

209
00:13:42,758 --> 00:13:45,357
I eat like a fool. When I'm in love, I mean.

210
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:49,958
My friends told me they couldn't swallow
a morsel, but I eat like a fool.

211
00:13:53,757 --> 00:13:56,557
With that boy from Yale,
some time ago, of course...

212
00:13:56,557 --> 00:14:00,358
...I gained eight pounds.
And then there was a certain artist.

213
00:14:03,558 --> 00:14:06,157
It was two years
before I got back to normal.

214
00:14:06,157 --> 00:14:09,157
I just eat and eat and eat.

215
00:14:10,557 --> 00:14:12,758
Just a cup of cold consommé, please.

216
00:14:13,357 --> 00:14:16,557
And maybe the tiniest bit of that pompano.

217
00:14:17,158 --> 00:14:20,158
And a large lobster salad and....

218
00:14:21,158 --> 00:14:22,957
Oh dear, you have trout.

219
00:14:23,158 --> 00:14:25,157
- Will you have both?
- All right.

220
00:14:25,358 --> 00:14:26,757
Then for dessert....

221
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:33,157
I felt the blush coming from my waist up.
Mike was staring at me.

222
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:37,758
But he knew it as well as I did.
I was in love with my character.

223
00:14:46,957 --> 00:14:48,358
How about it?

224
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:54,357
- Mike?
- We're adults.

225
00:14:56,357 --> 00:14:58,157
We know what we're doing.

226
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,357
I couldn't, Mike.

227
00:15:07,757 --> 00:15:10,957
She did, though.
We were married that night, in Arizona.

228
00:15:11,357 --> 00:15:14,757
Do you, Marilla, take Michael
to be your lawfully wedded husband...

229
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,957
...to love and to cherish....

230
00:15:17,358 --> 00:15:21,357
After a honeymoon of exactly
20 and a half hours, we flew to New York...

231
00:15:21,558 --> 00:15:23,758
...our arms locked the whole way.

232
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:27,958
Except for breakfast.
Marilla needed two hands for that.

233
00:15:28,157 --> 00:15:30,157
Ladies and gentlemen, it's expected...

234
00:15:30,157 --> 00:15:33,557
...we will land in New York
on scheduled time, which will be 9:10.

235
00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:37,158
- One hour. Where do you live, anyway?
- 74th Street.

236
00:15:37,757 --> 00:15:40,358
We'll stop at my place first. It's closer.

237
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:42,558
Then we'll hop a cab and get your stuff.

238
00:15:42,757 --> 00:15:45,558
- Cab? What about my furniture?
- Well, give it away.

239
00:15:45,957 --> 00:15:47,558
Can't live in two places.

240
00:15:48,957 --> 00:15:50,758
It was a wonderful trip.

241
00:15:51,557 --> 00:15:54,557
But a few minutes out of New York,
a strange thing happened.

242
00:15:55,157 --> 00:15:57,158
Marilla changed her clothes.

243
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:01,357
Sorry, madam, this seat is taken.

244
00:16:01,357 --> 00:16:04,358
I may have to stop by the office.
My working clothes.

245
00:16:04,557 --> 00:16:07,558
This was just the first
in a series of wardrobe changes...

246
00:16:07,558 --> 00:16:09,558
...which never failed to amaze me.

247
00:16:09,558 --> 00:16:12,758
Believe me, this kid changed her clothes
nine times a day.

248
00:16:13,558 --> 00:16:15,557
We went to Mike's apartment first.

249
00:16:16,157 --> 00:16:18,758
Just outside the door
he suddenly got embarrassed.

250
00:16:18,758 --> 00:16:20,958
Maybe I bragged too much
about this place.

251
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,958
- It's not the Taj Mahal or anything.
- Let me see.

252
00:16:25,757 --> 00:16:28,757
It's comfortable, that's what I'd say.
You'll love it.

253
00:16:28,757 --> 00:16:29,957
Open up.

254
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:31,957
Take a look.

255
00:16:33,757 --> 00:16:34,957
I took a look.

256
00:16:43,758 --> 00:16:46,557
First thing I thought of
was my little brother's shoebox...

257
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:48,958
...in which he used to keep
all his possessions.

258
00:16:49,158 --> 00:16:52,358
Old string and marbles
and bits of colored glass.

259
00:16:55,358 --> 00:16:58,358
The prospect of taking up
permanent residence in the shoebox...

260
00:16:58,358 --> 00:17:02,558
...was somewhat unnerving.
But I didn't want to hurt Mike's feelings.

261
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:04,957
He was so proud of everything.

262
00:17:09,157 --> 00:17:13,158
Opening off the shoebox
was a door leading to another shoebox...

263
00:17:13,757 --> 00:17:15,957
...which I assumed was the bedroom.

264
00:17:16,757 --> 00:17:19,757
The apartment wasn't really
at its best that day.

265
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:24,757
Things seemed a little out of place.

266
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:27,758
One thing in particular.

267
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:49,157
What else could I say?

268
00:17:49,357 --> 00:17:52,357
When it's cleaned up a little,
with new curtains and...

269
00:17:52,758 --> 00:17:54,957
...the right kind of pictures...

270
00:17:57,557 --> 00:17:59,557
...it'll be a real hellhole.

271
00:18:01,357 --> 00:18:04,357
- We'll move tomorrow.
- Mike.

272
00:18:08,757 --> 00:18:11,358
Just for tonight,
we'll stay at my place, all right?

273
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:12,358
Yeah.

274
00:18:12,957 --> 00:18:15,357
I guess I never looked at this trap before.

275
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:19,357
Hello. Yeah, Ned, I'm back. The office.

276
00:18:20,357 --> 00:18:23,157
I can't get down right now, I'm busy.
I've got a....

277
00:18:23,157 --> 00:18:25,557
- That's all right, go ahead.
- What?

278
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:30,357
Look, I've been threatened before.
Don't worry about the...

279
00:18:31,957 --> 00:18:33,358
All right, yeah.

280
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:35,557
Right away.

281
00:18:35,557 --> 00:18:38,157
How do you like that?
I'm back in town 20 minutes.

282
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:40,957
That's all right.
I've got plenty to do here anyway.

283
00:18:40,957 --> 00:18:42,357
- Mike?
- What?

284
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:47,758
- You're not in any trouble or anything?
- You mean that? No.

285
00:18:49,157 --> 00:18:50,557
What's the matter?

286
00:18:50,757 --> 00:18:53,958
It's just occurred to me.
I don't know you very well, do I?

287
00:18:57,158 --> 00:18:58,557
But well enough.

288
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:01,757
Maybe.

289
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:13,357
How about this? Our first parting.

290
00:19:15,757 --> 00:19:16,757
Sad.

291
00:19:24,757 --> 00:19:26,157
I think I'll stay.

292
00:19:41,157 --> 00:19:44,757
For the next hour or so,
I packed Mike's marbles and bits of glass...

293
00:19:44,757 --> 00:19:46,158
...singing happily.

294
00:19:47,158 --> 00:19:49,957
Until I came across a picture of a girl.

295
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,558
Well, I guess it was a girl.

296
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:55,558
She was certainly in an odd position.

297
00:19:58,157 --> 00:20:00,957
I wasn't worried, of course.
Just interested.

298
00:20:01,758 --> 00:20:04,557
I wanted to see
what a lady contortionist looked like.

299
00:20:09,557 --> 00:20:10,557
Nothing.

300
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:15,557
All I knew was that she had straight teeth
and the kind of expansion...

301
00:20:15,557 --> 00:20:17,157
...men seemed to favor.

302
00:20:18,358 --> 00:20:21,957
I measured it mentally against my own,
came off a bad second...

303
00:20:22,758 --> 00:20:25,557
...and tore her carefully into small pieces.

304
00:20:28,157 --> 00:20:31,557
At the office, I was the target
of the usual ribbing and laughter...

305
00:20:31,557 --> 00:20:33,757
...associated with holy matrimony.

306
00:20:34,357 --> 00:20:38,957
Luke Coslow, the office boy,
came up with a real side-splitter.

307
00:20:39,757 --> 00:20:40,557
Quiet.

308
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,357
Here you are, old man. Ready-made.
Saves time and trouble.

309
00:20:48,357 --> 00:20:51,157
Bachelor days are gone forever now.

310
00:20:53,157 --> 00:20:57,158
But I must say, my editor,
Ned Hammerstein, was very sentimental.

311
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:58,757
You're eight days late.

312
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,357
I'll take it off your vacation,
provided you get one.

313
00:21:01,557 --> 00:21:04,557
Meanwhile, if you got nothing to do,
cover the fight next week.

314
00:21:04,757 --> 00:21:06,957
Folks in town would like to know about it.

315
00:21:06,957 --> 00:21:10,757
Speaking of fights, you've got a sweet one
on your hands with Mart Daylor.

316
00:21:10,957 --> 00:21:14,758
- What's his beef?.
- Your column, March 16, this year.

317
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:19,557
"The great Martin Daylor, calling himself a
fight promoter is promoting mostly Daylor.

318
00:21:19,557 --> 00:21:22,557
He has a string on every fighter
and manager in New York.

319
00:21:22,557 --> 00:21:26,158
Nobody fights without his permission
and without paying his cut.

320
00:21:26,158 --> 00:21:29,957
I suggest that Mr. Daylor retire
to his palatial farm in Bucks County...

321
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:33,957
...before an irate sports world retires him
forcibly to the crooked boys' bin."

322
00:21:33,957 --> 00:21:35,957
What are you bucking for, a quick funeral?

323
00:21:36,157 --> 00:21:38,157
This isn't the roaring '20s. People don't...

324
00:21:38,357 --> 00:21:41,357
- Daylor would like that.
- Take a murder rap? He's too smart.

325
00:21:41,357 --> 00:21:42,557
Who mentioned murder?

326
00:21:42,557 --> 00:21:45,557
All that would happen is,
you're walking along Third Avenue...

327
00:21:45,557 --> 00:21:49,158
...a truck jumps the curb.
An accident, nobody's fault in the world.

328
00:21:49,158 --> 00:21:52,158
But you're cooling off on the pavement,
so you can't be sure.

329
00:21:52,158 --> 00:21:53,358
All right.

330
00:21:53,757 --> 00:21:55,557
What do you want me to do?

331
00:21:55,757 --> 00:21:58,358
- Print a retraction?
- I don't care what you do.

332
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,157
What am I, a sentimental slob?
Do what you want.

333
00:22:01,757 --> 00:22:05,758
Just make sure your by-line
doesn't appear in the obit column.

334
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,157
Okay, Ned.

335
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,157
Wait.

336
00:22:11,157 --> 00:22:12,158
Here.

337
00:22:18,557 --> 00:22:20,957
From Nora and me. A wedding present.

338
00:22:22,157 --> 00:22:24,157
- From Nora and...
- Well, from Nora.

339
00:22:24,157 --> 00:22:26,957
You liked it at the house,
she thought you could use it.

340
00:22:26,957 --> 00:22:30,557
I didn't have time to put paper.
Get it wrapped and send the bill to me.

341
00:22:30,758 --> 00:22:31,758
Ned.

342
00:22:33,157 --> 00:22:35,557
- I can't tell...
- No speeches.

343
00:22:35,557 --> 00:22:38,557
Come on, get it out of here, it's in my way.

344
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:50,157
Phone calls for Mr. Michael Hagen.

345
00:22:51,157 --> 00:22:52,558
Mart Daylor.

346
00:22:59,157 --> 00:23:00,357
Lori Shannon.

347
00:23:02,357 --> 00:23:04,557
I hadn't thought of her once in eight days.

348
00:23:05,158 --> 00:23:07,158
When I did now, it didn't feel so good.

349
00:23:07,358 --> 00:23:09,158
I was speaking of Lori Shannon...

350
00:23:09,158 --> 00:23:11,757
...the girl you are probably worried about.

351
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:14,157
However, since you've retired
from the field...

352
00:23:14,357 --> 00:23:18,558
...you might inform Miss Shannon
of a handsome, young newspaperman...

353
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:21,557
...who would be very,
very happy to substitute at any...

354
00:23:23,557 --> 00:23:25,157
Very funny.

355
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,557
Very funny.

356
00:23:32,358 --> 00:23:36,157
1 1:00 a.m.
She was probably still at her TV rehearsal.

357
00:23:44,157 --> 00:23:48,758
"There'll be a change in the weather

358
00:23:49,357 --> 00:23:52,757
and a change in the sea.

359
00:23:54,357 --> 00:23:59,757
From now on there'll be a change in me.

360
00:24:00,557 --> 00:24:04,558
My walk will be different,

361
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:08,157
my talk and my name.

362
00:24:09,758 --> 00:24:15,157
Nothing about me's goin' be the same.

363
00:24:15,157 --> 00:24:20,158
I'm gonna change my way of living.

364
00:24:20,357 --> 00:24:23,358
If that ain't enough

365
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:28,558
Then I'll change the way I

366
00:24:29,957 --> 00:24:32,357
strut my stuff.

367
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:37,357
Because nobody wants you
when you're old and gray.

368
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:46,158
There'll be some changes made today.

369
00:24:47,757 --> 00:24:52,957
There'll be some changes made."

370
00:25:05,357 --> 00:25:08,757
He arrived about noon,
my Lochinvar from out of the west.

371
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:10,957
Come to tell me about his marriage.

372
00:25:18,957 --> 00:25:21,757
He stood there,
like he was awaiting his execution.

373
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:28,357
He was nice and tan
after his California vacation.

374
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:31,357
Healthy-looking, too.

375
00:25:32,757 --> 00:25:35,757
Of course, he'd only been married
for a day and a half.

376
00:25:35,957 --> 00:25:37,557
"Nobody

377
00:25:37,557 --> 00:25:42,358
wants you when you're old and gray.

378
00:25:43,757 --> 00:25:49,157
There'll be some changes made today.

379
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:55,357
There'll be some changes made"

380
00:26:03,358 --> 00:26:05,757
- Hello, Mike.
- Hello, Lori.

381
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:09,558
- How have you been?
- Quite well.

382
00:26:12,157 --> 00:26:14,357
- How are you?
- I've been quite well.

383
00:26:15,957 --> 00:26:18,557
- You look well.
- I feel....

384
00:26:29,557 --> 00:26:33,358
- Where are we going, on a picnic?
- No. This is a....

385
00:26:36,157 --> 00:26:38,157
My boss, Ned Hammerstein....

386
00:26:42,557 --> 00:26:44,958
- Look, how about lunch?
- I'd love it.

387
00:26:45,757 --> 00:26:48,357
It'll just take me a minute
to change clothes.

388
00:26:51,757 --> 00:26:55,157
We went to Andrucci's, our old hangout.

389
00:26:55,757 --> 00:26:57,957
And we ordered our old favorite.

390
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:00,357
Ravioli Andrucci.

391
00:27:02,357 --> 00:27:04,957
He hadn't gotten around
to confessing his marriage...

392
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:07,157
...and was making a botch
of the small talk.

393
00:27:07,357 --> 00:27:09,557
...when I walked into the office.
Everyone....

394
00:27:09,557 --> 00:27:11,357
Ned is the same Simon Legree....

395
00:27:11,357 --> 00:27:13,757
He was so pathetic, I had to help him out.

396
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:17,757
- Look, I've got something to tell you.
- Let me tell you, Mike.

397
00:27:19,358 --> 00:27:24,157
You found a girl.
The most wonderful girl in the world.

398
00:27:25,157 --> 00:27:27,957
The kind of girl
you just couldn't live without...

399
00:27:27,957 --> 00:27:30,157
...and you married her. That's all.

400
00:27:33,157 --> 00:27:35,357
- I knew you'd understand.
- Why shouldn't I?

401
00:27:35,357 --> 00:27:39,357
There's no point in making a federal case
out of something that couldn't be helped.

402
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:43,158
I'd have probably done the same thing
myself, if I'd found the right man.

403
00:27:43,557 --> 00:27:45,557
I thought because I didn't send....

404
00:27:45,557 --> 00:27:48,558
He was as grateful as a St. Bernard,
and I felt generous...

405
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:51,357
...and warm-hearted inside.
It was a good scene.

406
00:27:52,157 --> 00:27:55,957
But then I made a mistake.
I asked him to tell me about her.

407
00:27:56,557 --> 00:27:59,557
And he made a bigger mistake.
He told me.

408
00:27:59,557 --> 00:28:01,557
She's not like anyone else I know....

409
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:05,957
I heard all about her eyes,
and her hair, and her figure...

410
00:28:06,357 --> 00:28:07,957
...and the way she walked.

411
00:28:07,957 --> 00:28:12,157
I heard all about her fine sense of humor
and her clothes...

412
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:15,357
...and the cute way she had
of tilting her head when she laughed.

413
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:18,357
...tossing her head when she laughs,
sort of like a pony.

414
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:21,557
After a while, I knew her like a sister.

415
00:28:21,758 --> 00:28:25,357
Anyway, I'm so glad that you understand.

416
00:28:26,757 --> 00:28:27,958
Why shouldn't I?

417
00:28:56,757 --> 00:28:59,957
Well, I guess I'd better be getting back
to rehearsal.

418
00:29:00,358 --> 00:29:05,357
- You don't mind if I don't get up?
- Please don't.

419
00:29:08,157 --> 00:29:11,958
- Mr. Hagen, you didn't get your lunch.
- Yeah, I got it.

420
00:29:13,557 --> 00:29:16,157
- Why haven't you served Mr. Hagen?
- But I brought it.

421
00:29:16,157 --> 00:29:17,757
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

422
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,158
Bring him another.

423
00:29:21,357 --> 00:29:25,358
- Would you like to have something else?
- No. That'll be plenty.

424
00:29:25,757 --> 00:29:28,558
Just get me a check and a pair of pants.

425
00:29:29,157 --> 00:29:30,157
A pair of pants?

426
00:29:30,357 --> 00:29:33,758
Look, don't make a fuss.
Borrow me a pair of pants from somebody.

427
00:29:33,957 --> 00:29:34,957
No fuss.

428
00:29:35,557 --> 00:29:37,958
- How did it happen?
- A lady did it.

429
00:29:38,357 --> 00:29:40,357
- Borrow the pants.
- Yes, sir.

430
00:29:46,757 --> 00:29:51,358
- Are you sure? I'm Mr. Hagen's wife.
- I still don't think he's here.

431
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:55,357
Yes, he is. I just remembered.

432
00:29:55,357 --> 00:29:57,357
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

433
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:00,157
He's right over there.

434
00:30:04,357 --> 00:30:06,357
Well, what a small world.

435
00:30:07,158 --> 00:30:09,357
You don't mind if I don't get up?

436
00:30:10,957 --> 00:30:12,757
- Shy about kissing in public?
- No.

437
00:30:12,957 --> 00:30:16,157
Your office told me you might be here
and I wanted to see you anyway.

438
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:18,157
Big news: I've got everything moved.

439
00:30:18,157 --> 00:30:21,558
Zach Wilde sent over a car
and the janitor carried your bags down.

440
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:23,357
That's fine. I'm glad.

441
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:26,157
I got a pair of pants for you
in the men's room.

442
00:30:27,758 --> 00:30:30,357
I'd have sworn you had pants on
when you left.

443
00:30:31,557 --> 00:30:32,757
What's that?

444
00:30:33,557 --> 00:30:36,158
That? That's ravioli.

445
00:30:37,358 --> 00:30:40,957
Of course. I should have recognized it.
Didn't you care for it?

446
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,957
Yes, it's very good here.

447
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:46,757
It certainly doesn't go with gray.

448
00:30:46,757 --> 00:30:48,957
It's the busboy's pants. Green ones.

449
00:30:49,357 --> 00:30:53,357
I'm going into the men's room now
and change into the busboy's green pants.

450
00:30:53,357 --> 00:30:56,157
And then we'll go up to my place
and pick up a suit.

451
00:30:56,157 --> 00:30:58,958
You haven't been listening.
Your clothes are at my place.

452
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:00,557
Yes. Fine.

453
00:31:17,557 --> 00:31:20,157
- You shouldn't have done it.
- I'm sorry.

454
00:31:25,357 --> 00:31:29,757
I'd have wagered a Lily Daché hat
there'd been another woman at that table.

455
00:31:31,157 --> 00:31:35,357
But I wasn't going to ruin my second day
of marriage with petty jealousies.

456
00:31:42,157 --> 00:31:46,357
For some reason, l'd pictured Marilla
living in a one-room kitchenette...

457
00:31:46,557 --> 00:31:48,958
...with a girlfriend who studied music.

458
00:31:50,357 --> 00:31:52,957
This place even had an outside flunky.

459
00:31:54,358 --> 00:31:55,557
Very refined.

460
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,157
Here we are.

461
00:32:13,757 --> 00:32:17,957
He tried not to notice my pants,
and I tried not to notice his.

462
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:41,357
Well? Say something.

463
00:32:42,557 --> 00:32:43,757
Chic.

464
00:32:45,358 --> 00:32:46,358
Chic.

465
00:32:47,157 --> 00:32:51,357
That's a word I've never used before,
but now I know what it means.

466
00:32:51,957 --> 00:32:55,157
Miss Brown. Congratulations, Miss Brown.

467
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,557
Mrs. Hagen, Gwen. And this is Mr. Hagen.

468
00:32:58,758 --> 00:33:01,557
- Mr. Hagen, it's certainly a pleasure.
- How do you do?

469
00:33:01,557 --> 00:33:04,158
Don't worry about his pants, Gwen.
He borrowed them.

470
00:33:04,158 --> 00:33:06,557
Of course he did. Wouldn't you know?

471
00:33:06,557 --> 00:33:09,358
- Get these to the cleaners, will you?
- Sure.

472
00:33:10,358 --> 00:33:13,358
Be careful. You might find some ravioli
in the pockets.

473
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:14,558
And here.

474
00:33:14,757 --> 00:33:17,957
Put this in a place of honor.
Our first wedding present.

475
00:33:18,157 --> 00:33:20,357
Oh, no, it isn't. It's the second.

476
00:33:20,758 --> 00:33:22,958
- Well, what do you mean?
- Look.

477
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:26,357
A coffee table!

478
00:33:27,357 --> 00:33:29,557
I don't have to read it, I know.

479
00:33:31,357 --> 00:33:35,157
"You always wanted this table,
but you wouldn't marry me to get it...

480
00:33:35,157 --> 00:33:38,157
...so, here with all my love.
Zachary Wilde."

481
00:33:44,157 --> 00:33:46,157
He always wanted me to marry him.

482
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:50,958
I figured. Tell me, how soon can I punch
Zachary Wilde in the snoot?

483
00:33:57,957 --> 00:33:59,757
- What's on your mind?
- Guess.

484
00:34:01,157 --> 00:34:03,358
You're gonna bite me on the ear again?

485
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:04,957
Don't you like it?

486
00:34:05,957 --> 00:34:09,957
It's a very strange,
but pleasurable sensation.

487
00:34:10,557 --> 00:34:11,758
Mike.

488
00:34:14,157 --> 00:34:15,157
Surprise!

489
00:34:15,757 --> 00:34:16,757
Surprise!

490
00:34:17,158 --> 00:34:18,357
Surprise!

491
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:19,957
Congratulations.

492
00:34:20,557 --> 00:34:22,158
Where did you snare the man?

493
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:24,557
And how? That's what I want to know.

494
00:34:27,757 --> 00:34:30,357
This is my husband, Michael Hagen.

495
00:34:30,957 --> 00:34:35,357
Fred Sellers, Marie Dozier,
Dottie Weaves, Florrie Canfield, Mr. Orjac.

496
00:34:35,957 --> 00:34:37,357
My husband.

497
00:34:40,157 --> 00:34:43,958
Ann Ashmond, Jennifer Dean,
Jeff Dowling...

498
00:34:44,357 --> 00:34:46,357
...Pauline Beaton, Sheldon Stevens.

499
00:34:46,557 --> 00:34:48,557
This is Michael.

500
00:34:49,158 --> 00:34:53,558
All right, sweetheart, let's get it over with.
Congratulations.

501
00:34:57,957 --> 00:35:00,557
Let's have the whole story,
right from the beginning.

502
00:35:00,758 --> 00:35:02,157
Old-fashioned romance....

503
00:35:02,357 --> 00:35:04,958
Congratulations, darling.

504
00:35:05,757 --> 00:35:08,357
Darling, congratulations.

505
00:35:08,557 --> 00:35:12,557
I can't stick around. I've got a show
in rehearsal. You know how it is.

506
00:35:20,157 --> 00:35:24,557
Usually I'm a little more presentable,
but I was having lunch today...

507
00:35:24,557 --> 00:35:26,758
That's my monkey!

508
00:35:29,157 --> 00:35:30,958
It was really very amusing.

509
00:35:31,157 --> 00:35:33,958
I spilled something,
and this little Italian waiter...

510
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:36,357
The pig. That's the one I got Marilla.

511
00:35:55,357 --> 00:35:58,757
I figured if I put on my new suit,
maybe I could join the club.

512
00:36:00,957 --> 00:36:02,158
I couldn't.

513
00:36:02,957 --> 00:36:05,157
I guess I didn't speak the language.

514
00:36:05,757 --> 00:36:07,757
Are you telling me about fashion shows?

515
00:36:07,757 --> 00:36:09,558
- Whose is it?
- Mine.

516
00:36:14,357 --> 00:36:15,557
Here.

517
00:36:16,557 --> 00:36:19,357
Can't get a tumble here
unless you're gift-wrapped.

518
00:36:20,157 --> 00:36:23,158
I see you changed your pants.

519
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,957
Thanks. And you're the only one
who's noticed.

520
00:36:26,957 --> 00:36:29,557
There must be quite a story
someplace in those pants.

521
00:36:29,757 --> 00:36:31,557
A pretty dull one, I'm afraid.

522
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:35,157
If there's one thing I can't stand,
it's a surprise party.

523
00:36:35,157 --> 00:36:39,157
Listen to them. If I were you,
I'd throw them all out, myself included.

524
00:36:41,557 --> 00:36:42,557
Who are they?

525
00:36:42,557 --> 00:36:47,357
Now, let's see. There's one actor,
one playwright, one composer...

526
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:50,357
...two actresses, a television director.

527
00:36:50,357 --> 00:36:53,957
And the old bag in the blue dress
is Jennifer Dean, a designer.

528
00:36:54,158 --> 00:36:58,358
The excitable type arguing with her
is Christopher Matthew, also a designer.

529
00:36:58,558 --> 00:37:00,558
Known on his labels as "Mr. Chris."

530
00:37:01,157 --> 00:37:04,758
I think that's about all.
Oh, yes, and one theatrical producer.

531
00:37:05,758 --> 00:37:10,357
I liked this guy right away.
Nice fellow. Trim. Distinguished.

532
00:37:11,357 --> 00:37:13,958
I've been after Marilla
to design a show for me.

533
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:16,357
You think you could talk her into it?

534
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:18,358
I can try.

535
00:37:19,158 --> 00:37:21,957
Say, in all the excitement,
I missed your name.

536
00:37:22,358 --> 00:37:24,157
Wilde. Zachary Wilde.

537
00:37:24,957 --> 00:37:26,957
Sure. Zachary Wilde.

538
00:37:28,558 --> 00:37:33,157
I felt like taking his coffee table and
cracking him right over the head with it.

539
00:37:35,157 --> 00:37:37,557
My idiot friends stayed till almost 7:00.

540
00:37:37,557 --> 00:37:41,357
I gave Gwen the night off
and cooked dinner with my own lily hands.

541
00:37:41,557 --> 00:37:44,358
I was jittery about Mike's reaction
to the apartment.

542
00:37:44,358 --> 00:37:47,358
I wanted to balance things
with a show of domesticity.

543
00:37:48,157 --> 00:37:50,957
You're loaded?

544
00:37:51,357 --> 00:37:53,758
Just prodigal. This place keeps me broke.

545
00:37:53,758 --> 00:37:56,758
There was the inheritance from Dad.
It's all gone now.

546
00:37:56,758 --> 00:38:00,757
- Where do you come from?
- That's a funny question. St. Louis.

547
00:38:01,557 --> 00:38:03,757
Miss Brown of the St. Louis Browns.

548
00:38:03,757 --> 00:38:06,357
How did you hear of us?
We weren't that rich.

549
00:38:06,357 --> 00:38:09,358
I didn't. It used to be a baseball team.

550
00:38:09,757 --> 00:38:11,358
I was making a joke.

551
00:38:12,558 --> 00:38:14,157
It's a shock, you know.

552
00:38:14,757 --> 00:38:19,557
You marry a nice girl out in California.
You think it might be quite a treat for her.

553
00:38:20,157 --> 00:38:23,157
You take the little girl East,
show her the big city...

554
00:38:23,557 --> 00:38:25,557
...let her meet a few people.

555
00:38:25,757 --> 00:38:30,357
Then you find out she knows all of
New York, and owns a sizeable chunk of it.

556
00:38:31,557 --> 00:38:34,757
It's a shock. Bad for the ego.

557
00:38:36,157 --> 00:38:38,558
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You didn't ask.

558
00:38:38,558 --> 00:38:40,957
I didn't ask
if you were a second baseman...

559
00:38:40,957 --> 00:38:44,157
...but if you had been,
I'd expect you to confide in me.

560
00:38:44,557 --> 00:38:46,758
All right, I didn't want to tell you.

561
00:38:47,357 --> 00:38:48,557
Why should I?

562
00:38:48,557 --> 00:38:53,158
I've been shopping for you for a long time.
I didn't want to lose you on a technicality.

563
00:38:53,158 --> 00:38:57,757
You live like this just from drawing
those little pictures? Designing?

564
00:38:58,557 --> 00:39:00,757
Except when men give me $700.

565
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:03,157
I make jokes, too.

566
00:39:04,558 --> 00:39:06,757
You like this place?

567
00:39:07,558 --> 00:39:10,357
I always thought I did.
I hoped you'd like it, too.

568
00:39:11,157 --> 00:39:14,157
That's why I tricked you
into spending the night here.

569
00:39:14,557 --> 00:39:16,958
And you like designing clothes?

570
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:19,757
I love designing clothes.

571
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:23,957
It's a silly, ridiculous business
and it pays far too much money.

572
00:39:24,158 --> 00:39:27,558
And you meet silly,
ridiculous people and I love it.

573
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,757
Not the people, the job.

574
00:39:30,558 --> 00:39:33,357
And what's more,
if you don't like this place...

575
00:39:33,357 --> 00:39:36,357
...let's get out of it.
It's just too much, isn't it?

576
00:39:37,157 --> 00:39:40,757
We'll go to your place.
Or we'll sleep in the subway. I don't care.

577
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:44,158
If you think you'll worm out of this
on an incompatibility charge...

578
00:39:44,158 --> 00:39:46,158
...you can start thinking over again!

579
00:39:46,158 --> 00:39:47,557
You're not crying?

580
00:39:48,158 --> 00:39:50,757
No, but I'm considering it very seriously.

581
00:39:50,757 --> 00:39:52,558
Now, slow down.

582
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,157
It's not a bad place.

583
00:39:54,357 --> 00:39:57,357
Some people might consider it
a very livable place.

584
00:39:57,957 --> 00:40:01,758
Throw in a couple of rubber plants,
and an autographed Yankee ball...

585
00:40:01,758 --> 00:40:03,557
...and you'd be surprised.

586
00:40:03,758 --> 00:40:05,958
A fellow could be very snug here.

587
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:07,357
Oh, Mike.

588
00:40:08,757 --> 00:40:09,957
Now, it's okay.

589
00:40:10,957 --> 00:40:12,158
Cut it out.

590
00:40:12,957 --> 00:40:14,358
Everything's fine.

591
00:40:16,757 --> 00:40:17,957
Compatible?

592
00:40:18,558 --> 00:40:19,558
Compatible.

593
00:40:24,157 --> 00:40:26,157
Do you smell something burning?

594
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,758
It's just the sauce...

595
00:40:29,757 --> 00:40:31,157
...for the ravioli.

596
00:40:38,557 --> 00:40:41,157
For a whole month,
we were as happy as birds.

597
00:40:41,757 --> 00:40:44,757
I didn't know anything
about the designing business...

598
00:40:45,357 --> 00:40:47,957
...and she didn't know anything
about sports.

599
00:40:53,557 --> 00:40:58,357
During the day, we lived in two
separate worlds, about five miles apart.

600
00:41:01,357 --> 00:41:03,757
And at night, we made a world of our own.

601
00:41:04,557 --> 00:41:07,157
Yeah, it was a wonderful month.

602
00:41:08,358 --> 00:41:09,957
I gained six pounds.

603
00:41:14,357 --> 00:41:15,557
The fights?

604
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:18,357
I've never been to the fights, Mike.
I'd love to.

605
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:20,757
I can't make up my mind which one.

606
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:23,357
The mill has to know.
They're still on the telephone.

607
00:41:23,557 --> 00:41:24,757
Just a minute, please.

608
00:41:24,957 --> 00:41:29,158
What? I said I'd love to go, Mike.
Where do I meet you?

609
00:41:29,158 --> 00:41:30,957
Try that over the shoulder.

610
00:41:31,157 --> 00:41:34,957
What? Gotham Arena. Fine.
Mike, what do I wear?

611
00:41:35,558 --> 00:41:37,957
What do the other women wear to fights?

612
00:41:38,157 --> 00:41:40,957
All right, I'll figure out something.
8:30. 'Bye.

613
00:41:44,157 --> 00:41:45,958
Now, let's see.

614
00:41:47,158 --> 00:41:48,958
All right, I'll take this one.

615
00:41:49,357 --> 00:41:52,557
She's decided.
Hello, she's decided on 4-1 7-X.

616
00:41:52,957 --> 00:41:54,957
If I could have just one minute?

617
00:41:54,957 --> 00:41:58,757
Please, I've got this fashion show
just staring me in the face.

618
00:41:58,957 --> 00:42:02,357
I realize your problem.
I have one, too. A musical show.

619
00:42:02,758 --> 00:42:04,157
Bright, witty, modern...

620
00:42:04,557 --> 00:42:08,357
...now highly expensive, since I'm waiting
for a designer to make up her mind.

621
00:42:08,357 --> 00:42:10,157
It's more than just my mind.

622
00:42:10,357 --> 00:42:13,757
What would the store think?
I'm just an employee here, you know.

623
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:16,158
Besides, I've never done theatrical designs.

624
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,557
That's why I want you.

625
00:42:17,557 --> 00:42:20,757
You'll be fresh, different.
It needs your high style.

626
00:42:21,157 --> 00:42:22,358
I don't know.

627
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:24,957
Randy's supposed to put the numbers
in work next week.

628
00:42:24,957 --> 00:42:28,157
He can't move unless he has some idea
what the wardrobe will be.

629
00:42:28,157 --> 00:42:31,557
- Zach, I just don't know.
- I agree with her 100°/°.

630
00:42:32,557 --> 00:42:34,557
- What?
- You just don't know.

631
00:42:34,557 --> 00:42:37,357
- Randy!
- I love Marilla, I love her work.

632
00:42:37,357 --> 00:42:40,557
- But not for this. She's all wrong.
- Oh, really!

633
00:42:40,757 --> 00:42:44,158
Designing a musical show, my pet,
is not done over the weekend.

634
00:42:44,158 --> 00:42:46,757
- You just can't toss it off.
- But I'm not trying...

635
00:42:46,757 --> 00:42:48,957
I have ideas, you know.

636
00:42:48,957 --> 00:42:52,758
And above all, any wardrobe designed
for this show has got to dance.

637
00:42:53,957 --> 00:42:56,557
- Look, I'm not asking to do this.
- Look at this!

638
00:42:56,557 --> 00:42:58,958
Beautiful! Wonderful design!

639
00:42:59,157 --> 00:43:00,958
As long as she stands like this.

640
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:02,357
But can she do this?

641
00:43:03,557 --> 00:43:05,957
Don't tell me it's impossible.
Nothing's impossible.

642
00:43:06,158 --> 00:43:07,557
- Who said that?
- The bongo number.

643
00:43:07,557 --> 00:43:10,157
I have no idea what I may do
with the bongo number.

644
00:43:10,157 --> 00:43:11,957
I may go completely insane.

645
00:43:11,957 --> 00:43:15,558
And if I do, I want the clothes
to go completely insane with me.

646
00:43:16,157 --> 00:43:18,758
I admire your honesty
in admitting you can't do it.

647
00:43:18,758 --> 00:43:21,557
- I haven't admitted anything.
- We have five weeks.

648
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:24,557
- She couldn't learn in five years.
- I could do it in five days.

649
00:43:24,757 --> 00:43:25,757
- Will you?
- Yes!

650
00:43:25,757 --> 00:43:26,757
Good.

651
00:43:26,757 --> 00:43:29,158
We got what we came for.
May we leave now?

652
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:30,957
When can we get together?

653
00:43:31,557 --> 00:43:35,358
Zach, please give me a few days.
I've got the fashion show.

654
00:43:35,557 --> 00:43:38,757
I want to have a reading of the play
for you creative minds.

655
00:43:39,558 --> 00:43:41,357
How about Wednesday night?

656
00:43:41,357 --> 00:43:44,357
- I'll have the others.
- Zach, will you please get him out?

657
00:43:44,557 --> 00:43:46,557
- Wednesday night.
- Yeah, Wednesday night.

658
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:49,157
- Randy?
- I don't think I'll do a bongo number.

659
00:43:49,357 --> 00:43:51,157
Did I ever tell you the idea....

660
00:43:51,157 --> 00:43:54,357
Let's tear this up and start all over again.
Tear it apart.

661
00:44:02,957 --> 00:44:04,558
Two, three...

662
00:44:05,357 --> 00:44:07,357
...four, five....

663
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,758
I'll say one thing:

664
00:44:12,758 --> 00:44:16,557
Marilla was the best-dressed fight fan
the seconds had ever seen.

665
00:44:28,558 --> 00:44:30,157
Hi, girl.

666
00:44:30,357 --> 00:44:31,957
Am I late? I'm sorry.

667
00:44:32,157 --> 00:44:35,157
That jersey print came in
and I had to tell them how to cut it.

668
00:44:35,157 --> 00:44:36,557
- How are you?
- Fine.

669
00:44:36,557 --> 00:44:38,758
- Who's winning?
- Galatos. It's a slaughter.

670
00:44:47,757 --> 00:44:49,957
Give it to him!
Where did you get that thing?

671
00:44:54,957 --> 00:44:57,558
Who told you, you could fight,
you groundhog?

672
00:45:13,158 --> 00:45:16,157
How are you, Mike? Congratulations.

673
00:45:17,157 --> 00:45:20,157
- Thanks.
- You didn't return my call.

674
00:45:20,558 --> 00:45:22,957
Calls, Mr. Daylor. About 20 of them.

675
00:45:24,157 --> 00:45:27,958
I read again yesterday
that I'm a very disreputable character.

676
00:45:28,357 --> 00:45:31,557
What was that phrase?
"A hydra-headed monster"?

677
00:45:31,958 --> 00:45:34,757
"Feeding with all nine mouths
on the boxing game."

678
00:45:35,158 --> 00:45:39,158
My boy at Princeton was quite upset.
They don't appreciate that at Princeton.

679
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:41,557
- He can switch to Harvard.
- Be reasonable.

680
00:45:41,557 --> 00:45:44,957
I'm a family man.
I've got a lot of responsibilities.

681
00:45:45,357 --> 00:45:49,357
I admit I take a dollar or two
under the table, but I pay all my taxes.

682
00:45:49,758 --> 00:45:52,357
- I don't kick dogs.
- Just people, huh?

683
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,557
Throw the bums out of the ring!

684
00:45:54,757 --> 00:45:58,357
Joey Yustick shouldn't be within 10 miles
of a prize ring and you know it.

685
00:46:02,158 --> 00:46:04,957
He gets his brains loosened
every time he climbs in there.

686
00:46:04,957 --> 00:46:08,558
But he pays you extra dues,
so you see to it he gets plenty of action.

687
00:46:08,757 --> 00:46:09,957
He's over 21 .

688
00:46:09,957 --> 00:46:12,558
He's over 41, Mr. Daylor.
Read about it tomorrow.

689
00:46:13,558 --> 00:46:16,557
Mike, some day you'll wake up
and find your typewriter smashed.

690
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:19,157
Throw the referee out!

691
00:46:20,757 --> 00:46:24,158
I'm Mrs. Hagen.
Mike is forgetful sometimes.

692
00:46:24,357 --> 00:46:27,557
- It's a pleasure. I'm Martin Daylor.
- How do you do?

693
00:46:28,158 --> 00:46:30,957
Martin Daylor?
I know I've seen that name someplace.

694
00:46:31,757 --> 00:46:34,957
Aren't you the man
Mike's been writing about in his column?

695
00:46:36,157 --> 00:46:37,357
I'm the man.

696
00:46:37,558 --> 00:46:40,157
- I hope you enjoy the fights, Mrs. Hagen.
- Thank you.

697
00:46:40,557 --> 00:46:42,157
- Good night.
- Good night.

698
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:47,757
How did I know?
He certainly doesn't look like a crook.

699
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:49,557
I'd never take him for a crook.

700
00:46:49,757 --> 00:46:51,557
How many crooks have you known?

701
00:46:51,957 --> 00:46:54,557
A new side of Mike. A man in a huff.

702
00:46:55,557 --> 00:46:58,757
He didn't want to talk,
so I had to watch the fight, too.

703
00:46:59,357 --> 00:47:00,558
It was awful.

704
00:47:00,957 --> 00:47:04,557
One of the men, the older one,
was being punched constantly.

705
00:47:06,758 --> 00:47:10,557
You wouldn't think they'd get hit so much
with those heavy gloves on.

706
00:47:10,557 --> 00:47:12,557
The gloves are to protect their hands.

707
00:47:12,557 --> 00:47:14,557
Mike, sarcasm doesn't become you.

708
00:47:14,557 --> 00:47:17,358
No, it's true.
The gloves are to protect their hands.

709
00:47:17,557 --> 00:47:19,957
All right, if that's the way you want to be.

710
00:47:23,957 --> 00:47:25,757
I don't think I like fights.

711
00:47:27,157 --> 00:47:28,758
A lot of people do.

712
00:47:28,957 --> 00:47:31,758
Not all of them.
To some people it's very boring.

713
00:47:32,157 --> 00:47:33,157
Boring?

714
00:47:33,357 --> 00:47:35,958
Look at those people.
They're reading newspapers.

715
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:40,557
They're not reading.

716
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:43,557
They hold them that way
in case the blood splatters.

717
00:47:43,557 --> 00:47:45,358
That was all I needed.

718
00:47:51,157 --> 00:47:53,157
Mike, take me out of here.

719
00:48:16,157 --> 00:48:19,957
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm sorry, Mike.

720
00:48:19,957 --> 00:48:21,157
That's all right.

721
00:48:21,157 --> 00:48:23,557
Come summer,
I'll take you to the tennis matches.

722
00:48:23,557 --> 00:48:25,757
- Mike, boy.
- Not now, Charlie.

723
00:48:25,757 --> 00:48:29,557
Mike, I got a little something for you.
Got a slice of information.

724
00:48:29,557 --> 00:48:31,757
- Tomorrow.
- It's a very warm slice, Mike.

725
00:48:31,757 --> 00:48:34,158
I could let you have it
for a Ulysses S. Grant.

726
00:48:34,158 --> 00:48:35,557
I haven't got...

727
00:48:35,757 --> 00:48:37,757
Two Andrew Jacksons might do the trick.

728
00:48:37,757 --> 00:48:39,957
- No.
- I got the shorts real bad, Mike.

729
00:48:39,957 --> 00:48:41,558
- No.
- How about a Lincoln?

730
00:48:41,558 --> 00:48:43,357
- Not even a Lincoln?
- Charlie...

731
00:48:43,357 --> 00:48:46,157
I'm desperate. Three Washingtons.

732
00:48:49,557 --> 00:48:52,357
Here. Now, go away, please.

733
00:48:52,357 --> 00:48:55,557
- Don't you even want the hot slice?
- No. Thanks, Charlie.

734
00:48:56,357 --> 00:48:58,557
Mike. You're people.

735
00:48:59,757 --> 00:49:02,157
- Who is he, Mike?
- That's Charlie Arneg.

736
00:49:02,757 --> 00:49:06,157
He's also known as "Charlie the Sneak."
He peddles information.

737
00:49:06,357 --> 00:49:09,157
- What kind of information?
- Any. Charlie's not fussy.

738
00:49:09,357 --> 00:49:12,758
What was all that talk about
Ulysses S. Grant and Andrew Jackson?

739
00:49:12,758 --> 00:49:14,958
Ulysses S. Grant is a $50 bill.

740
00:49:15,157 --> 00:49:17,357
- It is?
- It's got Grant's picture on it.

741
00:49:17,357 --> 00:49:19,557
Andrew Jackson's $20, Lincoln is $5...

742
00:49:19,757 --> 00:49:21,757
- Washington is $1 .
- That's right.

743
00:49:21,957 --> 00:49:23,957
Very interesting. But why does he do it?

744
00:49:24,158 --> 00:49:27,157
He's trying to get
into a Damon Runyon story, who knows?

745
00:49:28,957 --> 00:49:32,558
Mike, you're working. Go on back.
I'll wait right here.

746
00:49:32,758 --> 00:49:34,957
- No, no.
- Please, I'll be fine.

747
00:49:34,957 --> 00:49:37,758
I'm really perfectly fine. Now, you go on.

748
00:49:38,758 --> 00:49:40,958
Well, okay.

749
00:49:41,757 --> 00:49:44,158
I'll come back to see you between fights.

750
00:49:51,957 --> 00:49:54,757
- Hey, Mike.
- Larry, boy.

751
00:49:55,157 --> 00:49:57,157
- What's the matter, you quitting?
- No.

752
00:49:57,157 --> 00:49:59,357
- My place next week, okay?
- Okay.

753
00:49:59,758 --> 00:50:02,157
That's Larry Musso. You'll meet him.

754
00:50:02,157 --> 00:50:05,357
I invited the regular crowd
for poker next Wednesday.

755
00:50:05,357 --> 00:50:06,557
Wednesday?

756
00:50:08,158 --> 00:50:12,158
- Anything wrong with that?
- No. That's fine. Just fine.

757
00:50:12,557 --> 00:50:14,757
The show crowd was coming
that night, too.

758
00:50:16,157 --> 00:50:19,757
It started out a bad evening,
and worsened steadily.

759
00:50:25,957 --> 00:50:27,958
Play cards. Play cards.

760
00:50:31,557 --> 00:50:34,158
- What are they doing in there?
- Reading a play.

761
00:50:34,357 --> 00:50:36,158
Who's reading it, Jack Benny?

762
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:39,358
"Ronnie appears at the top of the steps:

763
00:50:39,557 --> 00:50:41,757
'Aunt Agatha, she's done it again."'

764
00:50:42,358 --> 00:50:44,357
Boy, this is one I have to see.

765
00:50:44,357 --> 00:50:45,558
Play cards.

766
00:50:45,757 --> 00:50:47,957
This is where I want to do
the undersea ballet.

767
00:50:47,957 --> 00:50:49,758
You can't do an undersea ballet.

768
00:50:49,758 --> 00:50:50,557
Why not?

769
00:50:50,557 --> 00:50:52,958
Because you're still
in the drawing room set.

770
00:50:52,958 --> 00:50:54,958
- It has doors, doesn't it?
- Yes, but...

771
00:50:54,958 --> 00:50:58,357
That's all we need.
Behind closed doors anything can happen.

772
00:50:58,557 --> 00:51:00,357
It's the basis of all my work.

773
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:03,358
The entrance of the unexpected.
A closed door.

774
00:51:03,557 --> 00:51:06,157
When this door opens,
anything can come through.

775
00:51:09,757 --> 00:51:10,957
Sea horses.

776
00:51:28,757 --> 00:51:30,358
I'll get the sandwiches.

777
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:32,157
Aces.

778
00:51:39,957 --> 00:51:42,557
- How's the game going, dear?
- Yeah.

779
00:51:43,157 --> 00:51:47,357
- Did you want something?
- Well, yeah. The food, if it's ready.

780
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:49,557
I'm sure it is.

781
00:51:57,957 --> 00:51:59,957
- Everybody ante?
- I'm in.

782
00:52:01,757 --> 00:52:03,957
I'll get it. You go and play, dear.

783
00:52:04,557 --> 00:52:06,157
Fred deals the cards.

784
00:52:11,757 --> 00:52:15,158
- Mike Hagen live here? The poker game.
- Mike Hagen? Yes.

785
00:52:15,357 --> 00:52:18,158
Thank you. My name's Maxie Stulz.
I'm his best friend.

786
00:52:18,358 --> 00:52:20,358
Yes. Mike.

787
00:52:20,358 --> 00:52:22,157
- You Mrs. Hagen, lady?
- Yes...

788
00:52:22,157 --> 00:52:24,957
Then I'll tell you something.
Don't worry, you know?

789
00:52:25,157 --> 00:52:27,758
Any time anybody make trouble,
you tell Maxie Stulz.

790
00:52:27,758 --> 00:52:29,758
I take care of him good, right?

791
00:52:29,758 --> 00:52:33,557
So you got nothing to worry about.
Nothing, right? Where's the game?

792
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:34,958
In there.

793
00:52:38,357 --> 00:52:40,757
- Hello, boys.
- Hi, Maxie.

794
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,158
How you been? Glad you could make it.

795
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:46,358
I feel pretty good, Mr. Hagen.
I'm making a comeback, you know.

796
00:52:46,358 --> 00:52:48,358
You're the boy that can do it, Maxie.

797
00:52:48,358 --> 00:52:50,957
And Solly Horzmann's gonna manage me,
right, Solly?

798
00:52:50,957 --> 00:52:53,357
Sure, like I told you. Sit down, Maxie.

799
00:52:54,957 --> 00:52:56,357
- Deal me in.
- Okay.

800
00:53:00,557 --> 00:53:01,958
Who is he?

801
00:53:02,158 --> 00:53:04,557
- Who?
- That man with no nose.

802
00:53:04,757 --> 00:53:07,957
- He has a nose. It's inside.
- But who is he?

803
00:53:08,158 --> 00:53:12,757
That's Maxie Stulz. He used to be
middleweight champ. He's punchy.

804
00:53:12,957 --> 00:53:14,357
- What?
- Punchy. Punch-drunk.

805
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:18,357
We let him sit in for a couple of hands
every Wednesday. We make sure he wins.

806
00:53:18,357 --> 00:53:20,957
- It takes care of his room rent.
- That's very sweet.

807
00:53:20,957 --> 00:53:22,958
He's not going to hit anybody, is he?

808
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:24,958
- Why would he hit anybody?
- I don't know.

809
00:53:25,157 --> 00:53:28,557
Told me not to worry about trouble.
I don't know what not to worry about.

810
00:53:28,757 --> 00:53:31,158
- What is it?
- Nothing. I told you he's punchy.

811
00:53:31,158 --> 00:53:33,557
- Just forget it, will you?
- I'll try.

812
00:53:34,158 --> 00:53:35,757
Nice work, Maxie. Nice work.

813
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:37,957
How about that?
He wins on a pair of nines.

814
00:53:37,957 --> 00:53:41,558
- That's a pretty good hand, right?
- They don't come any better, Maxie.

815
00:53:41,558 --> 00:53:43,558
- We put you in for $5, Mike.
- Fine.

816
00:53:43,558 --> 00:53:45,957
I better go 'cause I got roadwork
in the morning.

817
00:53:45,957 --> 00:53:47,958
No, one more hand, come on.

818
00:53:53,757 --> 00:53:55,557
There are two possibilities....

819
00:53:55,757 --> 00:53:59,158
- Mike, can I see you for a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

820
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:00,757
Play cards!

821
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:03,757
Sorry, but where would you like to eat?
In here?

822
00:54:03,957 --> 00:54:06,757
Sure, anyplace. What's that?

823
00:54:07,357 --> 00:54:10,357
It's one of Gwen's creations.
A "poker loaf," she calls it.

824
00:54:10,357 --> 00:54:13,758
Yeah, but, I asked for bologna
and cheese and stuff, you know?

825
00:54:13,758 --> 00:54:16,958
Well, it's all cheese
and there's bologna in the middle.

826
00:54:17,158 --> 00:54:17,958
Okay.

827
00:54:18,557 --> 00:54:19,957
They don't seem to be going.

828
00:54:20,158 --> 00:54:23,757
Let's just take the food and the poker table
and move them to the study.

829
00:54:23,757 --> 00:54:26,557
- Then you won't be disturbed, all right?
- Fine.

830
00:54:26,957 --> 00:54:29,357
Give me a hand here,
we're gonna move in there.

831
00:54:29,357 --> 00:54:31,957
What for?
Come on, just pick up your stuff.

832
00:54:32,957 --> 00:54:34,957
Cream cheese and olives.

833
00:54:34,957 --> 00:54:38,157
Hey, you know, I tried one of those once.
Gave me gas.

834
00:54:38,958 --> 00:54:40,958
I was reading an article the other day...

835
00:54:41,157 --> 00:54:43,958
...where you can buy these cutters
for card parties...

836
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:47,957
...and you can make sandwiches
in the shape of clubs, hearts, and spades.

837
00:54:47,957 --> 00:54:50,957
- Diamonds, too?
- Absolutely. You take this thing...

838
00:54:51,157 --> 00:54:53,558
If you don't like it, don't eat it. In there.

839
00:55:07,557 --> 00:55:08,557
I'm sorry.

840
00:55:10,357 --> 00:55:12,557
These people here,
are they friends of Mike?

841
00:55:12,557 --> 00:55:14,358
Why, yes, of course.

842
00:55:14,557 --> 00:55:16,557
Nobody's gonna make trouble? I don't...

843
00:55:16,557 --> 00:55:18,558
No, they're close friends. Very close.

844
00:55:18,757 --> 00:55:21,157
That's good.
'Cause I don't like trouble, you know.

845
00:55:21,157 --> 00:55:23,957
Every time there's trouble, my head....
I don't like it.

846
00:55:23,957 --> 00:55:26,557
There's never any trouble around here.
Never.

847
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,958
Just put it over there by the table.
That's right. Thanks.

848
00:55:32,357 --> 00:55:35,357
- I had one fight too many, you know.
- I'm sorry.

849
00:55:35,557 --> 00:55:39,557
Yeah, I was fighting Tony Bleney and....
You see that eye?

850
00:55:40,557 --> 00:55:42,157
I got 16 stitches in that eye.

851
00:55:42,157 --> 00:55:45,957
In the eighth round, Tony opened it up
and the blood poured down. I couldn't see.

852
00:55:46,157 --> 00:55:47,957
In the tenth, he opened up the other eye.

853
00:55:47,957 --> 00:55:50,157
The blood came down
and I couldn't see at all.

854
00:55:50,357 --> 00:55:52,557
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Excuse me.

855
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:55,557
- Enough of that one. Let's try this.
- Come on, let's get going.

856
00:55:55,757 --> 00:55:58,158
You take a chair, I'll take the glasses.

857
00:56:03,158 --> 00:56:04,957
Maybe I'll be luckier in here.

858
00:56:05,757 --> 00:56:09,757
I don't want to move furniture.
I came here to play cards.

859
00:56:17,157 --> 00:56:19,157
By 12:00 everyone had gone.

860
00:56:19,557 --> 00:56:21,557
I had a feeling there might be words...

861
00:56:21,557 --> 00:56:25,158
...but I decided firmly
they would not originate with me.

862
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:30,358
Well, well. Six Washingtons.
What's that for?

863
00:56:31,157 --> 00:56:33,358
Sandwiches.
We split the expenses every week.

864
00:56:35,157 --> 00:56:37,157
If you play at a different house each week...

865
00:56:37,157 --> 00:56:39,557
...why doesn't the host take care
of the sandwiches?

866
00:56:39,557 --> 00:56:41,357
It would all even up in the end.

867
00:56:41,557 --> 00:56:43,958
We do it this way
because we like it this way.

868
00:56:44,157 --> 00:56:46,557
Yes, there were going to be words,
all right.

869
00:56:46,557 --> 00:56:49,357
It'll be done the same way
six weeks from tonight...

870
00:56:49,357 --> 00:56:51,557
...when the game comes around here again.

871
00:56:51,757 --> 00:56:53,158
So, in six weeks...

872
00:56:53,158 --> 00:56:56,358
...l'll have the pleasure of meeting
that man with no nose again.

873
00:56:56,358 --> 00:56:59,357
I was going to say so,
but repressed myself quickly.

874
00:56:59,558 --> 00:57:03,357
So, in six weeks I'll have the pleasure
of meeting that man with no nose again.

875
00:57:03,758 --> 00:57:08,357
What's the matter?
You have something against Maxie Stulz?

876
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:09,557
Of course not.

877
00:57:09,757 --> 00:57:12,557
He's a poor, unfortunate,
punchy-drunk man.

878
00:57:12,557 --> 00:57:14,557
I feel very sorry for him.

879
00:57:14,557 --> 00:57:17,557
But you could do better
by sending him to a good psychiatrist.

880
00:57:17,557 --> 00:57:21,358
I don't know a good psychiatrist,
but if I did, I might visit him myself...

881
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:22,757
...after this evening.

882
00:57:22,757 --> 00:57:26,558
So, it's out in the open, is it?
You don't like my friends.

883
00:57:26,757 --> 00:57:28,758
Well, I'm not bowled over.

884
00:57:28,758 --> 00:57:31,357
That's strange. They're so much like yours.

885
00:57:31,357 --> 00:57:33,958
- We're back on Maxie again.
- I never mentioned...

886
00:57:34,157 --> 00:57:37,158
I'll tell you one thing.
Nose or no nose, he's more of a man...

887
00:57:37,158 --> 00:57:39,158
...than Randy Owen who does....

888
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:41,557
Hello, Randy.

889
00:57:43,957 --> 00:57:46,557
- Did you forget something?
- My script.

890
00:57:48,558 --> 00:57:50,157
I'll get it.

891
00:58:00,757 --> 00:58:03,557
This is a picture of my wife
and my three sons.

892
00:58:03,757 --> 00:58:06,557
They're a little bigger now.
The oldest is about six feet.

893
00:58:06,757 --> 00:58:08,557
He plays football up in Maine.

894
00:58:08,757 --> 00:58:11,957
I'd be happy to have you
meet them sometime.

895
00:58:11,957 --> 00:58:16,357
And some other time, if you'd like,
I'd be happy to beat both your ears off.

896
00:58:16,558 --> 00:58:19,357
- Easy. Don't lose your head.
- Right now, if you'd like.

897
00:58:19,357 --> 00:58:20,758
Randy.

898
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:24,557
Randy, here's your script.

899
00:58:24,557 --> 00:58:26,958
- Good night, Marilla.
- Good night.

900
00:58:30,557 --> 00:58:32,158
Is he for real?

901
00:58:32,358 --> 00:58:34,757
- Did he mean that?
- I guess so.

902
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:37,957
He's something of a character, Randy.

903
00:58:39,357 --> 00:58:40,558
Character.

904
00:58:41,957 --> 00:58:44,758
He's punchier than Maxie Stulz.

905
00:58:53,357 --> 00:58:56,557
I wish Marilla hadn't decided
to make me her confidant.

906
00:58:57,557 --> 00:58:59,557
It's a thankless role at best.

907
00:58:59,557 --> 00:59:03,558
But when you're cast in it opposite a girl
you once asked to become your wife...

908
00:59:03,757 --> 00:59:05,757
...why, it's downright embarrassing.

909
00:59:05,757 --> 00:59:07,157
Do you like Mike?

910
00:59:09,157 --> 00:59:11,758
- Do you like Mike?
- Certainly I do.

911
00:59:12,557 --> 00:59:14,157
I don't know him very well...

912
00:59:14,357 --> 00:59:17,557
...but he seems an intelligent man.
Fairly easy temperament.

913
00:59:17,557 --> 00:59:19,757
Darned good writer,
I've read him for years.

914
00:59:19,957 --> 00:59:22,957
- Of course I like him, why do you ask?
- He hates you.

915
00:59:24,957 --> 00:59:27,358
It's not just you,
of course, it's all my friends.

916
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:30,757
So you know what? You're not coming up
to my place anymore.

917
00:59:32,758 --> 00:59:35,758
After all, we're a pretty neurotic bunch.

918
00:59:35,957 --> 00:59:37,758
Mike doesn't understand us.

919
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:41,157
Until he gets used to us,
I'm going to keep all of you away from him.

920
00:59:41,357 --> 00:59:44,158
- Protect him from our neuroses.
- That's right.

921
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:48,557
And Mike's not going to bring
some of his friends around, either.

922
00:59:48,957 --> 00:59:52,157
Neuroticism doesn't seem to be confined
to the artistic class.

923
00:59:52,358 --> 00:59:53,957
I'm relieved to hear that.

924
00:59:56,157 --> 00:59:57,957
- Yes?
- Miss Shannon is here.

925
00:59:58,357 --> 01:00:01,357
Ask her to come in.
This might be our leading lady.

926
01:00:01,557 --> 01:00:03,157
I want you to meet her.

927
01:00:05,157 --> 01:00:06,357
Hello, Mr. Wilde.

928
01:00:06,357 --> 01:00:07,757
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

929
01:00:07,757 --> 01:00:09,957
- Marilla Brown. Lori Shannon.
- Hello.

930
01:00:11,757 --> 01:00:13,358
How do you do, Miss Brown?

931
01:00:14,358 --> 01:00:17,757
- Have you two met?
- I'm sure we have. Haven't we?

932
01:00:19,558 --> 01:00:21,558
I was just trying to think.

933
01:00:22,157 --> 01:00:25,758
Well, anyway, you'll be a pleasure to dress.
You have a lovely figure.

934
01:00:25,957 --> 01:00:30,757
- Why, thank you. I'm a trifle long-waisted.
- Nothing we can't take care of.

935
01:00:30,958 --> 01:00:33,958
Luckily you're tiny in the hips
and your bust is perfect.

936
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:34,957
Well....

937
01:00:35,957 --> 01:00:39,757
I've got to run. I have 100 things to do
before my fashion show.

938
01:00:39,957 --> 01:00:43,157
It's been very nice.
Congratulations on getting the part.

939
01:00:43,157 --> 01:00:45,757
- I don't think I have yet.
- You will.

940
01:00:45,757 --> 01:00:48,357
Zach, you've got to. She's perfect.
Goodbye.

941
01:00:48,558 --> 01:00:49,357
Goodbye.

942
01:00:51,557 --> 01:00:54,157
I didn't know Marilla Brown
was designing your show.

943
01:00:54,157 --> 01:00:56,557
Yes, we're very lucky to get her.

944
01:00:56,958 --> 01:00:58,158
Yes.

945
01:01:16,557 --> 01:01:19,958
Don't ask me why I went
to Marilla's fashion show that afternoon.

946
01:01:20,157 --> 01:01:22,158
I must have been out of my head.

947
01:01:22,557 --> 01:01:24,357
You ever been to a fashion show?

948
01:01:24,357 --> 01:01:27,557
It's a sort of pagan ritual,
a ceremonial dance...

949
01:01:27,757 --> 01:01:30,957
...where the faithful sit around
sipping tea and worshipping clothes.

950
01:01:31,757 --> 01:01:33,558
There's a sacrifice involved, too.

951
01:01:33,757 --> 01:01:35,357
$1,500.

952
01:01:35,357 --> 01:01:37,957
$1,500 for a dress.

953
01:01:38,758 --> 01:01:40,957
$350 for a nightie, so help me.

954
01:01:42,357 --> 01:01:45,357
The high priestess at this slaughter
was my Marilla.

955
01:02:02,157 --> 01:02:04,557
Mike, you came.

956
01:02:05,758 --> 01:02:07,958
- I want to introduce you.
- No, I'd rather...

957
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:10,157
All right, we'll be exclusive.

958
01:02:18,557 --> 01:02:19,957
$850.

959
01:02:20,757 --> 01:02:22,157
What made you come?

960
01:02:22,157 --> 01:02:25,157
I don't know. I was working
and suddenly I had this hunch.

961
01:02:25,357 --> 01:02:27,957
A real hot flash, go to the Delsette store.

962
01:02:28,758 --> 01:02:31,357
No, I mean it,
it happens to me like that sometimes.

963
01:02:31,557 --> 01:02:32,758
Quick hunches.

964
01:02:33,557 --> 01:02:36,357
Feeling that something nice
is about to happen.

965
01:02:41,158 --> 01:02:42,358
Well, look at that!

966
01:02:42,957 --> 01:02:46,557
Zach, here.
That's Lori Shannon, she's in the show.

967
01:02:51,357 --> 01:02:52,957
- Miss Shannon.
- Hello.

968
01:02:52,957 --> 01:02:55,157
- Did we miss anything?
- No, you're on time.

969
01:02:55,157 --> 01:02:57,557
- How are you, Mike?
- Hello, Zach.

970
01:02:57,557 --> 01:03:00,357
Miss Shannon, this is my husband,
Michael Hagen.

971
01:03:00,357 --> 01:03:03,158
- How....
- How do you do, Mr. Hagen?

972
01:03:03,158 --> 01:03:04,757
It's so nice to meet you.

973
01:03:04,757 --> 01:03:06,957
- Won't you sit down here?
- Thank you.

974
01:03:11,957 --> 01:03:15,957
The chairs aren't very practical.
Miss Shannon, I wanted you to see this.

975
01:03:15,957 --> 01:03:17,357
How beautiful.

976
01:03:17,357 --> 01:03:19,758
Lori was going to play it
like we'd never met.

977
01:03:19,957 --> 01:03:20,957
Good.

978
01:03:20,957 --> 01:03:24,357
I sneaked a look at Marilla
to see if she'd noticed anything.

979
01:03:24,958 --> 01:03:26,357
Everything was okay.

980
01:03:26,958 --> 01:03:29,557
"So," I thought, "he knows her."

981
01:03:30,158 --> 01:03:33,358
I'm not naturally suspicious,
but this you couldn't miss.

982
01:03:38,358 --> 01:03:41,157
I see something like that for you
in the garden number.

983
01:03:41,157 --> 01:03:43,157
Slit up the sides
for more freedom in dance.

984
01:03:43,357 --> 01:03:45,157
- Don't you think so, Zach?
- Yes.

985
01:03:45,157 --> 01:03:47,557
By the way, Miss Shannon,
how are your legs?

986
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:50,557
- No complaints.
- I was sure there wouldn't be.

987
01:03:50,557 --> 01:03:52,757
I do think we ought
to see your legs in this.

988
01:03:53,158 --> 01:03:56,158
But not quite so revealing in the neckline.

989
01:03:56,357 --> 01:03:59,557
Although you've certainly got
nothing to worry about there.

990
01:04:05,157 --> 01:04:06,957
Are you all right, darling?

991
01:04:11,758 --> 01:04:15,557
I began to put two and two together.
It didn't take long.

992
01:04:15,757 --> 01:04:19,158
Two, the girl Mike feared
was about to spill tea in his lap...

993
01:04:19,557 --> 01:04:24,757
...and two, the girl who had spilled ravioli
in his lap, were one and the same spiller.

994
01:04:25,358 --> 01:04:26,757
Total, four.

995
01:04:48,757 --> 01:04:52,358
I still couldn't place
where l'd seen Lori Shannon.

996
01:05:18,558 --> 01:05:21,957
- How would you like to see her dressed?
- In splints!

997
01:05:48,357 --> 01:05:49,758
Hello, Mr. Hagen.

998
01:05:50,357 --> 01:05:51,958
Do you remember me?

999
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:56,157
- Yeah, you're Johnny O, aren't you?
- That's right, yeah.

1000
01:05:56,157 --> 01:05:57,958
I used to fight heavyweight.

1001
01:05:59,757 --> 01:06:00,557
Come in.

1002
01:06:04,757 --> 01:06:08,757
Nice place you got here, Mr. Hagen. Yeah.

1003
01:06:10,957 --> 01:06:12,157
Anybody home?

1004
01:06:13,157 --> 01:06:14,557
Just the maid.

1005
01:06:16,958 --> 01:06:20,357
It's Thursday, Mr. Hagen, she's off.

1006
01:06:22,357 --> 01:06:23,357
Yeah.

1007
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:29,358
Mr. Daylor told us to drop in.

1008
01:06:31,157 --> 01:06:33,157
He's angry at you, Mr. Hagen...

1009
01:06:33,957 --> 01:06:38,558
...for going on writing those stories
about him after he asked you not to.

1010
01:06:41,157 --> 01:06:44,357
What we're here for is not to hurt you
or anything like that.

1011
01:06:45,757 --> 01:06:49,557
It's more like a warning.
Yeah, friendly like, you know.

1012
01:07:00,957 --> 01:07:02,157
Leave him go.

1013
01:07:03,758 --> 01:07:07,357
Now, what I would suggest, Mr. Hagen,
is maybe from now on...

1014
01:07:07,557 --> 01:07:11,557
...you get after the basketball boys
and the wrestling and the horses.

1015
01:07:12,357 --> 01:07:14,557
They could stand a lot of cleaning up.

1016
01:07:15,158 --> 01:07:17,358
But you leave the fights alone or...

1017
01:07:17,757 --> 01:07:19,957
...they got to clean you up.

1018
01:07:20,757 --> 01:07:22,358
Do I make myself clear?

1019
01:07:24,157 --> 01:07:26,957
- I'll have that laundered for you.
- No, nothing at all.

1020
01:07:27,758 --> 01:07:30,357
Well, it was nice seeing you again,
Mr. Hagen.

1021
01:07:30,957 --> 01:07:33,557
I just hope we don't have to meet no more.

1022
01:07:40,957 --> 01:07:42,957
I didn't know you had friends.

1023
01:07:43,158 --> 01:07:45,557
This is Mr. Johnny O. My wife.

1024
01:07:46,157 --> 01:07:48,558
- How do you do?
- Nick and Eddie.

1025
01:07:48,757 --> 01:07:50,357
- How do you do?
- Hello.

1026
01:07:50,558 --> 01:07:52,558
What happened to your lip?

1027
01:07:54,357 --> 01:07:55,758
Just an accident.

1028
01:07:56,157 --> 01:08:00,157
Johnny O here was showing me
how he knocked out Bob Fitzsimmons.

1029
01:08:01,157 --> 01:08:05,957
- Boys, I hate to push you out.
- Sure. We was just going, Mr. Hagen.

1030
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:07,158
This way, boys.

1031
01:08:07,158 --> 01:08:09,158
- Mrs. Hagen.
- 'Bye, Mr. O.

1032
01:08:16,957 --> 01:08:18,357
So long, Mr. Hagen.

1033
01:08:20,557 --> 01:08:22,557
Nice of you boys to come by.

1034
01:08:24,757 --> 01:08:26,757
Mr. Hagen, remember:

1035
01:08:27,757 --> 01:08:30,557
No more articles about Mr. Daylor.

1036
01:08:41,957 --> 01:08:43,157
Is your lip all right?

1037
01:08:45,957 --> 01:08:46,958
It's fine.

1038
01:08:47,357 --> 01:08:50,557
People should be more careful.
He might have hurt you.

1039
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:53,357
Not Johnny O.

1040
01:08:54,557 --> 01:08:56,357
How did the rehearsal go?

1041
01:08:57,557 --> 01:09:00,358
I came home.

1042
01:09:00,557 --> 01:09:03,157
Listen, Mike,
there's something on my mind about us.

1043
01:09:03,157 --> 01:09:06,357
About me really,
because it happened before I met you.

1044
01:09:06,757 --> 01:09:09,557
But I don't believe in keeping things secret.

1045
01:09:10,758 --> 01:09:12,557
Before I met you there was a man.

1046
01:09:13,958 --> 01:09:16,757
- Zachary Wilde.
- Another man.

1047
01:09:17,557 --> 01:09:18,757
The boy from Yale.

1048
01:09:18,958 --> 01:09:21,757
He was nothing.
Neither was that artist I told you about.

1049
01:09:23,358 --> 01:09:25,557
I mean, another man.

1050
01:09:28,957 --> 01:09:31,157
Not that there was anything really wrong.

1051
01:09:32,558 --> 01:09:34,557
I'm sure of that.

1052
01:09:35,157 --> 01:09:37,758
I wanted to tell you anyway.
It's been on my mind.

1053
01:09:38,357 --> 01:09:42,158
And I believe in being frank
and aboveboard.

1054
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:48,957
If there's one thing
I've learned in this world...

1055
01:09:48,957 --> 01:09:53,157
...it's the exact moment
when not to be frank and aboveboard.

1056
01:09:53,957 --> 01:09:55,157
Okay, dear.

1057
01:09:57,157 --> 01:09:59,557
- What's for dinner?
- Lori Shannon!

1058
01:10:00,357 --> 01:10:01,357
For dinner?

1059
01:10:01,758 --> 01:10:04,958
You know what I'm talking about.
All that elaborate pretending.

1060
01:10:04,958 --> 01:10:07,557
"How do you do, Miss Shannon?"
"How do you do, Mr. Hagen?

1061
01:10:07,557 --> 01:10:08,757
So nice to meet you."

1062
01:10:08,757 --> 01:10:12,158
I introduced you. You let me
introduce you and all the time....

1063
01:10:12,158 --> 01:10:13,358
Wait. I didn't know....

1064
01:10:13,358 --> 01:10:14,757
Why didn't you tell me about her?

1065
01:10:14,957 --> 01:10:16,757
- What's the big secret?
- I don't know...

1066
01:10:16,757 --> 01:10:18,757
No! You didn't say a word.

1067
01:10:18,957 --> 01:10:20,357
What are you talking about?

1068
01:10:20,357 --> 01:10:22,558
You let me find out for myself
while everyone...

1069
01:10:22,558 --> 01:10:23,957
...is laughing behind my back.

1070
01:10:24,157 --> 01:10:26,758
- You're not making sense.
- I'm making excellent sense.

1071
01:10:26,758 --> 01:10:29,357
Lori Shannon. She's the girl in your show.

1072
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:31,557
That we already know.

1073
01:10:32,357 --> 01:10:36,158
What else is she or was she, or is she?

1074
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:38,957
- Lori Shannon. Are you out of your mind?
- The picture.

1075
01:10:39,158 --> 01:10:40,157
What picture?

1076
01:10:40,157 --> 01:10:43,558
The picture in your apartment.
I recognized her from that picture.

1077
01:10:43,558 --> 01:10:45,157
- Lori Shannon?
- Who else?

1078
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:46,757
- In my apartment?
- In your apartment!

1079
01:10:46,957 --> 01:10:49,157
Where's the picture? Show me the picture.

1080
01:10:49,357 --> 01:10:50,357
I tore it up.

1081
01:10:50,557 --> 01:10:52,157
You tore....

1082
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:56,557
- In a law court...
- We're not in a law court yet.

1083
01:10:56,557 --> 01:10:59,557
Just because you happen to find
a picture of a girl....

1084
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:04,957
You found a picture of a girl
in my apartment?

1085
01:11:05,157 --> 01:11:09,357
Not a girl. Lori Shannon.
You knew her. Why didn't you say so?

1086
01:11:09,558 --> 01:11:10,957
Lori Shannon.

1087
01:11:10,957 --> 01:11:14,157
That day at that style show,
she walked in, right?

1088
01:11:14,157 --> 01:11:18,357
I never saw her in my life.
If she knew me, why didn't she say so?

1089
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:20,157
Now who's not making sense?

1090
01:11:20,157 --> 01:11:24,357
If you'd listen a second, just because
you happened to find a picture...

1091
01:11:24,957 --> 01:11:26,158
I'm sorry.

1092
01:11:29,158 --> 01:11:33,558
How is it that you cannot stand
the sight of blood on anyone except me?

1093
01:11:42,958 --> 01:11:44,557
Mike, I want to talk to you.

1094
01:11:45,757 --> 01:11:48,757
- Excuse me, I'm due at the office.
- We've got to settle this.

1095
01:11:48,958 --> 01:11:51,357
Listen, I want to talk to you. You just....

1096
01:11:53,557 --> 01:11:55,757
That settles it.
Forget all about Mart Daylor.

1097
01:11:55,757 --> 01:11:57,157
- Forget him?
- Forget him.

1098
01:11:57,358 --> 01:12:00,957
You're a lousy newspaperman, but you're
not worth a nickel lying in an alley.

1099
01:12:01,757 --> 01:12:05,557
I've been after Daylor for two years.
I need a couple of weeks to finish the job.

1100
01:12:05,557 --> 01:12:08,758
Three, at the outside.
I've got affidavits coming in.

1101
01:12:09,157 --> 01:12:09,958
All right.

1102
01:12:10,557 --> 01:12:14,357
You want to dig your own grave?
I'll lend you a shovel. Only on my terms.

1103
01:12:14,357 --> 01:12:18,158
I'll give you three weeks, not a day more.
We'll find you someplace to hide.

1104
01:12:18,358 --> 01:12:20,358
The Gage Hotel around the corner.

1105
01:12:20,358 --> 01:12:22,358
We'll dateline your stories
from out of town.

1106
01:12:22,358 --> 01:12:23,757
You're following the Yankees.

1107
01:12:23,757 --> 01:12:26,757
Only you won't be there,
so the bullies can't catch up to you.

1108
01:12:26,957 --> 01:12:30,157
Meanwhile,
lay it on Daylor with everything you got.

1109
01:12:30,357 --> 01:12:35,557
Also, meanwhile, you're not to set one foot
out of that hotel room for three weeks.

1110
01:12:35,557 --> 01:12:36,357
Agreed?

1111
01:12:36,557 --> 01:12:38,557
- What will I tell my wife?
- The truth.

1112
01:12:38,557 --> 01:12:41,158
That I'm on the lam from the mob?
She will faint.

1113
01:12:41,158 --> 01:12:43,957
Don't tell me your problems.
I'm no marriage counselor.

1114
01:12:43,957 --> 01:12:45,957
Go on. Get out of here and get packed.

1115
01:12:46,157 --> 01:12:48,558
I'll send a copyboy every day
to pick up your stuff.

1116
01:12:48,757 --> 01:12:51,157
And don't answer the phone
no matter what.

1117
01:12:51,357 --> 01:12:54,157
One more thing, you'll need
somebody around for protection.

1118
01:12:54,157 --> 01:12:57,557
Is Maxie Stulz still around?
He is. Fine. Send him in.

1119
01:12:57,758 --> 01:13:00,557
Three weeks with Maxie Stulz,
I'll be punchier than he is.

1120
01:13:00,557 --> 01:13:02,158
- No!
- Shut up!

1121
01:13:02,357 --> 01:13:03,958
Maxie, come in here.

1122
01:13:04,158 --> 01:13:05,357
Hi, Mike.

1123
01:13:11,157 --> 01:13:13,757
Maxie, listen carefully.

1124
01:13:15,957 --> 01:13:18,957
There are some mugs in town...

1125
01:13:19,157 --> 01:13:21,357
...that don't like Mike Hagen.

1126
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:25,357
They want to hurt him. See?

1127
01:13:31,757 --> 01:13:35,557
There. That's the ticket, Maxie.
That's the ticket. You protect him, see.

1128
01:13:35,557 --> 01:13:37,358
You protect....

1129
01:13:37,757 --> 01:13:39,757
Maxie, listen!

1130
01:13:41,357 --> 01:13:45,758
You stay right next to Mike Hagen...

1131
01:13:46,758 --> 01:13:48,958
...day and night.

1132
01:13:49,357 --> 01:13:52,158
No matter where he goes.

1133
01:13:52,757 --> 01:13:54,557
Do you get it, Maxie?

1134
01:13:59,158 --> 01:14:01,757
That's the ticket.
Now, get him out of here.

1135
01:14:04,757 --> 01:14:07,558
Maxie, for the love of....

1136
01:14:12,958 --> 01:14:15,557
Maxie, will you let go
just for a minute, please...

1137
01:14:15,757 --> 01:14:18,158
...till I get some circulation? Thank you.

1138
01:14:18,158 --> 01:14:22,757
I going to protect you, Mr. Hagen?
I stay with you every minute, right?

1139
01:14:22,957 --> 01:14:23,557
Right.

1140
01:14:23,757 --> 01:14:27,157
- Anybody looks cross-eyed. Right?
- Right.

1141
01:14:28,157 --> 01:14:32,157
Anybody looks cross-eyed.
Anybody. Right?

1142
01:14:33,957 --> 01:14:35,957
- Right?
- Right!

1143
01:14:47,557 --> 01:14:49,358
- You looking cross-eyed?
- Maxie, no.

1144
01:14:49,557 --> 01:14:50,757
He looks cross-eyed.

1145
01:14:50,757 --> 01:14:53,957
He always looks like that.
He lost a horse. It affected his mind.

1146
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:57,157
Mike, I've been trying to reach....

1147
01:15:01,357 --> 01:15:03,758
- I believe you've met Maxie.
- Of course.

1148
01:15:04,757 --> 01:15:07,557
- How are you, Mr. Maxie?
- I'm making a comeback.

1149
01:15:09,757 --> 01:15:12,757
- Maxie came up from the office with me.
- How nice.

1150
01:15:17,757 --> 01:15:20,957
You'll think this is pretty strange
coming right at this time...

1151
01:15:20,957 --> 01:15:22,957
...but I have to leave for a while.

1152
01:15:22,957 --> 01:15:24,557
- Leave where?
- Here.

1153
01:15:26,758 --> 01:15:30,958
Well, I don't think that's strange at all.
Where are you going, to the club?

1154
01:15:30,958 --> 01:15:33,757
No, I'm not going to the club.
I don't belong to a club.

1155
01:15:33,757 --> 01:15:36,957
Something has come up.
Something very important.

1156
01:15:37,358 --> 01:15:39,557
I don't want you to be upset, but....

1157
01:15:40,358 --> 01:15:43,757
Well, you see, I'd like....

1158
01:15:44,157 --> 01:15:47,157
Maxie, will you stand over there
for a minute?

1159
01:15:47,157 --> 01:15:49,157
Please? Thank you.

1160
01:15:50,557 --> 01:15:53,958
I'd like to take you into my confidence.
May I do that?

1161
01:15:54,157 --> 01:15:57,557
- That would be a novelty.
- Please, let's not assume attitudes.

1162
01:15:57,557 --> 01:16:00,957
As far as that matter is concerned,
I don't even want to discuss it.

1163
01:16:00,957 --> 01:16:03,158
This other thing is too important.

1164
01:16:03,557 --> 01:16:06,557
- Can you keep a secret?
- Not as well as you can.

1165
01:16:09,757 --> 01:16:13,157
Okay. Excuse me, I've got to pack.

1166
01:16:17,557 --> 01:16:19,357
Excuse me, lady, got to pack.

1167
01:16:23,357 --> 01:16:25,357
I still don't know where you're going.

1168
01:16:25,757 --> 01:16:27,957
Chicago. Then on the road.

1169
01:16:27,957 --> 01:16:29,158
For how long?

1170
01:16:29,757 --> 01:16:32,757
Three weeks.
I'm going to follow the Yankees.

1171
01:16:32,957 --> 01:16:35,957
Is that the big secret?
You're going to follow the Yankees?

1172
01:16:36,157 --> 01:16:38,157
Yeah, they shouldn't know about it.

1173
01:16:41,157 --> 01:16:44,157
Mike, can I talk to you alone, please?

1174
01:16:44,157 --> 01:16:45,357
Well, what about?

1175
01:16:45,357 --> 01:16:47,958
You know what about. I want to....

1176
01:16:48,958 --> 01:16:51,557
- How have you been, Mr. Maxie?
- He's been fine.

1177
01:16:51,557 --> 01:16:53,557
I was conversing with Mr. Maxie.

1178
01:16:53,757 --> 01:16:56,557
Mr. Maxie doesn't know
what you're talking about.

1179
01:16:56,557 --> 01:17:00,157
You're packing a shoe with a hole.
You only wear these when you're writing.

1180
01:17:00,357 --> 01:17:02,357
I'll be doing some writing on the road.

1181
01:17:07,557 --> 01:17:09,958
Maxie, please.

1182
01:17:14,357 --> 01:17:16,557
It was pretty obvious, this sudden trip.

1183
01:17:16,557 --> 01:17:19,757
And bringing Mr. Maxie home
so he wouldn't have to talk.

1184
01:17:20,757 --> 01:17:23,157
I decided to pump Mr. Maxie.

1185
01:17:24,757 --> 01:17:26,757
Well, Mr. Maxie.

1186
01:17:28,157 --> 01:17:30,957
Are you taking Mike to the plane?

1187
01:17:31,157 --> 01:17:32,958
That's right. Every place.

1188
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:37,958
- Then you're not going with him.
- That's right. Every place.

1189
01:17:38,958 --> 01:17:41,557
Then you'll be following the Yankees, too?

1190
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:42,557
Who?

1191
01:17:43,957 --> 01:17:45,358
You. You and Mike.

1192
01:17:46,358 --> 01:17:50,757
That's right. Every second, day and night.
Anybody looks cross-eyed.

1193
01:17:50,757 --> 01:17:52,357
- Who?
- Cross-eyed.

1194
01:17:52,357 --> 01:17:53,758
Shut up, Maxie.

1195
01:17:57,557 --> 01:18:00,357
I'll call you tomorrow,
as soon as I know what hotel.

1196
01:18:00,357 --> 01:18:01,757
Let's go, Maxie.

1197
01:18:06,357 --> 01:18:07,757
So long, Marilla.

1198
01:18:13,558 --> 01:18:15,157
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1199
01:18:16,757 --> 01:18:21,157
- I hope you two will be very happy.
- Thank you very much.

1200
01:18:27,357 --> 01:18:31,357
- Mr. Higginsbury and Mr...
- Mr. Smith.

1201
01:18:34,757 --> 01:18:36,358
How do you spell "Smith"?

1202
01:18:36,757 --> 01:18:39,957
- Make a cross. Keys, please.
- Okay.

1203
01:18:42,157 --> 01:18:43,357
Suite 406.

1204
01:18:48,357 --> 01:18:49,757
How do you do, miss?

1205
01:18:50,357 --> 01:18:52,757
I'll place a few local calls now and then...

1206
01:18:52,757 --> 01:18:55,158
...but I'd like the party to think
I'm out of town.

1207
01:18:55,158 --> 01:18:58,957
So you say that Chicago is calling,
or Kansas City, or whatever I tell you.

1208
01:18:58,957 --> 01:19:00,157
Understand?

1209
01:19:01,358 --> 01:19:02,157
No.

1210
01:19:04,558 --> 01:19:06,157
That make it any clearer?

1211
01:19:08,558 --> 01:19:09,758
- Yes.
- Good.

1212
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:22,358
My first night away from Marilla
since we were married. I couldn't sleep.

1213
01:19:22,757 --> 01:19:26,157
Four times I picked up the phone
to make a clean breast of everything...

1214
01:19:26,157 --> 01:19:28,757
...and four times saner judgment prevailed.

1215
01:19:29,558 --> 01:19:33,157
Here I was, happily married
to the loveliest creature in New York.

1216
01:19:33,157 --> 01:19:37,357
And here I was, shacked up in a hotel
with a punchy ex-middleweight.

1217
01:19:37,557 --> 01:19:39,557
I began to hate Ned Hammerstein.

1218
01:19:39,958 --> 01:19:42,557
Maxie Stulz was no cure
for the blues either.

1219
01:19:42,557 --> 01:19:45,757
3:00 in the morning and all he did
was stare at the ceiling.

1220
01:19:46,158 --> 01:19:50,157
Suddenly, I remembered.
He'd been staring like that since 1 1:30.

1221
01:19:51,757 --> 01:19:53,157
I realized it then.

1222
01:19:54,157 --> 01:19:55,357
Maxie had died!

1223
01:20:03,157 --> 01:20:07,158
Okay, Maxie. It's okay. It's okay, Maxie.

1224
01:20:07,757 --> 01:20:10,757
- Stop!
- Where? Who? Cross-eyed?

1225
01:20:10,757 --> 01:20:14,557
It's all right, boy. It's okay.
Nothing. Forget it. All right.

1226
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:35,757
Circle seven, zero, five, nine, eight.

1227
01:20:41,157 --> 01:20:41,957
- Hello.
- Ned?

1228
01:20:42,157 --> 01:20:43,558
Yeah. Mike?

1229
01:20:43,957 --> 01:20:45,357
I just wanted to tell you.

1230
01:20:45,957 --> 01:20:49,157
Maxie Stulz sleeps with his eyes open.

1231
01:20:49,957 --> 01:20:51,157
Why, you crumb!

1232
01:20:51,357 --> 01:20:53,157
You thieving, no good...

1233
01:20:55,757 --> 01:20:57,158
What was that?

1234
01:21:00,757 --> 01:21:03,158
Maxie Stulz sleeps with his eyes open.

1235
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:05,957
Thanks for a civil answer.

1236
01:21:10,957 --> 01:21:12,558
Our first night apart.

1237
01:21:13,357 --> 01:21:15,957
I didn't know
a person could be so miserable.

1238
01:21:16,758 --> 01:21:20,157
By 3:00 a.m., I had convinced myself
that Mike was innocent.

1239
01:21:20,357 --> 01:21:23,158
After all,
maybe he had never known Lori Shannon.

1240
01:21:23,557 --> 01:21:27,957
Maybe the whole thing was a mistake.
That's what it was, a horrible mistake.

1241
01:21:29,158 --> 01:21:31,157
Only what about the photograph?

1242
01:21:31,957 --> 01:21:34,157
All right, what about the photograph?

1243
01:21:34,357 --> 01:21:37,957
A man can have a picture of a woman
without knowing her, can't he?

1244
01:21:38,157 --> 01:21:40,758
No. Then put it this way:

1245
01:21:41,557 --> 01:21:44,357
Mike is a newspaperman,
he meets all kinds of people.

1246
01:21:44,557 --> 01:21:47,357
He could've met Miss Shannon
in a purely business fashion.

1247
01:21:47,357 --> 01:21:48,757
Purely business.

1248
01:21:49,158 --> 01:21:52,158
Sure, but Miss Shannon
is no hockey player.

1249
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:53,557
Shut up.

1250
01:21:58,358 --> 01:22:02,558
My mind began drawing nasty
little pictures of Mike and Lori Shannon.

1251
01:22:03,758 --> 01:22:06,157
I saw them laughing together
in some restaurant.

1252
01:22:06,357 --> 01:22:10,557
I saw them out dancing.
I saw him bringing her home.

1253
01:22:11,157 --> 01:22:13,557
I saw him take her into the living room.

1254
01:22:14,158 --> 01:22:16,357
I saw him kiss her.

1255
01:22:17,757 --> 01:22:20,157
I saw him....

1256
01:22:21,957 --> 01:22:24,357
"But when you've got love, you're high

1257
01:22:24,558 --> 01:22:27,758
And your song is a gay refrain.

1258
01:22:27,957 --> 01:22:31,958
A happy strain that sings out the news.

1259
01:22:32,557 --> 01:22:35,357
Don't let the night go to waste

1260
01:22:35,557 --> 01:22:36,958
looking for ways

1261
01:22:36,958 --> 01:22:41,357
to say I love you.
Take your cue from the birds"

1262
01:22:41,757 --> 01:22:43,957
What would happen if I quit the show?

1263
01:22:44,557 --> 01:22:45,757
I'd shoot myself.

1264
01:22:46,358 --> 01:22:51,357
Listen, Madame X, as I understand it,
your Michael has departed for Chicago...

1265
01:22:51,357 --> 01:22:53,157
...firmly protesting his innocence.

1266
01:22:53,157 --> 01:22:55,157
What does that prove? Nothing.

1267
01:22:56,157 --> 01:22:59,757
"Music is better than words"

1268
01:23:04,957 --> 01:23:07,557
Not bad, sweetie.
Go to your room and I'll clean it up.

1269
01:23:07,557 --> 01:23:11,557
All the four parts right over here.
Take it from just before the circle.

1270
01:23:16,357 --> 01:23:18,758
What have you proved? Also nothing.

1271
01:23:18,758 --> 01:23:20,357
I admit I could be wrong.

1272
01:23:20,357 --> 01:23:23,758
I just can't stand not knowing.
And I certainly can't ask her.

1273
01:23:23,758 --> 01:23:26,757
"Pardon me, Miss Shannon,
but was my husband in love with you?"

1274
01:23:26,757 --> 01:23:29,158
- It's unthinkable.
- Definitely.

1275
01:23:29,158 --> 01:23:31,557
- So I have an idea.
- What?

1276
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:32,957
- You ask her.
- No.

1277
01:23:32,957 --> 01:23:34,358
You can do it.

1278
01:23:34,358 --> 01:23:37,757
All you have to do is broach the subject
as tastefully as possible.

1279
01:23:37,757 --> 01:23:40,957
Find out if she ever knew him,
and then tell me about it.

1280
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:45,357
Marilla, deceit and collusion are completely
out of tune with your character.

1281
01:23:45,557 --> 01:23:49,157
I know it, but please, Zach,
I can't go on working like this.

1282
01:23:51,757 --> 01:23:54,357
- I'll speak to her right away.
- Thank you.

1283
01:24:07,957 --> 01:24:08,758
Yes?

1284
01:24:13,357 --> 01:24:14,757
Come in, Mr. Wilde.

1285
01:24:15,157 --> 01:24:17,757
- Am I disturbing you?
- Not at all.

1286
01:24:24,158 --> 01:24:26,358
- May I?
- By all means.

1287
01:24:28,157 --> 01:24:30,157
Miss Shannon, this is...

1288
01:24:30,558 --> 01:24:32,157
...rather a delicate matter.

1289
01:24:34,758 --> 01:24:36,557
You see, I hate to intrude.

1290
01:24:37,557 --> 01:24:39,357
Playful little fellow, isn't he?

1291
01:24:39,557 --> 01:24:41,357
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

1292
01:24:41,357 --> 01:24:42,557
Come along now.

1293
01:24:42,958 --> 01:24:45,557
Over here, 'cause you're a naughty dog.
Right, now sit.

1294
01:24:45,757 --> 01:24:47,158
That's a good boy.

1295
01:24:47,957 --> 01:24:50,757
Miss Shannon,
I'm usually a man of quite a few words...

1296
01:24:50,957 --> 01:24:54,357
...but I'll try and make this
as brief and tactful as possible.

1297
01:24:54,357 --> 01:24:55,157
Yes.

1298
01:24:56,558 --> 01:24:58,758
What I have to ask
has nothing whatsoever to do...

1299
01:24:58,758 --> 01:25:01,758
...with this show
or our future business relationship.

1300
01:25:01,958 --> 01:25:04,157
- I want you to understand that.
- Yes.

1301
01:25:04,357 --> 01:25:05,557
Miss Shannon...

1302
01:25:05,557 --> 01:25:08,958
...I'd like to know,
and please answer very frankly...

1303
01:25:09,158 --> 01:25:12,557
...if I may feel free to call on you
at your apartment...

1304
01:25:13,158 --> 01:25:17,157
...and take you to dinner
as often as the spirit moves us both?

1305
01:25:17,957 --> 01:25:20,558
In time, as you learn to know me better...

1306
01:25:20,558 --> 01:25:23,157
...I hope our friendship
will ripen into something...

1307
01:25:23,357 --> 01:25:25,957
...shall we say more neighborly?

1308
01:25:28,758 --> 01:25:30,357
You don't have to answer now.

1309
01:25:31,557 --> 01:25:32,958
I'd be delighted.

1310
01:25:41,957 --> 01:25:43,558
8:30 tonight?

1311
01:25:53,557 --> 01:25:56,357
- Well?
- I asked her point-blank.

1312
01:25:56,357 --> 01:25:58,757
Miss Shannon never laid eyes
on your husband...

1313
01:25:58,757 --> 01:26:00,957
...until that day at the fashion show.

1314
01:26:01,757 --> 01:26:02,957
Feel better?

1315
01:26:11,957 --> 01:26:15,957
Is this Mrs. Hagen?
Just a moment, please. Chicago calling.

1316
01:26:16,958 --> 01:26:19,157
Hello, Marilla? This is Mike.

1317
01:26:20,157 --> 01:26:22,757
What do you mean, where am I?
I told you, I'm in Chicago.

1318
01:26:23,557 --> 01:26:25,357
What? What hotel?

1319
01:26:25,357 --> 01:26:28,358
We're at the Whitestone,
but we're leaving here tonight.

1320
01:26:29,358 --> 01:26:31,757
Well, why can't you talk now?
Who's there?

1321
01:26:32,957 --> 01:26:36,357
Zachary. Yeah, Zachary, sure.

1322
01:26:38,558 --> 01:26:40,557
The whole crowd, you're working.

1323
01:26:42,557 --> 01:26:45,958
The weather? The weather here?

1324
01:26:46,157 --> 01:26:49,158
Well, it's.... You know.

1325
01:26:50,158 --> 01:26:53,757
Hello, Marilla? I can't hear you.

1326
01:26:55,157 --> 01:26:58,957
Hello? Hello, Marilla.
Yeah, I can hear you now.

1327
01:27:00,157 --> 01:27:02,357
It's hot here. 92.

1328
01:27:03,758 --> 01:27:06,557
Well, I guess that's about all if you're busy.

1329
01:27:06,557 --> 01:27:08,357
I just wanted to say hello.

1330
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:10,357
Okay.

1331
01:27:12,158 --> 01:27:14,357
I'll call you again in a couple of days.

1332
01:27:15,357 --> 01:27:16,357
'Bye.

1333
01:27:17,757 --> 01:27:21,757
I don't like Chicago,
I got a bad decision here once.

1334
01:27:22,157 --> 01:27:25,157
It's all right, Maxie. You go to sleep.

1335
01:27:31,157 --> 01:27:33,557
Open your eyes and go to sleep.

1336
01:27:41,557 --> 01:27:42,757
I'm in Boston.

1337
01:27:46,358 --> 01:27:47,957
We just got in. Cleveland.

1338
01:27:52,157 --> 01:27:53,157
Kansas City.

1339
01:27:57,157 --> 01:28:00,557
Mike? I just read your stuff, it's great.

1340
01:28:01,157 --> 01:28:04,158
Keep your nose off the street.
You may win the Pulitzer Prize.

1341
01:28:04,357 --> 01:28:06,557
Stick it out and Daylor will bite it off.

1342
01:28:07,358 --> 01:28:09,757
Your job is to find Mike Hagen.

1343
01:28:10,157 --> 01:28:12,757
Who have you got working on it,
a troupe of clowns?

1344
01:28:12,757 --> 01:28:16,157
Clowns? In Chicago was Joey Golner.

1345
01:28:16,957 --> 01:28:18,558
This is not a good guy?

1346
01:28:19,557 --> 01:28:23,357
In Boston, it was three boys
with Louey Gasto, merely the best.

1347
01:28:23,758 --> 01:28:26,757
- In Kansas City...
- Never mind the excuses.

1348
01:28:27,158 --> 01:28:29,757
Just give us some action, Milt. Action.

1349
01:28:30,158 --> 01:28:32,158
You're wasting your time, Milt.

1350
01:28:33,757 --> 01:28:37,358
You're looking all over the place
and your eyes are in the way.

1351
01:28:37,558 --> 01:28:39,757
Hagen's not out of town, he's right here.

1352
01:28:39,957 --> 01:28:41,157
In New York?

1353
01:28:43,558 --> 01:28:44,957
What makes you think?

1354
01:28:45,957 --> 01:28:48,157
I'm guessing. And I'm guessing right.

1355
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:52,357
He's holed up somewhere
right under our noses.

1356
01:28:53,757 --> 01:28:57,158
- Trick is to bring him out in the open.
- Any ideas?

1357
01:28:57,757 --> 01:28:58,757
I think so.

1358
01:29:00,157 --> 01:29:03,358
Johnny, round up a couple of the boys
and be in my office tonight.

1359
01:29:03,558 --> 01:29:04,558
Let's go.

1360
01:29:05,558 --> 01:29:06,757
And, Johnny...

1361
01:29:08,558 --> 01:29:12,357
...I want real good boys. Playtime is over.

1362
01:29:15,958 --> 01:29:18,557
Hello, honey,
will you call that number again for me?

1363
01:29:18,557 --> 01:29:20,158
I'm in Detroit.

1364
01:29:22,757 --> 01:29:26,557
It's a nice town, Maxie.
Lots of automobiles, you'll love it.

1365
01:29:29,757 --> 01:29:31,757
Hello, Marilla? How are you?

1366
01:29:31,957 --> 01:29:34,557
This is Gwen, Mr. Hagen.
Mrs. Hagen isn't here.

1367
01:29:35,957 --> 01:29:37,157
When will she be back?

1368
01:29:37,557 --> 01:29:39,357
I don't know. She didn't say.

1369
01:29:39,557 --> 01:29:42,958
- Do you know where she went?
- No, I don't know where she went.

1370
01:29:43,958 --> 01:29:46,158
I'm here, I just don't want to talk.
Goodbye.

1371
01:29:46,158 --> 01:29:49,557
- Wait. What's going on?
- I'm packing, that's what's going on.

1372
01:29:49,757 --> 01:29:52,358
Packing? Where are you going?

1373
01:29:52,558 --> 01:29:55,157
Boston. The show's opening there
tomorrow night.

1374
01:29:55,357 --> 01:29:56,757
Yeah, the show.

1375
01:29:57,558 --> 01:30:01,557
You wouldn't happen to be going
to Boston tomorrow, by any chance?

1376
01:30:01,758 --> 01:30:05,157
- No, I wouldn't be.
- I was sure you wouldn't. Goodbye.

1377
01:30:05,357 --> 01:30:07,557
Marilla, will you stop? What's the matter?

1378
01:30:07,757 --> 01:30:11,757
It's funny you should ask that.
Why should anything be the matter?

1379
01:30:11,957 --> 01:30:14,158
I don't eat and I don't sleep...

1380
01:30:14,358 --> 01:30:16,757
...but outside of that
everything's just dandy.

1381
01:30:16,757 --> 01:30:18,558
Marilla, will you listen, please?

1382
01:30:18,558 --> 01:30:21,957
If you're still worried about Lori Shannon,
you've got it all wrong.

1383
01:30:22,157 --> 01:30:24,357
I wouldn't have cared
if only you'd have told me.

1384
01:30:24,557 --> 01:30:26,157
"How do you do, Miss Shannon?"

1385
01:30:27,357 --> 01:30:30,157
All right, I've had enough of this!
I'll ask her myself.

1386
01:30:30,958 --> 01:30:33,158
All right, Marilla. You do that!

1387
01:30:33,757 --> 01:30:34,757
I want you to!

1388
01:30:34,957 --> 01:30:36,357
I will. Goodbye.

1389
01:30:36,757 --> 01:30:37,957
Goodbye.

1390
01:30:52,557 --> 01:30:53,958
This ain't Detroit.

1391
01:30:55,757 --> 01:30:57,357
Looks more like Chicago.

1392
01:30:59,158 --> 01:31:01,357
Hey, Mr. Hagen, you punchy?

1393
01:31:02,158 --> 01:31:03,757
I'm going to do my best.

1394
01:31:06,157 --> 01:31:09,357
I had three quick ones
which did me no good at all.

1395
01:31:11,357 --> 01:31:16,958
But strangely enough, after the fourth,
I found the solution to the whole problem.

1396
01:31:17,958 --> 01:31:20,958
I would see Lori that night
and fix up a story.

1397
01:31:21,757 --> 01:31:25,158
Liquor, I have found, makes me very smart.

1398
01:31:26,957 --> 01:31:29,957
First, of course, I had to get rid of Maxie.

1399
01:31:34,357 --> 01:31:38,758
Boy, am I beat.
Let's hit the hay, Maxie. Sleep.

1400
01:32:21,757 --> 01:32:24,757
I was packing for Boston
when the bell rang.

1401
01:32:24,757 --> 01:32:27,758
"lt couldn't be," I thought, but it was.

1402
01:32:30,357 --> 01:32:31,958
- Hi.
- Hi.

1403
01:32:34,958 --> 01:32:38,757
I came up the stairs.
I didn't want the elevator boy....

1404
01:32:40,757 --> 01:32:42,957
Have you got a drink?

1405
01:32:45,358 --> 01:32:46,358
Thanks.

1406
01:32:51,757 --> 01:32:52,957
Not now, boy.

1407
01:32:56,758 --> 01:32:59,357
I guess you're sort of surprised to see me.

1408
01:33:01,557 --> 01:33:03,958
- Mind if I sit down?
- Please, do.

1409
01:33:08,358 --> 01:33:12,558
What I came about....
All right, boy, that's enough.

1410
01:33:13,157 --> 01:33:16,757
I came really because.... Will you stop?

1411
01:33:16,757 --> 01:33:20,157
There's something of the utmost
importance I have to discuss with you.

1412
01:33:20,557 --> 01:33:21,758
Not only....

1413
01:33:29,757 --> 01:33:31,757
This dog has very bad habits.

1414
01:33:31,957 --> 01:33:34,358
There was a time
when you thought it was funny.

1415
01:33:36,957 --> 01:33:38,757
My sense of humor has changed.

1416
01:33:40,558 --> 01:33:44,157
- I thought you were out of town.
- Yeah, a lot of people think so.

1417
01:33:44,357 --> 01:33:46,557
Including your old friend Mart Daylor?

1418
01:33:47,357 --> 01:33:50,958
I've been reading your column.
Where are you hiding out?

1419
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:52,958
The Gage Hotel. For three weeks.

1420
01:33:53,357 --> 01:33:56,557
- Your wife must be delighted.
- She doesn't know. I didn't tell her.

1421
01:33:56,557 --> 01:33:59,158
She thinks that.... Well, it's a big megillah.

1422
01:34:00,157 --> 01:34:01,358
I'll bet it is.

1423
01:34:01,358 --> 01:34:03,957
How's Marilla been acting lately
toward you?

1424
01:34:04,957 --> 01:34:06,157
About the same.

1425
01:34:06,357 --> 01:34:07,558
What does that mean?

1426
01:34:07,558 --> 01:34:09,758
I think she's getting ready to slug me.

1427
01:34:09,758 --> 01:34:11,557
That's why I'm here.

1428
01:34:11,958 --> 01:34:14,958
You see, Marilla found a picture of you.
And she thinks that....

1429
01:34:15,757 --> 01:34:17,757
Well, you know what she thinks. Anyway...

1430
01:34:17,958 --> 01:34:19,957
...she's going to ask you about us.

1431
01:34:19,957 --> 01:34:23,158
I've got a story all worked out.

1432
01:34:23,957 --> 01:34:26,757
This could be interesting.
How does it open?

1433
01:34:28,358 --> 01:34:30,357
You're a girl from Wisconsin.

1434
01:34:30,757 --> 01:34:32,357
Up to there it's very logical.

1435
01:34:32,758 --> 01:34:36,958
A friend of mine in Wisconsin,
a halfback on the Green Bay Packers...

1436
01:34:36,958 --> 01:34:38,958
- What's that?
- It's a football team.

1437
01:34:39,357 --> 01:34:41,157
He sent me a picture of you.

1438
01:34:41,357 --> 01:34:43,757
Asked me to use my influence
to get you a job.

1439
01:34:43,958 --> 01:34:46,357
You know, in radio, TV, anything. All right.

1440
01:34:46,957 --> 01:34:49,957
You came to my office. Once.

1441
01:34:50,757 --> 01:34:54,558
I told you that I was sorry,
there was nothing that I could do for you.

1442
01:34:54,957 --> 01:34:57,758
And that was the end of the whole affair.

1443
01:34:58,357 --> 01:35:01,157
But I forgot to throw out the picture...

1444
01:35:01,557 --> 01:35:04,157
...and that's how Marilla
happened to find it.

1445
01:35:07,158 --> 01:35:09,357
- Well?
- I don't believe it.

1446
01:35:09,557 --> 01:35:12,557
I don't expect you to believe it.
I want Marilla to believe it.

1447
01:35:12,557 --> 01:35:15,157
- She won't believe it either.
- Why?

1448
01:35:15,757 --> 01:35:18,757
I read something like it once
in a comic strip.

1449
01:35:19,357 --> 01:35:21,558
Even there they didn't believe it.

1450
01:35:26,557 --> 01:35:28,557
Hello? Yes?

1451
01:35:32,557 --> 01:35:34,357
Yeah, hello, Miss Brown.

1452
01:35:35,757 --> 01:35:38,757
Where? Why, of course.

1453
01:35:39,757 --> 01:35:43,157
Well, yes, I was in bed,
but that's perfectly...

1454
01:35:45,957 --> 01:35:48,357
Could you just give me a few minutes?

1455
01:35:48,957 --> 01:35:51,958
- Yes, all right.
- What?

1456
01:35:52,357 --> 01:35:53,758
She's in the lobby.

1457
01:35:53,958 --> 01:35:57,158
She went out without her purse
and she wants to borrow a cab fare.

1458
01:35:57,158 --> 01:35:59,957
You mean she's coming up?
Why didn't you stop her?

1459
01:35:59,957 --> 01:36:01,757
How? Tell her I didn't have $1?

1460
01:36:01,757 --> 01:36:03,957
She doesn't want $1 .
She wants to find out....

1461
01:36:03,957 --> 01:36:05,157
I'll go down the stairs.

1462
01:36:05,358 --> 01:36:08,957
Fine. If you run into her,
tell her about the Green Bay Packers.

1463
01:36:09,558 --> 01:36:10,757
Well, in here.

1464
01:36:11,558 --> 01:36:14,957
Listen, that story. It'll work. I know.
Just get your facts straight.

1465
01:36:14,957 --> 01:36:17,958
That fellow, Nordley was his name.
Frank Nordley.

1466
01:36:17,958 --> 01:36:20,958
He's a friend of yours.
The Green Bay Packers.

1467
01:36:22,958 --> 01:36:25,557
I've played this scene before, I thought.

1468
01:36:25,557 --> 01:36:28,158
In a blackout on the borscht circuit.

1469
01:36:35,757 --> 01:36:36,957
Hello.

1470
01:36:39,357 --> 01:36:41,157
What a sweet dog.

1471
01:36:42,357 --> 01:36:45,557
- This is the silliest thing. I'm terribly sorry.
- That's all right.

1472
01:36:45,757 --> 01:36:49,957
We were all working at Zach's tonight
and I decided the air would do me good...

1473
01:36:50,158 --> 01:36:54,358
...so I walked till I almost fell down
and there I was, no purse.

1474
01:36:55,157 --> 01:36:57,757
- I hope you weren't asleep.
- No.

1475
01:36:58,358 --> 01:37:02,157
What a lovely place you have.
Did you do it yourself?.

1476
01:37:02,758 --> 01:37:05,758
- Yes, it's about...
- I love your drapes.

1477
01:37:06,758 --> 01:37:08,557
What a beautiful chest.

1478
01:37:09,157 --> 01:37:10,557
Could I get you a drink?

1479
01:37:10,757 --> 01:37:13,158
No, thanks. I will have a cigarette though.

1480
01:37:13,158 --> 01:37:15,357
- Just there.
- Thank you.

1481
01:37:17,757 --> 01:37:19,358
I'll get my purse.

1482
01:37:19,757 --> 01:37:22,558
Some day I'm going to design a purse
you can't forget.

1483
01:37:22,558 --> 01:37:25,357
It'll have a little bell
or something that tinkles madly...

1484
01:37:25,558 --> 01:37:27,157
...whenever you leave it behind.

1485
01:37:27,357 --> 01:37:28,357
Good idea.

1486
01:37:28,558 --> 01:37:30,357
Will $5 be enough?

1487
01:37:30,557 --> 01:37:32,557
Heavens, yes. It's only a mile or so.

1488
01:37:32,557 --> 01:37:36,958
Thank you. You know,
I have a real phobia about taxi drivers.

1489
01:37:37,158 --> 01:37:39,557
I could've gone to the apartment
and asked him to wait.

1490
01:37:39,557 --> 01:37:41,158
But whenever I do that...

1491
01:37:41,158 --> 01:37:43,957
...I'm always afraid they'll think
I'm trying to cheat them.

1492
01:37:44,158 --> 01:37:45,957
Do you have a fear like that?

1493
01:37:52,357 --> 01:37:54,157
I could say I didn't know I had it.

1494
01:37:54,557 --> 01:37:57,958
But I'm a very bad liar, Miss Shannon.
I suppose you've noticed that.

1495
01:37:58,357 --> 01:38:00,958
Maybe you just haven't had
enough practice.

1496
01:38:08,358 --> 01:38:10,757
I came here tonight
for a very definite reason.

1497
01:38:11,157 --> 01:38:12,757
To ask you a question.

1498
01:38:13,358 --> 01:38:16,357
At the moment I feel like a fool,
so I've decided not to ask it.

1499
01:38:16,558 --> 01:38:18,758
Tonight or ever. I hope you'll forgive me.

1500
01:38:18,957 --> 01:38:20,157
- Of course.
- Thank you.

1501
01:38:20,557 --> 01:38:24,157
I must say,
you've been very understanding about this.

1502
01:38:24,557 --> 01:38:26,157
I really do appreciate it.

1503
01:38:32,557 --> 01:38:36,157
Furthermore, I'd like to apologize
for the way I've been acting lately.

1504
01:38:36,358 --> 01:38:39,558
- I don't think I've been aware of anything.
- Really?

1505
01:38:39,957 --> 01:38:42,558
You must've noticed
that twice during the last week...

1506
01:38:42,758 --> 01:38:45,957
...while pinning material on you
I've jabbed you in the derriere.

1507
01:38:46,357 --> 01:38:49,157
- That.
- I did it purposely.

1508
01:38:49,157 --> 01:38:50,557
Really?

1509
01:38:54,957 --> 01:38:58,757
Anyway, I'm sorry
and it won't happen again.

1510
01:38:59,158 --> 01:39:01,957
I had the silly idea
I was supposed to be jealous of you.

1511
01:39:02,157 --> 01:39:04,357
Thank heaven I've come to my senses.

1512
01:39:04,558 --> 01:39:07,157
Please try to forget
I ever came here tonight.

1513
01:39:18,557 --> 01:39:20,557
Marilla, what are you doing here?

1514
01:39:34,957 --> 01:39:37,357
There's no explanation
for what you did to me.

1515
01:39:37,357 --> 01:39:40,357
- I don't want to listen to you.
- Come back here now.

1516
01:39:40,357 --> 01:39:43,557
You're jumping to the wrong conclusions,
altogether.

1517
01:39:43,757 --> 01:39:46,158
You don't want a taxi. You're not getting...

1518
01:39:46,357 --> 01:39:48,158
Don't touch me! Take your hands off me!

1519
01:39:48,158 --> 01:39:51,557
You mustn't be deceived by appearances.
Appearances are very deceiving.

1520
01:39:51,557 --> 01:39:54,757
- I don't want to hear why.
- I was up there. Yes, but why?

1521
01:39:54,957 --> 01:39:57,758
Taxi. Taxi.

1522
01:39:58,558 --> 01:40:01,758
Just for once in your life,
will you listen to me? Marilla!

1523
01:40:03,958 --> 01:40:07,757
When you said you were going
to ask Lori Shannon about us...

1524
01:40:07,757 --> 01:40:09,557
...I just dropped over to see her.

1525
01:40:09,757 --> 01:40:10,757
From Detroit?

1526
01:40:10,757 --> 01:40:13,757
I haven't been in Detroit.
I've been in a hotel for two weeks.

1527
01:40:13,757 --> 01:40:17,157
Right here. Hiding out.
That's right, hiding out!

1528
01:40:17,358 --> 01:40:21,157
Have you been drinking?
Of course. A hotel drinker.

1529
01:40:21,558 --> 01:40:24,557
That's the way I met you.
That's the way I'm leaving you.

1530
01:40:24,758 --> 01:40:26,958
- Taxi. Taxi.
- Just a minute. Come back.

1531
01:40:26,958 --> 01:40:29,357
Will you let me go? I told you I hate that.

1532
01:40:29,557 --> 01:40:33,757
Don't get in that cab. Marilla!
Don't drive that cab away, I'm telling you.

1533
01:40:33,958 --> 01:40:36,357
- Don't drive it away. Stop!
- Taxi, drive on.

1534
01:40:36,757 --> 01:40:39,557
Come back. Marilla!

1535
01:40:42,157 --> 01:40:46,157
Officer, I've got plenty of troubles tonight.
I don't need any from you.

1536
01:40:48,957 --> 01:40:52,958
I'm a fighter, you know,
and a fighter needs lots of sleep.

1537
01:40:53,157 --> 01:40:56,757
So l'm sleeping in the bed,
and l'm dreaming like, you know.

1538
01:40:56,958 --> 01:40:59,158
But all of a sudden I wake up.

1539
01:41:01,557 --> 01:41:05,757
I look around.
I look in the bed for Mr. Hagen.

1540
01:41:06,157 --> 01:41:08,957
But he ain't there, so I don't see him.

1541
01:41:10,757 --> 01:41:15,758
So I think maybe he's in the parlor.
So I go in the parlor.

1542
01:41:16,557 --> 01:41:19,757
I look all around good, but I don't find him.

1543
01:41:20,557 --> 01:41:21,757
"Boy," I say.

1544
01:41:21,958 --> 01:41:22,958
Boy.

1545
01:41:23,158 --> 01:41:25,357
So I think maybe he go downstairs.

1546
01:41:25,957 --> 01:41:28,957
So I go down the stairs to the lobby, like.

1547
01:41:29,757 --> 01:41:31,957
And I don't find him no place.

1548
01:41:32,757 --> 01:41:34,157
"Holy smoke," I say.

1549
01:41:34,558 --> 01:41:35,558
Holy smoke.

1550
01:41:37,957 --> 01:41:41,758
- Aren't you Maxie Stulz?
- That's right, Maxie Stulz.

1551
01:41:41,958 --> 01:41:44,157
Don't you remember me, Charlie Arneg?

1552
01:41:44,557 --> 01:41:47,958
Yeah, sure, that's right.
Did you see Mr. Hagen, Charlie?

1553
01:41:47,958 --> 01:41:51,357
- No, Maxie, Mr. Hagen's in Detroit.
- Where?

1554
01:41:51,357 --> 01:41:53,957
Detroit. See?
It says right here in the paper.

1555
01:41:54,158 --> 01:41:55,757
"Mike Hagen is in Detroit."

1556
01:41:56,358 --> 01:41:58,957
- Where am I, Charlie?
- New York, Maxie.

1557
01:41:58,957 --> 01:42:02,957
- Then Mr. Hagen is in New York, too.
- Here, in this hotel?

1558
01:42:02,957 --> 01:42:05,957
That's right. He left his room.
I got to protect him.

1559
01:42:12,357 --> 01:42:14,757
- Where have you been, Mr. Hagen?
- All right, upstairs.

1560
01:42:14,957 --> 01:42:17,358
- You've been in Detroit, Mr. Hagen?
- Yeah, yeah.

1561
01:42:19,358 --> 01:42:21,358
There is an old saying which says:

1562
01:42:21,358 --> 01:42:25,357
"lt is not who you know that matters
in this world, but what you know."

1563
01:42:26,157 --> 01:42:30,357
For instance, I know that Mike Hagen
is hiding out in the Gage Hotel.

1564
01:42:30,957 --> 01:42:34,757
This is a nice slice of information,
which dropped in the right company...

1565
01:42:34,958 --> 01:42:37,158
...could net me a nice piece of change.

1566
01:42:39,357 --> 01:42:42,957
Next day, I start hanging around
with Marty Daylor's boys.

1567
01:42:44,358 --> 01:42:48,157
And I learned something that is hot.
Real hot.

1568
01:42:48,957 --> 01:42:52,558
And worth even more to Mike Hagen
than I could get from Marty Daylor.

1569
01:42:57,758 --> 01:43:00,357
Hi, Max. Mr. Higginsbury in?

1570
01:43:01,357 --> 01:43:03,958
- Who?
- Mr. Hagen. Where is he?

1571
01:43:04,158 --> 01:43:05,557
Shut that door, Maxie.

1572
01:43:05,957 --> 01:43:07,557
Mike, boy.

1573
01:43:07,957 --> 01:43:10,557
- How did you know where I was?
- Relax, Mike, boy.

1574
01:43:10,757 --> 01:43:13,757
I met Maxie in the lobby last night.
Then I see you come in.

1575
01:43:13,957 --> 01:43:15,157
What do you want?

1576
01:43:15,157 --> 01:43:18,357
I got a nice slice of information for you,
very warm...

1577
01:43:18,558 --> 01:43:21,557
...that I could perhaps let you have
for a Willie McKinley.

1578
01:43:21,958 --> 01:43:24,357
If that's what I think it is, the answer is no.

1579
01:43:24,357 --> 01:43:28,357
Okay. It's too bad I can't get
to Mrs. Hagen on time.

1580
01:43:28,757 --> 01:43:33,557
Considering how warm this slice really is,
I think it's a very fair fee, Mike.

1581
01:43:33,557 --> 01:43:35,557
What's Mrs. Hagen got to do with this?

1582
01:43:35,757 --> 01:43:40,558
William McKinley.
A U.S. old president, cooled around 1900.

1583
01:43:41,157 --> 01:43:42,357
A half a grand.

1584
01:43:42,357 --> 01:43:45,758
I don't have it on me. I'm not poor enough
to have that much on me.

1585
01:43:45,758 --> 01:43:48,758
All right. I'll show you
Charlie's heart is in the right place.

1586
01:43:48,758 --> 01:43:53,158
From you, I would take paper.
For a leave of, say, about 30 days.

1587
01:43:53,158 --> 01:43:56,357
- Is hotel stationery legal?
- Without a doubt.

1588
01:43:58,358 --> 01:44:03,757
I, the undersigned,
promise to pay to Charles Arneg....

1589
01:44:04,357 --> 01:44:06,558
- Make it Charles, will you, Mike?
- Yeah.

1590
01:44:06,558 --> 01:44:11,758
$500, 30 days from the above date.

1591
01:44:17,158 --> 01:44:18,958
What about Mrs. Hagen?

1592
01:44:18,958 --> 01:44:23,957
Mart Daylor's boys are putting the snatch
on Mrs. Hagen tonight. In Boston.

1593
01:44:23,957 --> 01:44:24,957
How do you know?

1594
01:44:25,157 --> 01:44:27,757
I invest in a few beers
with the right people.

1595
01:44:27,757 --> 01:44:32,157
They can't find you, so naturally they got
to grab the next best thing, your wife.

1596
01:44:32,357 --> 01:44:33,758
Right after the show.

1597
01:44:33,957 --> 01:44:37,357
None of that "hold them for ransom" jazz
or that old-fashioned stuff.

1598
01:44:37,758 --> 01:44:40,958
They'll probably tuck her away
for a few days in a little hideout...

1599
01:44:40,958 --> 01:44:42,158
...and make a few scars.

1600
01:44:43,958 --> 01:44:44,957
Hello?

1601
01:44:45,158 --> 01:44:46,557
- Hello?
- Michael.

1602
01:44:47,158 --> 01:44:50,557
If you're calling the cops,
I think this is a very bad move.

1603
01:44:50,757 --> 01:44:53,957
Now suppose, for argument's sake,
the snatch is on?

1604
01:44:54,157 --> 01:44:56,757
Now, the boys have got to dump
your wife someplace.

1605
01:44:56,757 --> 01:44:59,957
And when they dump her,
she's liable to be very cold.

1606
01:45:01,157 --> 01:45:02,557
Hello?

1607
01:45:02,958 --> 01:45:05,958
Listen, get me the Palace Theater
in Boston. Backstage.

1608
01:45:05,958 --> 01:45:07,158
I'll talk to anybody.

1609
01:45:07,357 --> 01:45:09,757
That's the whole slice.
I'll see you around, Mike.

1610
01:45:09,757 --> 01:45:12,158
Wait. Where do you think you're going?

1611
01:45:12,158 --> 01:45:14,557
To the drug store, to invest in a malted.

1612
01:45:14,557 --> 01:45:17,757
With Mart Daylor maybe,
so you can earn another McKinley?

1613
01:45:17,757 --> 01:45:21,957
Mike, a guy's got to make his own way
in this world, but a thing like that, I just...

1614
01:45:22,157 --> 01:45:23,558
Maxie, cross-eyed.

1615
01:45:25,357 --> 01:45:29,157
Now, Max, boy. You remember me?
Charlie? Charlie Arneg?

1616
01:45:32,557 --> 01:45:35,757
I want to speak to Mrs. Michael Hagen.
Marilla Brown. Right away.

1617
01:45:35,957 --> 01:45:39,158
Impossible. I can't get her to the phone.
The curtain just went up.

1618
01:45:39,358 --> 01:45:43,157
This is her husband. I've got to talk to her.
It's a matter of life and death.

1619
01:45:43,358 --> 01:45:46,957
- Don't you understand? The curtain has...
- You hear me? Life and death.

1620
01:45:46,957 --> 01:45:47,957
All right!

1621
01:45:48,157 --> 01:45:49,758
Hurry up, girls. Come on.

1622
01:45:53,157 --> 01:45:55,958
Come on, girls. Let's get a move on now.
Here we go.

1623
01:46:01,957 --> 01:46:04,358
A matter of life and death.

1624
01:46:04,957 --> 01:46:07,757
There was a Hagenism if I ever heard one.

1625
01:46:11,957 --> 01:46:12,957
No dice.

1626
01:46:13,357 --> 01:46:14,557
Listen, you!

1627
01:46:22,557 --> 01:46:24,757
- Come on, Maxie.
- Where? What?

1628
01:46:24,757 --> 01:46:26,957
- We're going to Boston.
- Again?

1629
01:46:27,957 --> 01:46:29,158
Move!

1630
01:46:41,157 --> 01:46:43,157
- Come here with me.
- You wait here.

1631
01:46:43,157 --> 01:46:45,557
Something's the matter
with Lori's next change.

1632
01:46:45,557 --> 01:46:48,958
- They can't fix it. Will you take a look?
- When I agreed to come...

1633
01:46:48,958 --> 01:46:51,757
Marilla, don't be like that.
She can't go on the stage.

1634
01:46:51,757 --> 01:46:54,957
You can't do that. Please, Marilla!

1635
01:47:03,157 --> 01:47:05,157
It looks terrible.

1636
01:47:05,157 --> 01:47:08,157
They cleaned this dress and tacked it back.
I don't know how.

1637
01:47:08,157 --> 01:47:11,557
- Looks all right to me. What's the matter?
- First, I can't breathe.

1638
01:47:11,757 --> 01:47:16,158
- What's wrong with that?
- But she has to be cut all over.

1639
01:47:20,157 --> 01:47:21,157
Fine.

1640
01:47:22,757 --> 01:47:24,157
Where shall we start?

1641
01:47:24,957 --> 01:47:26,558
Wherever you think?

1642
01:47:31,958 --> 01:47:35,157
You can go now, Evelyn,
Miss Brown will take care of me.

1643
01:47:43,158 --> 01:47:47,358
- Shall we talk?
- Let's. What about?

1644
01:47:48,358 --> 01:47:51,357
Let's talk about Michael Hagen.

1645
01:47:51,757 --> 01:47:54,157
Interesting subject. You first.

1646
01:47:56,357 --> 01:47:59,757
Of course I knew Mike.
I knew him very well.

1647
01:48:00,958 --> 01:48:03,158
But I lost him when you came along.

1648
01:48:03,357 --> 01:48:07,158
He's quite a man, Michael Hagen.
No saint, of course...

1649
01:48:07,358 --> 01:48:10,557
...but you must have suspected that
before you married him.

1650
01:48:10,957 --> 01:48:13,358
Maybe, even,
that was why you married him.

1651
01:48:15,957 --> 01:48:19,957
I don't think you really minded that he'd
once been in love with another woman.

1652
01:48:19,957 --> 01:48:22,958
- You just couldn't take meeting her.
- Small-minded.

1653
01:48:23,557 --> 01:48:25,557
It could be your early upbringing.

1654
01:48:25,557 --> 01:48:28,557
You realize, of course,
I have a weapon in my hand.

1655
01:48:28,557 --> 01:48:32,557
Would it be small-minded to ask you what
my husband was doing in your apartment...

1656
01:48:32,557 --> 01:48:34,158
...at night, pie-eyed?

1657
01:48:35,757 --> 01:48:38,358
Just one right here
and I think we'll have it.

1658
01:48:40,357 --> 01:48:42,357
Mike never left town, you know.

1659
01:48:42,758 --> 01:48:46,157
- He was in New York all the time.
- So he told me.

1660
01:48:47,557 --> 01:48:50,157
- Did he tell you why?
- He tried to.

1661
01:48:50,557 --> 01:48:53,557
You should have listened.
Not that you'd care for it.

1662
01:48:53,557 --> 01:48:57,557
I'm sure you could never stand anything
that approached physical violence.

1663
01:48:57,757 --> 01:49:01,757
Up to the moment, no, but I'm beginning
to find the prospect very alluring.

1664
01:49:02,358 --> 01:49:06,357
I still haven't heard what my husband
was doing shoeless in your apartment.

1665
01:49:09,157 --> 01:49:11,557
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

1666
01:49:12,557 --> 01:49:15,557
He came there that night
to make up a lie about us.

1667
01:49:17,958 --> 01:49:20,557
Give him a chance
and he'll tell it to you sometime.

1668
01:49:20,757 --> 01:49:24,158
- A real dilly. You'll love it.
- Give me a hint.

1669
01:49:24,158 --> 01:49:26,358
I don't want to spoil it for you.

1670
01:49:27,957 --> 01:49:31,957
But if I were you, I'd believe it.

1671
01:49:33,357 --> 01:49:37,357
After all, he's only lying about something
that happened before he met you.

1672
01:49:37,557 --> 01:49:39,557
He has nothing to lie about since.

1673
01:49:40,958 --> 01:49:42,357
Take my word for it.

1674
01:49:44,158 --> 01:49:48,957
That's what I'd like to find sometime.
The kind of man who'd love me so much...

1675
01:49:49,158 --> 01:49:53,157
...that he'd do anything, no matter
how silly, just so I'd never be hurt.

1676
01:49:53,757 --> 01:49:55,757
That's what I've been looking for.

1677
01:49:56,558 --> 01:49:58,357
And I darn near had it.

1678
01:50:03,958 --> 01:50:06,157
It's all right now, Miss Shannon.

1679
01:50:08,158 --> 01:50:09,757
Thank you, Mrs. Hagen.

1680
01:50:38,358 --> 01:50:41,757
- Where are you?
- In New York, with Mike.

1681
01:50:44,357 --> 01:50:45,957
Why don't you leave?

1682
01:50:46,757 --> 01:50:50,357
Everything is all right.
You're just in the way here now.

1683
01:50:53,357 --> 01:50:54,557
Thank you, Zach.

1684
01:50:57,557 --> 01:50:58,757
Mrs. Hagen.

1685
01:51:03,757 --> 01:51:07,157
I'm Johnny O.
We were introduced by your husband.

1686
01:51:07,358 --> 01:51:11,957
- Of course. How are you, Mr. O?
- Mrs. Hagen, your husband is in trouble.

1687
01:51:11,957 --> 01:51:15,957
- Trouble? What kind of trouble?
- Bad. A matter of life and death.

1688
01:51:16,357 --> 01:51:18,958
- No.
- He wants to see you, Mrs. Hagen.

1689
01:51:18,958 --> 01:51:22,158
He's been hiding out,
printing those articles about Mr. Daylor...

1690
01:51:22,158 --> 01:51:24,957
...and some very rough people
have put the finger on him.

1691
01:51:24,957 --> 01:51:28,557
I could take you to him right away.
There's a plane in about 20 minutes.

1692
01:51:28,557 --> 01:51:30,557
Please!

1693
01:51:34,957 --> 01:51:36,558
Good night, Miss Brown.

1694
01:51:42,758 --> 01:51:45,157
What? No, let me go.

1695
01:51:57,558 --> 01:51:59,558
The punchy. Get that punchy.

1696
01:52:14,957 --> 01:52:16,557
Maxie, cross-eyed!

1697
01:52:18,158 --> 01:52:19,757
Maxie, cross-eyed!

1698
01:52:30,157 --> 01:52:31,758
Somebody, help!

1699
01:52:37,958 --> 01:52:40,158
Cross-eyed. Cross-eyed.

1700
01:52:40,757 --> 01:52:42,557
I realized what was happening.

1701
01:52:42,757 --> 01:52:45,757
Maxie couldn't tell
the good guys from the bad.

1702
01:52:46,157 --> 01:52:47,757
Cross-eyed!

1703
01:52:57,557 --> 01:52:59,557
Fellows, we can't have this sort of thing.

1704
01:52:59,757 --> 01:53:03,958
There's a show going on in here.
Don't you realize this is an opening night?

1705
01:53:03,958 --> 01:53:06,757
- Would you mind telling me what this...
- No, Maxie! No!

1706
01:53:06,757 --> 01:53:07,957
Cross-eyed.

1707
01:53:18,157 --> 01:53:20,157
Get that big punchy.

1708
01:53:29,158 --> 01:53:32,358
Stop it, you. Both of you. Stop.

1709
01:53:49,557 --> 01:53:52,958
Marilla, will you get in here?
There's trouble with the costumes.

1710
01:54:01,358 --> 01:54:02,358
Foul.

1711
01:54:30,957 --> 01:54:32,357
There he is.

1712
01:55:07,958 --> 01:55:10,557
- Randy, boy.
- Hi, Mike.

1713
01:55:46,357 --> 01:55:47,758
Are you all right, dear?

1714
01:55:47,957 --> 01:55:49,357
- Are you all right?
- Sure.

1715
01:55:49,557 --> 01:55:51,758
- Did they hurt you?
- I'm all okay.

1716
01:55:51,758 --> 01:55:53,958
- Poor darling.
- Are you all right, sweetheart?

1717
01:55:53,958 --> 01:55:55,958
- Are you sure you're fine?
- Yes. Look.

1718
01:55:56,157 --> 01:55:57,557
Right now, before anything...

1719
01:55:57,757 --> 01:56:00,158
...I want to straighten you out
on the Shannon thing.

1720
01:56:00,158 --> 01:56:02,557
Mike, you don't have to.
Please, believe me.

1721
01:56:02,557 --> 01:56:04,358
No, I want to. Now, listen.

1722
01:56:04,957 --> 01:56:07,358
Lori Shannon comes from Wisconsin.

1723
01:56:07,558 --> 01:56:09,957
A friend of mine,
on the Green Bay Packers...

1724
01:56:09,957 --> 01:56:11,757
...sent me a picture of her.

1725
01:56:11,957 --> 01:56:14,157
Asked me to use my influence
to get her a job.

1726
01:56:14,357 --> 01:56:18,157
Lori was right. lt was a real dilly.

1727
01:56:18,157 --> 01:56:21,357
But I forgot to get rid of the picture.

1728
01:56:21,757 --> 01:56:24,357
And that's how you found it.

1729
01:56:25,757 --> 01:56:26,357
See?

1730
01:56:26,557 --> 01:56:30,557
Mike, darling.
Why didn't you tell me this before?

1731
01:56:35,957 --> 01:56:36,957
For the record.

1732
01:56:37,157 --> 01:56:40,758
Mart Daylor was convicted
and sentenced to three to five years.

1733
01:56:42,357 --> 01:56:45,958
He was released after eight months,
for good behavior.

1734
01:56:46,958 --> 01:56:51,357
But his reputation as a crook was ruined,
and he faded into obscurity.

1735
01:56:51,757 --> 01:56:54,158
Mike and I are still together of course.

1736
01:56:54,158 --> 01:56:56,757
We never argue anymore,
and when we do...

1737
01:56:56,957 --> 01:57:01,558
...it never lasts more than a week or two.
We are really very happily married.

1738
01:57:02,357 --> 01:57:05,758
We don't often mention Lori Shannon
in our household...

1739
01:57:06,357 --> 01:57:08,758
...though I understand
she's quite happy, too.

1740
01:57:10,157 --> 01:57:13,158
Well, why shouldn't I be?

1741
01:57:13,757 --> 01:57:17,757
Zachary and I
have been engaged for sometime.

1742
01:57:17,757 --> 01:57:20,557
That's enough, boy. Now, stop.

1743
01:57:22,757 --> 01:57:25,558
Well, I think that about sums up the story.

1744
01:57:26,757 --> 01:57:29,758
Unless, of course,
Maxie has something to add.

1745
01:57:32,157 --> 01:57:34,357
I'm making a comeback, you know?
