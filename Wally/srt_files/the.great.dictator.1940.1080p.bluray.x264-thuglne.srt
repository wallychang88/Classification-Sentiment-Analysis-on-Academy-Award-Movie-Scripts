00:02:54,088 --> 00:02:57,006
<i>In the last year of the World War,
the Tomainian nation began to weaken.</i>

2
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:59,008
<i>Behind her lines
revolution had broken out.</i>

3
00:02:59,093 --> 00:03:01,010
<i>Her diplomats were frantically
suing for peace...</i>

4
00:03:01,095 --> 00:03:03,263
<i>while at the front
Tomainia's army fought on...</i>

5
00:03:03,347 --> 00:03:05,265
<i>confident its war machine
was invincible...</i>

6
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:08,017
<i>confident its war machine
would smash the enemy's lines.</i>

7
00:03:08,102 --> 00:03:11,020
<i>Big Bertha, a cannon that could
hurl a projectile a hundred miles...</i>

8
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:13,690
<i>was this day to make its first
appearance on the Western Front...</i>

9
00:03:13,774 --> 00:03:16,442
<i>was this day to strike terror
into the hearts of the enemy.</i>

10
00:03:16,527 --> 00:03:20,863
<i>Seventy-five miles away was her target,
the cathedral of Notre Dame.</i>

11
00:03:23,617 --> 00:03:26,578
Range: 95,452!

12
00:03:26,662 --> 00:03:29,122
- Range: 95,452!
- Yes, sir!

13
00:03:29,206 --> 00:03:31,749
- Stand clear!
- Fire!

14
00:03:48,516 --> 00:03:50,767
Hey!
Stand by your trigger.

15
00:03:50,852 --> 00:03:52,394
Yes, sir.

16
00:03:52,478 --> 00:03:56,148
Range correction: 95,455!

17
00:03:56,232 --> 00:03:58,817
- Range: 95,455!
- Yes, sir!

18
00:03:59,694 --> 00:04:01,153
Breach secured!

19
00:04:01,237 --> 00:04:02,404
Stand clear!

20
00:04:02,488 --> 00:04:04,156
Ready! Fire!

21
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:22,799
Defective shell.
We'll examine it. Come on.

22
00:04:22,884 --> 00:04:28,055
Come on.

23
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,187
- We'd better check the fuse.
- Yes, check the fuse.

24
00:04:35,271 --> 00:04:37,272
Yes, sir. The fuse.

25
00:05:10,807 --> 00:05:13,308
Look out! Come on! Run!

26
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:30,032
- What's that?
- An air raid!

27
00:05:30,117 --> 00:05:32,868
- They're after Big Bertha!
- Right! To the antiaircraft gun!

28
00:05:32,953 --> 00:05:34,620
- To the gun!
- Quick!

29
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,815
Hey! Have you gone crazy?

30
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:04,900
Come down out of there!

31
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:16,454
Get up there, will you!

32
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:18,956
What do you think you're doing?
Have you gone crazy?

33
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,083
- Sorry, sir -
- Sir! Report from Captain Snout!

34
00:06:21,168 --> 00:06:23,210
The enemy have broken through!
Every man to the front!

35
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:26,088
Muster the gun crew, quick!
You, report to Sergeant Bloom.

36
00:06:26,173 --> 00:06:27,673
- Come on!
- Yes, sir!

37
00:06:27,758 --> 00:06:30,301
Get your hand grenades there, soldiers.

38
00:06:30,385 --> 00:06:32,094
Come on there.
Get your hand grenades.

39
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:34,597
Hey, soldier! Where's your hand grenade?
Hey, come here!

40
00:06:34,681 --> 00:06:36,599
- Where's your hand grenade?
- Haven't got any, sir.

41
00:06:36,683 --> 00:06:38,601
Give him a hand grenade.
Go on.

42
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:45,232
Keep moving. Come along.
Move forward.

43
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:47,318
Hurry it up.
Come along. Hurry up.

44
00:06:47,402 --> 00:06:49,820
Pardon me, sir, but to work this -
How do you -

45
00:06:49,905 --> 00:06:51,906
Pull the pin, count 10 and throw it.

46
00:07:03,877 --> 00:07:06,420
Let 'em have it!

47
00:07:17,723 --> 00:07:19,349
Hey, come on!

48
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:29,400
Hey, this is no time to scratch.

49
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:36,115
Here, pull yourself together.

50
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,700
Take this.

51
00:07:38,744 --> 00:07:40,036
Forward!

52
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:43,498
Hey, you men! Fall in here!

53
00:07:43,582 --> 00:07:46,125
Hey, you, come on!
Hurry it up there!

54
00:07:50,756 --> 00:07:52,465
Order! Arms!

55
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:54,843
Ow!

56
00:07:54,927 --> 00:07:56,511
Prepare to attack!

57
00:07:56,595 --> 00:07:58,054
Forward!

58
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,944
Captain!

59
00:08:15,698 --> 00:08:17,282
Yoo-hoo!

60
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:23,621
<i>Capitán!</i>

61
00:08:28,252 --> 00:08:29,752
Yoo-hoo!

62
00:08:39,638 --> 00:08:41,890
- There you are.
- Huh?

63
00:08:41,974 --> 00:08:43,474
Hmm?

64
00:08:50,648 --> 00:08:52,232
Oh, excuse me!

65
00:08:52,317 --> 00:08:55,235
The enemy!
Come on, fellas! Let's get him!

66
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:04,661
Good afternoon, sir. May I come in?

67
00:09:04,746 --> 00:09:06,830
- Who is it?
- Friend.

68
00:09:06,915 --> 00:09:08,582
Come in.

69
00:09:11,044 --> 00:09:12,419
- Sir.
- What division?

70
00:09:12,503 --> 00:09:13,921
21 st Artillery, sir.

71
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:15,923
Take this. Hold 'em off.
And keep firing.

72
00:09:16,007 --> 00:09:18,008
- I'll be back in a moment.
- Yes, sir.

73
00:09:35,276 --> 00:09:37,694
Help! Comrade, help!

74
00:09:43,868 --> 00:09:45,786
- What is it?
- I'm exhausted.

75
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,913
Quick! Help me to my plane!

76
00:09:47,997 --> 00:09:49,998
Yes, sir.

77
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:52,668
- Thank you, my lad.
- Steady.

78
00:09:52,752 --> 00:09:55,003
I'll see you get
the Tomainian Cross for this.

79
00:09:55,088 --> 00:09:57,923
That's all right, sir.
I'm only too willing to oblige.

80
00:10:06,057 --> 00:10:08,350
Oh, you saved my life.

81
00:10:08,434 --> 00:10:10,519
- Thank you.
- I'll strap you in.

82
00:10:10,603 --> 00:10:12,771
I'm weak.
I can't make it alone.

83
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:14,815
- You'll have to stay with me.
- All right, sir.

84
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:17,192
- Can you fly a plane?
- I can try.

85
00:10:19,237 --> 00:10:22,990
Quick! Lift my hand to the stick.
I haven't the strength.

86
00:10:23,074 --> 00:10:26,159
- Take charge of that gun, Sergeant!
- Yes, sir!

87
00:10:26,244 --> 00:10:29,787
The enemy! They're coming!
Quick! Lift my hand to the throttle!

88
00:10:29,871 --> 00:10:32,915
We'll fool 'em!

89
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,355
- Here. Hold on to these dispatches.
- Yes, sir.

90
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,067
If we can deliver them to General
Schmelloffel, Tomainia may yet win the day!

91
00:11:02,446 --> 00:11:05,197
- I think I'm going to faint.
- Oh, don't say that.

92
00:11:05,282 --> 00:11:07,324
I'm sorry, old man.

93
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:09,201
- Huh?
- I'm sorry.

94
00:11:09,286 --> 00:11:11,287
Oh, wait - Please! Hey!

95
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,205
Hey, mister!

96
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,917
- Hey!
- Where am I?

97
00:11:17,002 --> 00:11:19,211
- Don't you know me?
- Oh, yes. Of course.

98
00:11:19,296 --> 00:11:20,880
- Of course.
- Yes.

99
00:11:20,964 --> 00:11:23,049
Yes, I - I feel better now.

100
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:25,593
- Ah.
- The blood's returning to my head.

101
00:11:25,677 --> 00:11:27,470
What's below?

102
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,555
- Looks like the sun.
- The sun?

103
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:32,349
- Seems to be shining upwards.
- Strange.

104
00:11:32,434 --> 00:11:35,061
- How's the gas?
- Terrible. It kept me awake all night.

105
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:37,229
No, no, no!
The gasoline in the tank!

106
00:11:37,314 --> 00:11:39,398
Oh. Almost empty.

107
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:42,401
We must be nearly there.
What time is it?

108
00:11:42,486 --> 00:11:43,861
Time?

109
00:11:43,945 --> 00:11:47,281
About, approximately, one minute to 12:00.

110
00:11:52,496 --> 00:11:53,996
Strange.

111
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,916
Look at that.

112
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,709
Huh! Huh.

113
00:12:00,462 --> 00:12:03,172
Seem to be defying
the laws of gravity.

114
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:08,177
Hmm.

115
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:09,762
Water!

116
00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:11,262
- Huh?
- Quick! I'm going to faint!

117
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:13,640
Uh, wait a while. Wait a wh -

118
00:12:13,724 --> 00:12:16,810
You'll get - We'll get into trouble
if you faint any more now.

119
00:12:16,894 --> 00:12:18,394
- Ohh. Ohh.
- Now be careful.

120
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:19,771
- Here now. Just hold it.
- Quick.

121
00:12:19,855 --> 00:12:22,941
Hold it. Hold it. I think I can
- We'll just see -

122
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:25,401
Faint. Water.

123
00:12:27,488 --> 00:12:29,989
- What on -
- Oh, water.

124
00:12:30,074 --> 00:12:32,450
- Here, take it!
- Oh! Quick!

125
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:34,619
- There's something wrong.
- Oh! Ohh!

126
00:12:34,703 --> 00:12:36,496
Oh, I can't reach it.

127
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,207
Oh, water! Faint!

128
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,292
Ah! Oh, it's all gone!

129
00:12:41,377 --> 00:12:43,086
What's the matter?

130
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,338
- This belt is too tight.
- Well, loosen it.

131
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:46,840
I'm trying to.

132
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:50,468
We're upside down.

133
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:52,470
- I know it.
- Give me that stick!

134
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:53,805
Impossible.

135
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:55,765
Oh. There it goes.

136
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,559
We're out of gas.

137
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:00,645
Well, I suppose this is the end.

138
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:02,564
- Cigarette?
- Not now.

139
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,649
Then I shan't need this anymore.

140
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:06,317
What month is it?

141
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:07,735
April.

142
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,071
Spring in Tomainia.

143
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:13,658
Hilda will be in the garden now
tending the daffodils.

144
00:13:13,742 --> 00:13:16,327
How she loves daffodils.

145
00:13:16,412 --> 00:13:19,539
She would never cut them
for fear of hurting them.

146
00:13:19,623 --> 00:13:23,251
It was like taking a life
to cut a daffodil.

147
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,296
Sweet, gentle Hilda.

148
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,053
A beautiful soul.

149
00:13:34,138 --> 00:13:36,222
And she loved animals.

150
00:13:36,307 --> 00:13:38,433
And little children too.

151
00:13:43,814 --> 00:13:45,982
We've landed! Dispatches!

152
00:13:46,066 --> 00:13:48,026
Comrade, where are you?

153
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,444
Comrade!

154
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:57,492
Comrade, the dispatches!
Tell me, where are they?

155
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:02,789
- Are you hurt?
- Quick! Take me to General Schmelloffel!

156
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:04,166
- What's that?
- Hurry, man!

157
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,127
If I don't deliver these dispatches
at once, we're defeated!

158
00:14:07,212 --> 00:14:08,629
- Well, the war's over.
- What?

159
00:14:08,713 --> 00:14:10,505
- We lost.
- Lost?

160
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:07,020
<i>Hynkel Party Takes Power!</i>

161
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:10,023
<i>Meanwhile, the Jewish soldier,
ex-barber, veteran of the World War...</i>

162
00:15:10,108 --> 00:15:10,986
<i>suffered a loss of memory</i>

163
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:13,467
<i>and remained an inmate of the
soldier's hospital for many years.</i>

164
00:15:13,528 --> 00:15:16,321
<i>He was ignorant of the profound change
that had come over Tomainia.</i>

165
00:15:16,406 --> 00:15:19,074
<i>Hynkel the dictator ruled the nation
with an iron fist.</i>

166
00:15:19,158 --> 00:15:21,743
<i>Under the new emblem of the Double Cross
liberty was banished...</i>

167
00:15:21,828 --> 00:15:23,287
<i>free speech was suppressed...</i>

168
00:15:23,371 --> 00:15:25,497
<i>and only the voice of Hynkel was heard.</i>

169
00:15:30,336 --> 00:15:32,045
<i>...und ze sauerkraut!</i>

170
00:15:48,437 --> 00:15:50,062
Baloney.

171
00:15:50,147 --> 00:15:53,149
Baloney -

172
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,751
<i>Adenoid Hynkel has just said...</i>

173
00:16:11,835 --> 00:16:14,837
<i>yesterday Tomainia was down,
but today she has risen.</i>

174
00:16:32,147 --> 00:16:34,357

<i>Democracy is fragrant.</i>

<i>Liberty shtunk!</i>

177
00:16:38,236 --> 00:16:40,029
<i>Liberty is odious.</i>

<i>Free sprechen shtunk!</i>

179
00:16:42,616 --> 00:16:45,034
<i>Freedom of speech is objectionable.</i>

180
00:16:48,413 --> 00:16:50,539
<i>Tomainia has the greatest
army in the world.</i>

181
00:16:52,626 --> 00:16:54,543
<i>The greatest navy in the world.</i>

182
00:16:58,882 --> 00:17:01,300
<i>But to remain great we must sacrifice.</i>

183
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,597
<i>We must tighten our belts.</i>

184
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:07,973
Hail Hynkel!

185
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:21,152

<i>Ohh, der Juden.</i>

215
00:19:29,822 --> 00:19:32,282
<i>His Excellency

<i>His Excellency is about

Ach! Ohh! Your Excellency!

00:21:32,361 --> 00:21:34,487

Inside, da booben.

245
00:22:05,477 --> 00:22:07,978
You ride in the other car.

246
00:22:12,442 --> 00:22:14,110
Thank you, children.

247
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:17,947
<i>His Excellency seems well pleased...</i>

248
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:22,534
<i>as he's greeted by a committee
of Tomainian children and their mothers.</i>

249
00:22:22,618 --> 00:22:25,829
<i>Now he pauses
before a woman with a child.</i>

250
00:22:28,207 --> 00:22:30,041
Camera.

251
00:22:30,126 --> 00:22:32,043
<i>Even the baby is thrilled...</i>

252
00:22:32,128 --> 00:22:34,754
<i>and seems all smiles
at His Excellency's attention.</i>

253
00:22:57,361 --> 00:22:59,404
Hail Hynkel!

254
00:22:59,488 --> 00:23:01,823
<i>His Excellency leaves
the scene of his triumph...</i>

255
00:23:01,907 --> 00:23:04,826
<i>and will return to the palace along
Hynkelstrasse, the avenue of culture...</i>

256
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,162
<i>where he will pass Tomainia's
modern masterpieces...</i>

257
00:23:07,246 --> 00:23:09,748
The Venus of Today
and The Thinker of Tomorrow.

258
00:23:18,716 --> 00:23:20,091
- How was it?
- The speech?

259
00:23:20,176 --> 00:23:22,343
- Yes.
- Oh, very good.

260
00:23:22,428 --> 00:23:25,680
Thought your reference to the Jews
might have been a little more violent.

261
00:23:25,765 --> 00:23:28,516
- What?
- You've got to rouse the people's anger.

262
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:29,727
At this time,

263
00:23:29,752 --> 00:23:33,128
violence against the Jews might take
the public's mind off its stomach.

264
00:23:33,189 --> 00:23:35,106
Hmm. Perhaps you're right.

265
00:23:35,191 --> 00:23:37,776
Things have been quiet
in the ghetto lately.

266
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:03,467
Good morning, Mr. Jaeckel.

267
00:24:03,551 --> 00:24:05,219
What's good about it?

268
00:24:05,303 --> 00:24:07,304
Well, conditions could be worse.

269
00:24:07,388 --> 00:24:10,808
If you think they could be worse,
you have a great imagination.

270
00:24:10,892 --> 00:24:13,101
Aha. You heard Hynkel's speech.

271
00:24:13,186 --> 00:24:16,438
I heard nothing.
I've got my own troubles.

272
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:19,441
Well, you're better off
than a lot of other people.

273
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:22,820
- What have you heard from the barber?
- Still in the hospital.

274
00:24:22,904 --> 00:24:25,572
Aye. Ever since the war
he's been there.

275
00:24:25,657 --> 00:24:26,907
Yep.

276
00:24:26,991 --> 00:24:29,618
Why don't you try and rent
his barbershop for him?

277
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:31,662
He won't let me.

278
00:24:31,746 --> 00:24:34,498
Every few weeks
he writes to say he's coming back.

279
00:24:34,582 --> 00:24:37,668
It seems a pity it should be idle
all these years.

280
00:24:37,752 --> 00:24:39,670
Well, why worry?

281
00:24:39,754 --> 00:24:42,840
With the taxes the government
will soon take it away from him.

282
00:24:42,924 --> 00:24:44,633
Aye, perhaps you're right.

283
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,844
It isn't such a good morning after all.

284
00:24:46,928 --> 00:24:48,929
Now you said it.

285
00:24:49,931 --> 00:24:52,683
- Hannah.
- Yes, Mr. Jaeckel?

286
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:55,686
On the mantelpiece
you'll find my tobacco pouch.

287
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:58,063
- Will you get it?
- All right, Mr. Jaeckel.

288
00:24:58,147 --> 00:25:01,191
Yeah, seems everyone
is full of troubles.

289
00:25:01,276 --> 00:25:03,026
Ah, everyone.

290
00:25:03,111 --> 00:25:05,028
Look at Hannah, poor girl.

291
00:25:05,113 --> 00:25:07,531
A hard worker.
Can't get a job.

292
00:25:07,615 --> 00:25:11,076
Father was killed in the war.
Mother died last year.

293
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,705
Can't earn enough to pay the rent
for her room. What can I do?

294
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:16,790
I can't throw her out.

295
00:25:25,174 --> 00:25:27,759
- You'll need some more tobacco.
- Where are you going?

296
00:25:27,844 --> 00:25:29,595
I'm delivering Mrs. Shoemaker's laundry.

297
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,014
Oh, you'd better take the key.

298
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:34,433
Mrs. Jaeckel and myself
are going out.

299
00:25:34,517 --> 00:25:36,435
I'm locking up all the doors...

300
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:39,521
in case the storm troopers will start
their monkey business again.

That's all right.
Just charge it to my account.

Nice, ripe tomatoes, boys!

00:26:28,904 --> 00:26:33,282
Why don't some of you do something?
I wish I was a man. I'd show ya.

314
00:26:33,367 --> 00:26:35,618

317
00:26:39,456 --> 00:26:41,874
- Aw, shut up!
- Is that why you got a truck?

318
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:43,544
To run away in case
somebody hits you back?

319
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:44,901
Shut up, or we'll
take you down.

320
00:26:44,962 --> 00:26:47,880
All right, come on and take me.
You'll get a lot of medals for it.

321
00:26:47,965 --> 00:26:50,800
That's all you can do is to pick on women
and rob defenseless people.

322
00:26:50,884 --> 00:26:54,303
Aw, don't rob the poor girl, boys.
Give her back her tomatoes.

323
00:26:54,388 --> 00:26:55,888
Here!

324
00:27:33,676 --> 00:27:37,345
Oh, I'll have to do it all over again.

325
00:27:39,598 --> 00:27:41,141
Pigs.

326
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:47,439
<i>- Send in patient 33.
- Yes, sir.</i>

327
00:27:47,523 --> 00:27:49,107
Here's an interesting case.

328
00:27:49,191 --> 00:27:51,276
Amnesia. Jewish soldier.

329
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,696
Been here since the war. Has an idea
he's been here only a few weeks.

330
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,990
Has he any idea
what's happened in the meantime?

331
00:27:57,074 --> 00:27:58,491
Not the least.

332
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:00,932
His one interest seems
to be in his barbershop,

333
00:28:00,957 --> 00:28:03,312
which he believes he left
only a few weeks ago.

334
00:28:03,372 --> 00:28:05,790
Poor devil. He'll have
many surprises waiting for him.

335
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:08,126
I'm afraid so.

336
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:10,211
<i>- Yes?
- Number 33 is gone.</i>

337
00:28:10,296 --> 00:28:12,213
Gone?
But he was to be examined.

338
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:15,216
<i>- I know, sir, but he disappeared.
- Disappeared?</i>

339
00:28:15,301 --> 00:28:18,553
Well, let him go.
It isn't a serious case.

340
00:28:18,637 --> 00:28:21,139
Besides, there's little more
we can do for him.

341
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,724
Hey, go on.
Beat it up there.

342
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:50,144
Come on! Get outta -
You! Go on!

343
00:30:15,003 --> 00:30:17,337
What do you think you're doing?

344
00:30:17,422 --> 00:30:20,174
- I really don't know.
- Well, you leave that alone.

345
00:30:21,426 --> 00:30:23,635
- Don't be silly.
- I'm not silly!

346
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,137
I appreciate that.

347
00:30:25,221 --> 00:30:27,598
When you talk to me,
hail Hynkel and salute.

348
00:30:27,682 --> 00:30:29,183
Who are you anyway?

349
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,103
I'll show you who I am.

350
00:30:33,188 --> 00:30:34,855
Come down to headquarters.

351
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:37,858
- Say, that's my shop!
- I don't care if it is or not.

352
00:30:37,942 --> 00:30:40,694
- You leave me alone!
- Oh! Gonna put up a fight, are ya?

353
00:30:40,778 --> 00:30:43,864
Come on down, pal.
I'll show you.

354
00:30:43,948 --> 00:30:46,365
Now let me tell you something -

355
00:30:49,536 --> 00:30:52,622
Are you a policeman?
Arrest that man for assault.

356
00:30:52,706 --> 00:30:54,624
- Come here, you!
- Leave me alone!

357
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:57,251
Attacking a storm trooper, huh?

358
00:30:57,336 --> 00:30:59,003
- Take him down!
- You'll hear from my lawyer!

359
00:30:59,087 --> 00:31:01,714
- Come on, you little -
- Why, you -

360
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:04,842
Turn him around!

361
00:31:05,886 --> 00:31:07,220
He bit my finger!

362
00:31:41,463 --> 00:31:42,713
<i>Pardon.</i>

363
00:31:58,647 --> 00:32:01,148
Oh, I'm sorry, mister.
I didn't mean to hit you.

364
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:03,192
You were wonderful.
I enjoyed that.

365
00:32:03,277 --> 00:32:04,956
But don't stand there.
You'd better beat it.

366
00:32:04,981 --> 00:32:06,136
No, I'll call a policeman.

367
00:32:06,196 --> 00:32:07,822
- No, no, don't do that.
- Why not?

368
00:32:07,906 --> 00:32:09,615
You crazy?

369
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,617
- Look out. There's more coming.
- More what?

370
00:32:11,702 --> 00:32:13,411
Wait a minute!

371
00:32:19,209 --> 00:32:21,043
Come in here!

372
00:32:23,547 --> 00:32:26,464
What's wrong with you?
There's no use being foolhardy.

373
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:28,216
- Who?
- Shh!

374
00:32:32,054 --> 00:32:33,930
Stop the car!

375
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:38,476
Hello! What's this?
Who hit you?

376
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:40,668
I don't know. I think
there were a gang of 'em.

377
00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:42,755
Here, you'd better go
along, get fixed up.

378
00:32:42,815 --> 00:32:44,441
We'll investigate later.

379
00:32:44,525 --> 00:32:46,776
- What time is it?
- Come on. Get in.

380
00:32:55,494 --> 00:32:56,828
I don't see what is -

381
00:33:07,006 --> 00:33:09,174
It's all right now.
They've gone.

382
00:33:09,258 --> 00:33:10,842
Thanks, mister.

383
00:33:10,926 --> 00:33:13,053
That did me a lot of good.

384
00:33:15,681 --> 00:33:18,516
You sure got nerve,
the way you fought back.

385
00:33:18,601 --> 00:33:21,311
That's what we should all do -
fight back.

386
00:33:21,395 --> 00:33:24,814
We can't fight alone,
but we can lick 'em together.

387
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,526
We didn't do so bad, did we?

388
00:33:28,611 --> 00:33:30,320
So long.

389
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,130
Oh, excuse me.

390
00:33:49,215 --> 00:33:52,217
You're the barber,
the one that was in the hospital.

391
00:33:52,301 --> 00:33:56,513
Mr. Jaeckel's often talked about you.
We didn't think you were ever coming back.

392
00:33:56,597 --> 00:33:58,390
Huh?

393
00:33:58,474 --> 00:34:00,892
But the storm troopers,
they'll be looking for ya.

394
00:34:00,976 --> 00:34:02,227
Storm troopers?

395
00:34:02,311 --> 00:34:05,522
You'd better hide.
Wait. I'll get the key to the cellar.

396
00:34:13,613 --> 00:34:15,823
- Is this the man?
- That's him.

397
00:34:16,616 --> 00:34:18,075
Hail Hynkel.

398
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,326
Who's he?

399
00:34:19,994 --> 00:34:23,080
Don't fool with me.
I said, hail Hynkel!

400
00:34:23,164 --> 00:34:25,332
- All right.
- Put out your hands.

401
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:28,669
Just a moment. We won't put 'em on here.
Bring him outside.

402
00:34:28,753 --> 00:34:31,171
Yes. Come on, you.
Come on!

403
00:34:32,757 --> 00:34:35,759
Before we take you down
you'll finish this. Here.

404
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,846
Go on. Paint that.

405
00:34:39,431 --> 00:34:41,181
Why, you -

406
00:34:52,944 --> 00:34:54,778
That's him!

407
00:35:17,844 --> 00:35:20,095
Wait a minute, boys! Wait a minute!

408
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,639
I've got an idea.
A bright idea.

409
00:35:22,724 --> 00:35:25,058
Sure! That's it!

410
00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:37,321
- And... give it the works!
- Heave ho!

411
00:35:39,115 --> 00:35:40,824
Wait a minute! Commander Schultz!

412
00:35:41,576 --> 00:35:42,951
Attention!

413
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:48,581
First in command.

414
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:51,918
- Yes, sir.
- What the -

415
00:35:52,002 --> 00:35:53,920
Second in command.

416
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:57,006
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, never mind.

417
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,341
- You!
- Yes, sir.

418
00:35:58,425 --> 00:36:00,968
What the devil goes on here? And who
told you to hang people from lampposts?

419
00:36:01,053 --> 00:36:01,710
No one, sir.

420
00:36:01,735 --> 00:36:03,703
My orders were to keep
these streets tidy.

421
00:36:03,764 --> 00:36:06,224
- What was the trouble?
- A Jew was attacking storm troopers, sir.

422
00:36:06,308 --> 00:36:08,351
- Where is he?
- There.

423
00:36:08,435 --> 00:36:10,102
Break ranks.

424
00:36:12,356 --> 00:36:15,483
Oh, so there you are.
Stand him up.

425
00:36:16,151 --> 00:36:17,818
Get up.

426
00:36:23,408 --> 00:36:24,575
You!

427
00:36:25,577 --> 00:36:27,703
- Don't you remember me?
- Huh?

428
00:36:27,788 --> 00:36:29,705
The war.
You saved my life.

429
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,083
- Me?
- Strange.

430
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:34,710
And I always thought of you as an Aryan.

431
00:36:34,795 --> 00:36:36,754
- I'm a vegetarian.
- Well, don't you remember?

432
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:39,799
The enemy tried to capture us,
but we got away in my plane.

433
00:36:39,883 --> 00:36:41,300
Plane?

434
00:36:41,385 --> 00:36:43,970
And then we crashed.

435
00:36:44,054 --> 00:36:45,721
Cra -

436
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:50,309
Oh, yes.

437
00:36:50,394 --> 00:36:52,061
Now I remember.

438
00:36:53,647 --> 00:36:56,190
- Well, how are you?
- What has my friend done?

439
00:36:56,275 --> 00:36:58,693
Our men were painting his windows,
Commander, and he resisted.

440
00:36:58,777 --> 00:37:00,778
Any brave man would resist.

441
00:37:00,862 --> 00:37:03,781
- I'm sorry this occurred.
- Oh. No harm.

442
00:37:03,865 --> 00:37:06,951
I'm sure that in the future
you will not be molested again.

443
00:37:07,035 --> 00:37:10,496
However, if you or your friends are ever
in any trouble, I hope you'll let me know.

444
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:14,709
Who did that?

445
00:37:14,793 --> 00:37:17,837
Oh. One of my friends.

446
00:37:18,964 --> 00:37:21,299
Oh. Of course.

447
00:37:27,514 --> 00:37:30,432
<i>Hynkel's palace was
the center of a gigantic enterprise...</i>

448
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:33,435
<i>an enterprise that would build
the world's greatest war machine.</i>

449
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:36,438
<i>Behind this undertaking was
the dynamic energy of Adenoid Hynkel...</i>

450
00:37:36,522 --> 00:37:38,440
<i>whose amazing genius
ran the entire nation...</i>

451
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:42,527
<i>whose ceaseless activity kept him
busily occupied every moment of the day.</i>

452
00:37:46,782 --> 00:37:48,283
Hup!

453
00:38:10,222 --> 00:38:11,848
<i>Marshal Herring is waiting,
Your Excellency.</i>

454
00:38:11,932 --> 00:38:13,224
Enough.

455
00:38:15,353 --> 00:38:16,603
Hail Hynkel.

456
00:38:16,687 --> 00:38:19,272
Your Excellency,
I believe we've got something now.

457
00:38:19,357 --> 00:38:22,651
A bulletproof uniform.
Material as light as silk.

458
00:38:22,735 --> 00:38:23,475
Where is it?

459
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,719
I've arranged for a
demonstration in the anteroom.

460
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,781
It will only take two minutes.

461
00:38:28,783 --> 00:38:30,450
I can spare one.

462
00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:37,332
- Professor Herr Kibitzen!
- Hail Hynkel!

463
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:39,959
Your Excellency,
actions speak louder than words.

464
00:38:40,044 --> 00:38:43,463
- A bulletproof uniform!
- And 100% perfect!

465
00:38:45,091 --> 00:38:46,549
Shoot.

466
00:38:52,098 --> 00:38:53,682
Far from perfect.

467
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:33,429
Zevell!

468
00:39:36,391 --> 00:39:38,809
- My secretary. Where is she?
- In the outer office, Your Excellency.

469
00:39:38,893 --> 00:39:40,227
- Call her.
- Yes, sir.

470
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:50,821
Hail Hynkel.

471
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,158
Take a letter.

472
00:40:08,715 --> 00:40:10,215
No! No, no!

473
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:21,351
<i>- Hello?
- This is Field Marshal Herring.</i>

474
00:40:21,436 --> 00:40:23,937
<i>I'm in the Tower Room.
We've got something marvelous.</i>

475
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:26,023
All right. I shall be up.

476
00:40:42,123 --> 00:40:43,791
- What is it?
- A parachute.

477
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:47,461
The most compact in the world.
Worn like an ordinary hat.

478
00:40:49,631 --> 00:40:51,631
It will open in 25 feet.

479
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:53,716
Demonstrate, Professor.

480
00:41:01,558 --> 00:41:02,975
Hail Hynkel!

481
00:41:13,487 --> 00:41:16,989
Herring, why do you
waste my time like this?

482
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,211
Send Garbitsch here.

483
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:43,015
<i>Herr Garbitsch is waiting, Your Excellency.</i>

484
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,767
Enough.

485
00:41:48,564 --> 00:41:49,981
Hail Hynkel.

486
00:41:50,065 --> 00:41:52,066
Garbitsch, what's the meaning of this,
these appropriations?

487
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,179
25 million for prison camps

488
00:41:53,204 --> 00:41:55,719
when we need every penny for the
manufacturing of munitions.

489
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:58,197
- We've had to make a few arrests.
- A few? How many?

490
00:41:58,282 --> 00:41:59,949
Nothing astronomical.
Five or ten thousand.

491
00:42:00,033 --> 00:42:01,534
- Oh.
- A day.

492
00:42:01,618 --> 00:42:03,703
- A day?
- Just a few dissenters, that's all.

493
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:06,914
- What do they dissent about?
- The working hours. The cut in wages.

494
00:42:06,999 --> 00:42:10,626
Chiefly, the synthetic food -
the quality of the sawdust in the bread.

495
00:42:10,711 --> 00:42:14,463
What more do they want? It's from
the finest lumber our mills can supply.

496
00:42:16,925 --> 00:42:19,552
Nevertheless,
the condition is getting dangerous.

497
00:42:19,636 --> 00:42:21,554
The people are overworked.
They need diversion.

498
00:42:21,638 --> 00:42:22,889
The people? Bah!

499
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:26,183
We might go a little further with the Jews.
Burn down some of their houses.

500
00:42:26,268 --> 00:42:29,061
Spectacular assault on the ghetto now
might prove diverting.

501
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:32,231
We must do something more dramatic.
Now is the time to invade Osterlich.

502
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:34,733
- How soon can we be ready?
- According to Herring, three months.

503
00:42:34,817 --> 00:42:38,278
I can't wait that long. Besides, Napaloni's
army might invade Osterlich before me.

504
00:42:38,362 --> 00:42:39,738
We must strike now.

505
00:42:39,822 --> 00:42:41,865
In that case,
we should require foreign capital.

506
00:42:41,949 --> 00:42:44,743
- Borrow it. Borrow it.
- The bankers have all refused.

507
00:42:44,827 --> 00:42:47,704
But wait. There's one man
who might make us a loan - Epstein.

508
00:42:47,788 --> 00:42:50,040
Epstein?
He's a Jew, isn't he?

509
00:42:50,124 --> 00:42:51,917
- Yes.
- Hmm.

510
00:42:52,001 --> 00:42:55,503
Well, let's be big about it.
We'll borrow the money from Epstein.

511
00:42:56,672 --> 00:43:00,091
It might be difficult
in view of our policy towards his people.

512
00:43:00,176 --> 00:43:02,510
Very well then.
We'll change our policy towards his people.

513
00:43:02,595 --> 00:43:06,264
Tell Commander Schultz that in future
all persecution of the Jews must cease...

514
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:09,726
at least until
we've negotiated this loan.

515
00:43:15,942 --> 00:43:17,525
I don't understand it.

516
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,986
The whole ghetto is so quiet now.

517
00:43:20,071 --> 00:43:23,114
You can't imagine what was going on
while you were away.

518
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:25,784
Oh, this Hynkel business.

519
00:43:25,868 --> 00:43:29,704
You weren't here.
You were in the hospital, unconscious.

520
00:43:29,789 --> 00:43:32,916
Believe me, you don't appreciate
what a good time you were having.

521
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:37,796
Well, if things get worse
we can go to Osterlich.

522
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,881
That's still a free country.

523
00:43:39,966 --> 00:43:42,801
Sooner or later we'll have to go.

524
00:43:42,885 --> 00:43:44,803
- Excuse me.
- Anyway...

525
00:43:44,887 --> 00:43:47,013
it's nice to see you back.

526
00:43:47,098 --> 00:43:49,015
It's like the old days again, eh?

527
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,643
- Yes.
- How's business?

528
00:43:51,727 --> 00:43:53,687
Very slow. Very slow.

529
00:43:55,147 --> 00:43:58,316
Trouble is, the men
are all in concentration camps.

530
00:43:58,401 --> 00:44:01,152
You should go in
for fixing up the women.

531
00:44:01,237 --> 00:44:03,238
Nice money
in the beauty parlor business.

532
00:44:03,322 --> 00:44:06,241
You know anything about it?

533
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:09,160
Huh?

534
00:44:09,245 --> 00:44:10,996
Me? No.

535
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,039
Well, you can learn.

536
00:44:13,124 --> 00:44:14,623
You can practice on Hannah.

537
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:16,375
Yes!

538
00:44:16,459 --> 00:44:19,378
Of course.
Hannah, get up in that chair.

539
00:44:19,462 --> 00:44:21,380
We are going to make you
look beautiful.

540
00:44:21,464 --> 00:44:23,132
Beautiful? What for?

541
00:44:23,216 --> 00:44:25,759
He's going to practice on you
for a beauty parlor.

542
00:44:28,513 --> 00:44:30,931
You're not gonna put mud
on my face, are you?

543
00:44:31,016 --> 00:44:33,350
Ah, we are going to take some off.

544
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:36,979
Make me look beautiful?

545
00:44:37,063 --> 00:44:39,690
Sure. We can't make you
look any worse.

546
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:42,923
Hannah!

547
00:44:42,948 --> 00:44:45,386
Oh, there's Mrs.
Shoemaker for the laundry.

548
00:44:45,447 --> 00:44:47,489
That's all right.
I'll give it to her.

549
00:44:47,574 --> 00:44:50,325
- You sit here and enjoy yourself.
- What?

550
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:54,079
I know.
I've seen you making eyes.

551
00:44:56,082 --> 00:44:59,460
Don't pay any attention to Mr. Jaeckel.

552
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:04,715
- I like your shop since we fixed it up.
- Mm-hmm.

553
00:45:05,967 --> 00:45:08,052
I wish I had a business like this.

554
00:45:08,136 --> 00:45:10,512
There's no future in housework.

555
00:45:10,597 --> 00:45:13,515
Maybe if I save my money
I can have a barbershop someday.

556
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,893
But I can never save.

557
00:45:15,977 --> 00:45:19,271
Money slips through my fingers
like that.

558
00:45:19,355 --> 00:45:22,566
Trouble is, I've always lived up
to every penny I've earned.

559
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:26,320
Why shouldn't I? You're here today
and gone tomorrow. And then where are you?

560
00:45:28,073 --> 00:45:30,199
- Do you believe in God?
- Well -

561
00:45:30,283 --> 00:45:34,119
I do. But if there wasn't one,
would you live any different?

562
00:45:34,204 --> 00:45:38,373
I wouldn't. Life could be wonderful
if people'd leave you alone.

563
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:41,418
Things are looking brighter now.

564
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:45,172
Maybe you're the reason,
saving Commander Schultz's life.

565
00:45:45,256 --> 00:45:49,384
Funny how they've left us alone lately.
Seems too good to be true.

566
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:58,267
Do you ever daydream?

567
00:45:58,352 --> 00:45:59,685
I do.

568
00:46:00,687 --> 00:46:04,524
That's the only time I'm really happy -
dreaming.

569
00:46:04,608 --> 00:46:06,109
Back.

570
00:46:08,403 --> 00:46:12,448
Sometimes I get so carried away I don't
know what I'm doing. Aren't you like that?

571
00:46:14,493 --> 00:46:16,619
- Do you know we're very much alike?
- Are we?

572
00:46:16,703 --> 00:46:18,287
Yeah.
We're both absentminded.

573
00:46:18,372 --> 00:46:19,997
- You think so?
- Yes.

574
00:46:24,044 --> 00:46:26,379
- I like absentminded people.
- Mm-hmm.

575
00:46:31,218 --> 00:46:33,469
Do you know the story about the man
that put his watch in boiling water...

576
00:46:33,554 --> 00:46:34,971
and held the egg in his hand?

577
00:46:35,055 --> 00:46:36,806
No!

578
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:39,350
Very good.

579
00:46:43,272 --> 00:46:45,189
They say all great men
are absentminded.

580
00:46:45,274 --> 00:46:48,109
It's a sign they're smart.

581
00:46:48,193 --> 00:46:50,194
My folks didn't think so.

582
00:46:53,198 --> 00:46:55,825
Of course there's an excuse for you.
You were injured in the war.

583
00:46:55,909 --> 00:46:58,578
I was born that way.

584
00:47:06,545 --> 00:47:08,462
Wonder why women
never grow whiskers.

585
00:47:08,547 --> 00:47:10,339
Hmm? What?

586
00:47:10,424 --> 00:47:11,924
I s -

587
00:47:14,928 --> 00:47:16,929
What -

588
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,808
- Oh, my!
- Isn't that foolish of me!

589
00:47:20,893 --> 00:47:23,561
I could kick myself in the shins, I could.

590
00:47:24,771 --> 00:47:26,939
I'll give you a shampoo.

591
00:47:27,024 --> 00:47:28,524
That's good.

592
00:47:34,615 --> 00:47:35,948
Voilà.

593
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:41,786
Gee.

594
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:44,623
Ain't I cute!

595
00:47:47,084 --> 00:47:48,627
How'd you do it?

596
00:47:50,588 --> 00:47:53,215
- You should try it on yourself.
- Huh?

597
00:47:53,299 --> 00:47:55,800
If you were fixed up,
you'd look handsome.

598
00:47:55,885 --> 00:47:57,761
- Yes?
- Yes!

599
00:47:59,805 --> 00:48:01,056
No.

600
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,850
Four pecks a pound! New potatoes!

601
00:48:03,935 --> 00:48:07,145
There's the potato man.
I have to go.

602
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,984
Potatoes!

603
00:48:13,069 --> 00:48:14,736
One, please!

604
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:24,037
Take it easy there.

605
00:48:25,331 --> 00:48:27,332
Well, did you hurt yourself?

606
00:48:32,838 --> 00:48:35,090
- Careful next time.
- Here's another one.

607
00:48:39,011 --> 00:48:40,887
How do you do?

608
00:48:48,771 --> 00:48:52,440
Something's happened. I know it.
The storm troopers, they helped me up.

609
00:48:53,484 --> 00:48:55,902
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if they stopped hating us...

610
00:48:55,987 --> 00:48:59,614
if they'd leave us alone and let us
go about our business like we used to.

611
00:48:59,699 --> 00:49:03,201
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we didn't
have to leave and go to another country?

612
00:49:03,286 --> 00:49:04,662
I don't want to go away.

613
00:49:04,687 --> 00:49:08,355
With all the hardship and the
persecution, I love it here.

614
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:11,001
Perhaps we don't have to go.

615
00:49:11,085 --> 00:49:14,921
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if they'd let us live and be happy again?

616
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,917
Period.

617
00:49:58,757 --> 00:50:00,257
<i>Danke schoen.</i>

618
00:50:05,847 --> 00:50:07,348
Ah.

619
00:50:23,448 --> 00:50:26,075
Nothing works! Not a decent pen!
Not even a sharp pencil!

620
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:29,661
I'm surrounded by nothing but incompetent,
stupid, sterile stenographers!

621
00:50:29,746 --> 00:50:32,247
- I'll get you a pen.
- Don't bother.

622
00:50:32,332 --> 00:50:34,249
I won't send it.

623
00:50:34,334 --> 00:50:36,335
Get out! Get out! Get out!

624
00:50:41,633 --> 00:50:46,136
We've just discovered the most wonderful,
the most marvelous poison gas!

625
00:50:47,555 --> 00:50:50,057
It will kill everybody!

626
00:50:50,141 --> 00:50:52,393
All right, later, later, later.

627
00:50:52,477 --> 00:50:54,395
<i>B-76 to see Herr Herring.</i>

628
00:50:54,479 --> 00:50:55,896
- Who's that?
- A lady.

629
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,190
- My secret agent.
- Hmm.

630
00:50:58,274 --> 00:51:00,733
Your secret agent.
Tell her to come here.

631
00:51:00,818 --> 00:51:02,443
Have B-76 come right in.

632
00:51:03,445 --> 00:51:04,862
Hail Hynkel.

633
00:51:04,947 --> 00:51:06,583
Oh, Garbitsch, what do
you hear from Epstein?

634
00:51:06,608 --> 00:51:07,389
Most encouraging.

635
00:51:07,449 --> 00:51:10,111
Our agent reports that all the
board of directors are Aryans,

636
00:51:10,136 --> 00:51:11,852
so the loan is bound
to go through.

637
00:51:11,912 --> 00:51:14,288
- Good.
- Hail Hynkel.

638
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,501
Come here.

639
00:51:21,296 --> 00:51:21,953
Well?

640
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:23,947
The men are planning a
strike at the arms factory.

641
00:51:24,007 --> 00:51:26,342
- Who's the leader?
- There were five of them.

642
00:51:26,427 --> 00:51:29,595
- Have them shot.
- They were, Your Excellency.

643
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,556
Oh. Hmm.

644
00:51:32,349 --> 00:51:34,141
How many do you say were going on strike?

645
00:51:34,166 --> 00:51:35,876
The whole factory... 3,000 of them.

646
00:51:35,936 --> 00:51:39,063
Have them all shot. I don't want
any of my workers dissatisfied.

647
00:51:39,148 --> 00:51:41,315
But, Your Excellency,
these men are skilled craftsmen.

648
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,360
Why not let them work till
they can train others, then shoot them?

649
00:51:44,445 --> 00:51:46,112
We cannot afford to be lenient!

650
00:51:46,196 --> 00:51:48,739
The whole rhythm of production
will be affected if you shoot them now.

651
00:51:48,824 --> 00:51:51,576
"Rhythm of production."
All right, have your rhythms.

652
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,882
You may instruct your operatives
to spare the strikers

653
00:51:53,907 --> 00:51:55,562
and permit them to return to work...

654
00:51:55,622 --> 00:51:57,707
but to mark them
for future reference.

655
00:51:58,709 --> 00:52:00,501
That is my department.
I'll attend to that.

656
00:52:00,586 --> 00:52:02,211
This way, madam.

657
00:52:06,967 --> 00:52:10,720
Strange. These strike leaders - they're
all brunettes. Not a blonde amongst them.

658
00:52:10,804 --> 00:52:12,763
Brunettes are troublemakers.
They're worse than the Jews.

659
00:52:12,848 --> 00:52:14,307
Then wipe them out.

660
00:52:14,391 --> 00:52:16,684
<i>Doucement.
Not so fast.</i>

661
00:52:16,768 --> 00:52:19,562
We get rid of the Jews first.
Then concentrate on the brunettes.

662
00:52:19,646 --> 00:52:23,107
We shall never have peace
until we have a pure Aryan race.

663
00:52:23,192 --> 00:52:24,484
How wonderful.

664
00:52:24,568 --> 00:52:27,487
Tomainia, a nation
of blue-eyed blondes.

665
00:52:27,571 --> 00:52:30,198
Why not a blonde Europe,
a blonde Asia, a blonde America?

666
00:52:30,282 --> 00:52:32,200
- A blonde world.
- And a brunette dictator.

667
00:52:32,284 --> 00:52:33,493
Dictator of the world.

668
00:52:33,577 --> 00:52:35,203
Why not?

669
00:52:35,287 --> 00:52:37,038
<i>Aut Caesar aut nulles.</i>

670
00:52:37,122 --> 00:52:39,415
The world is effete, worn-out, afraid.

671
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,625
No nation would dare to oppose you.

672
00:52:41,709 --> 00:52:44,169
- Dictator of the world!
- It's your destiny.

673
00:52:44,253 --> 00:52:47,339
We'll kill off the Jews,
wipe out the brunettes.

674
00:52:47,423 --> 00:52:50,509
Then will come forth our dream -
a pure Aryan race.

675
00:52:50,593 --> 00:52:53,637
- Beautiful blonde Aryans.
- They will love you. They will adore you.

676
00:52:53,721 --> 00:52:56,973
- They will worship you as a god!
- No, no! You mustn't say it!

677
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:03,271
You make me afraid of myself.

678
00:53:11,572 --> 00:53:13,782
Yes, dictator of the world.

679
00:53:13,866 --> 00:53:15,784
We'll start
with the invasion of Osterlich.

680
00:53:15,868 --> 00:53:17,786
After that we won't have to fight.
We can bluff.

681
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:19,788
Nation after nation will capitulate.

682
00:53:19,872 --> 00:53:22,707
Within two years
the world will be under your thumb!

683
00:53:22,792 --> 00:53:26,086
Leave me.
I want to be alone.

684
00:53:56,492 --> 00:53:59,911
<i>Aut Caesar aut nulles.</i>

685
00:53:59,996 --> 00:54:02,581
Emperor of the world!

686
00:54:05,668 --> 00:54:08,086

Brahms' "Hungarian Dance No. 5."</i>

690
00:57:57,063 --> 00:57:58,772

Adenoid Hynkel's address...</i>

of the Double Cross.</i>

694
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,331
Seems like the old days again,
don't it?

695
00:58:16,415 --> 00:58:18,667
I wonder how long
they are going to last.

696
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:20,335
Don't you read the papers?

697
00:58:20,419 --> 00:58:23,505
It is rumored that Hynkel is going to
give the Jewish people back their rights.

698
00:58:23,589 --> 00:58:25,257
Hmm. Maybe.

699
00:58:25,341 --> 00:58:26,842
What do you want?

700
00:58:26,926 --> 00:58:30,595
Business is much better.
Nobody interferes with us anymore.

701
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,889
Now don't that make you feel good?

702
00:58:32,974 --> 00:58:34,558
No, sir.

703
00:58:34,642 --> 00:58:36,049
The trouble, Mr. Jaeckel, is,

704
00:58:36,074 --> 00:58:39,128
you're so used to bad times
you're unhappy without them.

705
00:58:39,188 --> 00:58:42,315
Mary? Mary!
Get my Sunday shoes.

706
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,193
- You'll find them on the window sill.
- All right.

707
00:58:45,278 --> 00:58:48,363
- I can't find the shawl.
- Don't bother. I've got the shawl.

708
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:50,949
- What's going on upstairs?
- It's Hannah.

709
00:58:51,033 --> 00:58:53,285
They're dressing her up
to go out this evening.

710
00:58:53,369 --> 00:58:56,288
- Is that so?
- She's got a beau.

711
00:58:56,372 --> 00:58:58,498
- Who is it?
- The barber.

712
00:58:59,292 --> 00:59:01,459
Now turn around.

713
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:05,130
Oh, my dear, those hands.

714
00:59:05,214 --> 00:59:08,800
- What's the matter with them?
- Those calluses - they're so rough.

715
00:59:08,885 --> 00:59:11,678
- Maybe I'd better not go.
- Don't be foolish.

716
00:59:11,762 --> 00:59:13,763
He knows you do housework.

717
00:59:13,848 --> 00:59:16,850
Wait a minute. I'll get a pair
of mittens from Mrs. Morris.

718
00:59:16,934 --> 00:59:20,562
- Mrs. Morris?
- Yes, Mrs. Jaeckel? Come in!

719
00:59:20,646 --> 00:59:23,106
Aggie.

720
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:25,482
- Yeah?
- See if he's ready yet.

721
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:27,818
All right.

722
00:59:39,998 --> 00:59:43,334
Not yet.
He's polishing a bald man's head.

723
00:59:50,258 --> 00:59:51,842
Bad news.

724
00:59:51,927 --> 00:59:53,969
The invasion of Osterlich
will have to be delayed.

725
00:59:54,054 --> 00:59:57,306
- What?
- Epstein refuses to lend us the money.

726
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:59,350
Mmm.

727
00:59:59,434 --> 01:00:01,393
Epstein refuses, huh?

728
01:00:05,732 --> 01:00:07,191
Send for Schultz!

729
01:00:08,276 --> 01:00:09,693
Commander Schultz.

730
01:00:09,778 --> 01:00:11,695
Epstein refuses!

731
01:00:14,783 --> 01:00:17,493
That contemptible Epstein!
What did he say?

732
01:00:17,577 --> 01:00:19,703
He complained
of the persecution of his people...

733
01:00:19,788 --> 01:00:23,707
and said under no circumstances would he
have any dealings with a medieval maniac.

734
01:00:23,792 --> 01:00:27,127
He'll deal with a medieval maniac
more than he thinks!

735
01:00:30,048 --> 01:00:32,716
First I shall deal with "his people."

736
01:00:32,801 --> 01:00:34,343
Your Excellency?

737
01:00:34,427 --> 01:00:36,553
Schultz, call out the storm troopers.

738
01:00:36,638 --> 01:00:39,807
We're going to stage a little
medieval entertainment in the ghetto.

739
01:00:39,891 --> 01:00:42,893
At such a time, Your Excellency,
I think it's ill-advised.

740
01:00:42,978 --> 01:00:44,228
What?

741
01:00:44,312 --> 01:00:46,814
Demonstrations of this kind
are demoralizing the whole country.

742
01:00:46,898 --> 01:00:48,565
Indeed.

743
01:00:49,734 --> 01:00:52,653
And since when have you been
so concerned about the ghetto?

744
01:00:52,737 --> 01:00:56,031
I speak in the interests of our party
and for the cause of humanity.

745
01:00:57,909 --> 01:00:59,201
Schultz.

746
01:00:59,285 --> 01:01:01,161
You need a vacation.

747
01:01:02,247 --> 01:01:03,747
Fresh air.

748
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:08,793
A little outdoor exercise.

749
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:12,714
I shall send you
to a concentration camp.

750
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:14,924
Guards!

751
01:01:15,718 --> 01:01:17,635
Place Commander Schultz under arrest.

752
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,929
Very well,
but remember my words.

753
01:01:20,014 --> 01:01:22,890
Your cause is doomed to failure
because it's built on the stupid,

754
01:01:22,915 --> 01:01:24,875
ruthless persecution
of innocent people.

755
01:01:24,935 --> 01:01:26,853
Your policy is worse than a crime.

756
01:01:26,937 --> 01:01:29,105
It's a tragic blunder.

757
01:01:29,189 --> 01:01:31,441
Traitor! Traitor!

758
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:35,111
You're nothing
but a double-dyed democrat!

759
01:01:57,801 --> 01:02:01,304
Schultz, why have you forsaken me?

760
01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:16,944
Excellency, here are the notes
for your speech.

761
01:02:17,029 --> 01:02:18,696
Thank you.

762
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,584
I'll not need them.

763
01:02:31,668 --> 01:02:34,420

01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:44,595
There's nice money
to be made in chickens.

860
01:10:07,494 --> 01:10:09,286
Look at that star.

861
01:10:11,206 --> 01:10:13,165
Isn't it beautiful?

862
01:10:16,628 --> 01:10:20,297
One thing - Hynkel with all his power
can never touch that.

863
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:25,970
It's all right now.
The coast is clear. Listen.

864
01:10:26,054 --> 01:10:28,347
Commander Schultz escaped.
He's hiding in my cellar.

865
01:10:28,431 --> 01:10:29,390
What?

866
01:10:29,474 --> 01:10:33,060
He's holding a meeting at midnight
and he wants you to be there.

867
01:10:33,144 --> 01:10:34,895
Hannah, you too come down...

868
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,730
and help Mrs. Jaeckel with the supper.

869
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:38,315
All right. I'll be down.

870
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:44,822
I don't understand it.

871
01:10:44,906 --> 01:10:47,491
This crazy midnight supper.

872
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:50,411
What does this Commander Schultz
want of us?

873
01:10:50,495 --> 01:10:52,580
He wants us to blow up the palace.

874
01:10:52,664 --> 01:10:54,331
What?

875
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:57,835
We Jewish people shouldn't
get mixed up in such a business.

876
01:10:57,919 --> 01:11:01,547
I know it, but Commander Schultz is such
a good talker, he has them all hypnotized.

877
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:03,799
I knew he was up to some mischief.

878
01:11:03,883 --> 01:11:05,509
Sure, he is!

879
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:08,220
I came in the kitchen this evening...

880
01:11:08,305 --> 01:11:11,015
and found him putting a coin
in one of your puddings.

881
01:11:11,099 --> 01:11:13,558
Putting a coin in one of the puddings?

882
01:11:13,642 --> 01:11:17,312
But don't worry. I've fixed everything.
Wait and see.

883
01:11:17,396 --> 01:11:22,108
Gentlemen, may I claim
your indulgence for a moment?

884
01:11:22,192 --> 01:11:26,613
We are here tonight
to rid the country of a tyrant.

885
01:11:27,448 --> 01:11:30,241
In order to carry out this plan,
one of us must die.

886
01:11:33,329 --> 01:11:36,706
In ancient times,
the Aryan tribe of Langobardians...

887
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:39,667
made human sacrifice to the god Thor.

888
01:11:41,045 --> 01:11:43,963
At a feast by lottery
the victim was chosen.

889
01:11:44,048 --> 01:11:47,634
Tonight at this feast
one of you will be chosen.

890
01:11:51,639 --> 01:11:53,723
Each man will receive a pudding.

891
01:11:53,807 --> 01:11:56,267
Concealed in one of these is a coin.

892
01:11:56,352 --> 01:11:59,604
Whoever gets that coin must give up his
life for the liberation of his people.

893
01:11:59,688 --> 01:12:04,400
But he will join the long line
of history's noble martyrs...

894
01:12:04,485 --> 01:12:08,237
and will rid his country of a tyrant.

895
01:12:11,408 --> 01:12:12,408
Ooh!

896
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:21,918
I know that it is the wish
of all of us...

897
01:12:22,002 --> 01:12:24,837
to be chosen this night
to die for Tomainia.

898
01:12:25,673 --> 01:12:28,591
Much as I should like
to participate in this ordeal...

899
01:12:28,676 --> 01:12:30,176
I cannot.

900
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:31,761
Why?

901
01:12:34,807 --> 01:12:37,684
Don't you understand?
He's too well-known.

902
01:12:37,768 --> 01:12:40,436
It must be done by somebody like us.

903
01:12:40,521 --> 01:12:42,271
I can't see it like that.

904
01:12:42,356 --> 01:12:46,192
Gentlemen, if this is a question of
my honor, it's very embarrassing.

905
01:12:47,861 --> 01:12:51,155
Commander Schultz,
I apologize for my friend.

906
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:54,616
And let me say on behalf
of myself and the others...

907
01:12:54,701 --> 01:12:58,537
that we consider it a great privilege
to die for our country.

908
01:12:59,539 --> 01:13:04,751
Very well then. Gentlemen, I shall now
retire until fate has chosen the liberator.

909
01:13:08,214 --> 01:13:10,632
Until then, hail Hynk -

910
01:13:10,717 --> 01:13:13,051
Oh, what am I saying?

911
01:13:13,136 --> 01:13:17,973
Gentlemen, we have pledged our honor.

912
01:13:18,057 --> 01:13:19,266
Proceed.

913
01:16:25,576 --> 01:16:28,244
Gentlemen, the coin is here.

914
01:16:34,668 --> 01:16:36,419
What's the meaning of all this?

915
01:16:36,503 --> 01:16:38,004
Somebody made a fool of us.

916
01:16:38,088 --> 01:16:40,173
- You're quite right. I did.
- What?

917
01:16:40,257 --> 01:16:42,300
I put a coin in every pudding.

918
01:16:45,429 --> 01:16:47,263
Mr. Jaeckel!

919
01:16:47,348 --> 01:16:52,310
Blowing up palaces and wanting to kill
people. We're in enough trouble as it is.

920
01:16:53,604 --> 01:16:57,106
Hannah's right.
We've all been foolish.

921
01:16:57,191 --> 01:17:00,693
Our place is at home,
looking after our own affairs.

922
01:17:00,778 --> 01:17:02,654
Good night.

923
01:17:02,738 --> 01:17:04,238
What's this?

924
01:17:04,323 --> 01:17:05,823
Good night.

925
01:17:10,454 --> 01:17:12,455
Good morning.

926
01:17:24,134 --> 01:17:27,053
By the papers they are saying Commander
Schultz may be hiding in the ghetto.

927
01:17:27,137 --> 01:17:29,472
Here it is. Read it for yourself.

928
01:17:30,641 --> 01:17:32,642
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

929
01:17:32,726 --> 01:17:34,852
Hannah, here. Read that.

930
01:17:34,937 --> 01:17:36,729
"Mystery still surrounds
the disappearance...

931
01:17:36,814 --> 01:17:38,064
of ex-Commander Schultz.

932
01:17:38,148 --> 01:17:41,693
At police headquarters it was believed that
the commander may be hiding in the ghetto.

933
01:17:41,777 --> 01:17:45,697
A certain Jewish barber,
reported to be a friend of Schultz...

934
01:17:45,781 --> 01:17:47,657
is also wanted for questioning."

935
01:17:47,741 --> 01:17:48,741
Me?

936
01:17:48,826 --> 01:17:51,327
Well, if it's just for questioning,
it can't be serious.

937
01:17:51,412 --> 01:17:55,498
Meyerberg was only wanted for questioning,
and we never heard of him since.

938
01:17:55,582 --> 01:17:57,417
Shh!

939
01:18:06,175 --> 01:18:08,260
- Who is it?
- It's me - Mr. Mann.

940
01:18:11,764 --> 01:18:14,224
Hello, Jaeckel. How are you, Mr. Agar?

941
01:18:14,308 --> 01:18:16,601
- How are you, Mrs. Jaeckel?
- How do you do?

942
01:18:16,686 --> 01:18:18,520
Did you hear
what they're saying in the papers...

943
01:18:18,604 --> 01:18:20,272
about Commander Schultz
hiding in the ghetto?

944
01:18:20,356 --> 01:18:21,857
Oh, I know, I know.

945
01:18:21,941 --> 01:18:25,527
Well, don't you think that it's serious for
you if they find him here in the house?

946
01:18:25,611 --> 01:18:27,237
Shh!

947
01:18:27,321 --> 01:18:29,990
Don't you realize
there are spies everywhere?

948
01:18:30,074 --> 01:18:32,159
Spies?

949
01:18:33,870 --> 01:18:37,497
What's the matter with him?

950
01:18:37,582 --> 01:18:40,167
Didn't you read
he's wanted for questioning?

951
01:18:40,251 --> 01:18:42,085
Oy.

952
01:18:42,170 --> 01:18:43,503
Where's the commander?

953
01:18:43,588 --> 01:18:45,881
He's in the next room.

954
01:18:45,965 --> 01:18:47,466
Let me tell you.

955
01:18:47,550 --> 01:18:49,426
If Commander Schultz is found
in this house...

956
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:51,852
we'll all go to the
concentration camp for life

957
01:18:51,877 --> 01:18:54,121
and get our heads cut
off in the bargain.

958
01:18:54,182 --> 01:18:56,099
Am I giving you an argument?

959
01:18:56,184 --> 01:18:57,726
Then get rid of him.

960
01:18:57,810 --> 01:18:59,519
You can't throw him out.

961
01:18:59,604 --> 01:19:01,146
Of course not.

962
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:04,983
But I should like to know,
how long is he going to stay here?

963
01:19:05,068 --> 01:19:06,151
That's all.

964
01:19:06,235 --> 01:19:08,653
Come. Your breakfast is on the table.

965
01:19:08,738 --> 01:19:11,490
- Mr. Mann?
- Thank you.

966
01:19:11,574 --> 01:19:13,408
I have breakfast waiting at home.

967
01:19:14,994 --> 01:19:17,287
Take the other side of the street
and search every house.

968
01:19:20,333 --> 01:19:21,875
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

969
01:19:21,959 --> 01:19:24,169
- What's wrong now?
- They're looking for Commander Schultz.

970
01:19:24,253 --> 01:19:24,983
Commander Schultz?

971
01:19:25,008 --> 01:19:27,196
He's supposed to be hiding
in one of those houses.

972
01:19:27,256 --> 01:19:29,591
Oh, they're always looking
for somebody.

973
01:19:42,687 --> 01:19:45,106
- Who is it?
- It's me. Let me in!

974
01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:47,566
- For heaven's sake, hurry up!
- Open the door.

975
01:19:52,114 --> 01:19:53,614
- They're coming this way.
- What?

976
01:19:53,698 --> 01:19:56,200
The storm troopers are searching
every house.

977
01:19:56,284 --> 01:19:57,868
Quick! Tell the commander.

978
01:20:02,332 --> 01:20:03,415
Oh!

979
01:20:05,043 --> 01:20:06,544
- Did you tell him?
- Yes.

980
01:20:06,628 --> 01:20:07,233
What is it?

981
01:20:07,258 --> 01:20:09,070
The storm troopers, they're
going to search the house.

982
01:20:09,131 --> 01:20:09,861
What?

983
01:20:09,886 --> 01:20:12,073
You'd better get up on the roof.
Quick! Both of you!

984
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:14,802
Wait a minute!

985
01:20:14,886 --> 01:20:16,399
We can't leave all
these things about.

986
01:20:16,424 --> 01:20:18,246
That's right. All of
you, pack my valises.

987
01:20:20,142 --> 01:20:21,851
You pack this valise.

988
01:20:30,569 --> 01:20:32,736
- Clear this shelf. Quickly.
- Oh, yes.

989
01:20:35,323 --> 01:20:37,408
Pack this and this.

990
01:20:37,492 --> 01:20:40,411
Oh, this mustn't be found here.
Open the door.

991
01:20:46,585 --> 01:20:49,670
Listen! They are here!
Get up on the roof. Quick!

992
01:20:49,754 --> 01:20:52,506
- I'll take this.
- Be sure they don't leave anything behind.

993
01:20:52,591 --> 01:20:54,592
- My golf clubs.
- The hatbox!

994
01:20:57,762 --> 01:21:00,014
- Here. Take this.
- Come on! Let's hurry!

995
01:21:00,098 --> 01:21:01,682
- Where are you going?
- I'm going with him.

996
01:21:01,766 --> 01:21:03,559
You stay here. You'll see him later.
Here. Take this.

997
01:21:03,643 --> 01:21:05,519
- I'll meet you on the roof tonight.
- All right.

998
01:21:05,604 --> 01:21:07,104
Oh, take this.

999
01:21:11,359 --> 01:21:13,277
Come on. Quick! Come on.

1000
01:21:13,361 --> 01:21:16,363
Open in the name of Hynkel!

1001
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:25,079
- Stop!
- Huh?

1002
01:21:25,164 --> 01:21:27,290
- Look where you are.
- Look where?

1003
01:21:27,374 --> 01:21:29,000
Look where you are.

1004
01:21:29,084 --> 01:21:31,211
Wait, I can't - I can't see.
Wait a moment.

1005
01:21:31,879 --> 01:21:35,882
- My bag! You've dropped it!
- No, it's right here. Here it is.

1006
01:21:35,966 --> 01:21:37,050
Oh.

1007
01:21:42,848 --> 01:21:45,558
Don't drop the other one!
Don't drop the other one!

1008
01:21:45,643 --> 01:21:48,978
My golf clubs! Not my golf clubs!

1009
01:21:49,647 --> 01:21:51,606
Come off of there. They'll see you.

1010
01:21:52,983 --> 01:21:55,318
Quick! This way!

1011
01:22:00,699 --> 01:22:02,825
- Whoa! Steady!
- Mm-hmm.

1012
01:22:02,910 --> 01:22:04,869
Now be careful.

1013
01:22:04,954 --> 01:22:06,287
Yes, sir.

1014
01:22:06,372 --> 01:22:08,414
You were lucky
you didn't break your neck.

1015
01:22:08,499 --> 01:22:09,832
Yes, sir.

1016
01:22:14,171 --> 01:22:15,672
You'll pardon me.

1017
01:22:18,759 --> 01:22:19,842
Sorry.

1018
01:22:22,179 --> 01:22:24,806
You guard the back -
Wait a minute.

1019
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:26,849
I'm sorry.
I shall have to bother you again.

1020
01:22:28,102 --> 01:22:29,602
There he is!

1021
01:22:33,524 --> 01:22:35,817
Well, good morning. How are you?

1022
01:22:35,901 --> 01:22:37,694
Oh, so-so.

1023
01:22:37,778 --> 01:22:39,570
Commander Schultz, who's your friend?

1024
01:22:39,655 --> 01:22:41,948
Remember, your silence
will be appreciated.

1025
01:22:42,032 --> 01:22:43,700
- Yes, sir.
- Take him down to the wagon.

1026
01:22:43,784 --> 01:22:44,951
Come on.

1027
01:22:57,798 --> 01:23:00,133
- Hey! Where you going?
- To the smoking room.

1028
01:23:00,217 --> 01:23:02,384
Ah, come on! Down this way!

1029
01:23:51,851 --> 01:23:53,352
Osterlich.

1030
01:23:53,436 --> 01:23:54,436
<i>Ja.</i>

1031
01:25:27,529 --> 01:25:29,196
Gentlemen, I am pleased to announce...

1032
01:25:29,281 --> 01:25:32,783
that we are at last
ready to march on Osterlich.

1033
01:25:32,868 --> 01:25:35,619
This was made possible
by the enterprise and genius...

1034
01:25:35,704 --> 01:25:37,705
of Field Marshal Herring...

1035
01:25:37,789 --> 01:25:40,624
upon whom I shall now pin
a token of my regard.

1036
01:25:45,630 --> 01:25:50,551
<i>...der Wiener schnitzel -</i>

1037
01:25:57,142 --> 01:26:00,060
...da genius.

1038
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:08,402
Turn around. No. Ah, yes.

1039
01:26:21,166 --> 01:26:22,666
Gentlemen...

1040
01:26:24,335 --> 01:26:26,920
to Field Marshal Herring.

1041
01:26:27,004 --> 01:26:28,922
To the invasion of Osterlich.

1042
01:26:45,689 --> 01:26:46,689
Elephant.

1043
01:26:48,943 --> 01:26:52,195
Hello? Yes. Yes.

1044
01:26:52,279 --> 01:26:53,279
Wait.

1045
01:26:53,364 --> 01:26:55,615
Napaloni's mobilized his army
on the Osterlich front.

1046
01:26:55,699 --> 01:26:57,116
What?

1047
01:26:57,201 --> 01:26:59,619
Already 60,000 men are on the border.

1048
01:26:59,703 --> 01:27:01,204
He's going to take Osterlich!

1049
01:27:01,288 --> 01:27:03,081
I can't believe it.

1050
01:27:05,125 --> 01:27:07,752
You can't believe it?

1051
01:27:07,836 --> 01:27:10,463
But, Your Excellency, I -

1052
01:27:10,548 --> 01:27:12,507
- You let him steal a march on us!
- No, I -

1053
01:27:12,591 --> 01:27:15,093
You can't believe it?

1054
01:27:15,177 --> 01:27:19,639
I did everything that was -

1055
01:27:19,723 --> 01:27:23,476
I had the ground covered.

1056
01:27:31,151 --> 01:27:33,319
Haven't you any brains?

1057
01:27:33,404 --> 01:27:35,321
<i>..."Pinheaden"...</i>

1058
01:27:45,583 --> 01:27:47,250
No! No, no, no, no, no!

1059
01:27:47,334 --> 01:27:49,502
No, no, no, no, no!

1060
01:27:50,588 --> 01:27:52,922
No, no - No!

1061
01:27:53,007 --> 01:27:55,341
- Declare war on Napaloni!
- Napaloni?

1062
01:27:55,426 --> 01:27:57,125
Yes, Napaloni!
Listen, you blockhead!

1063
01:27:57,150 --> 01:27:59,786
Mobilize every division of
the army and the air force.

1064
01:27:59,847 --> 01:28:02,765
- Proceed to Bacteria and attack at once!
- But war will be the end of us.

1065
01:28:02,850 --> 01:28:04,017
- Do as I tell you.
- Madness.

1066
01:28:04,101 --> 01:28:05,851
- Shut up!
- Very well. Will you sign this?

1067
01:28:05,935 --> 01:28:08,186
- Yes, I'll - What is it?
- A declaration of war.

1068
01:28:08,271 --> 01:28:09,938
I'll sign it. A pen.

1069
01:28:10,023 --> 01:28:12,441
I'll sign it.

1070
01:28:18,364 --> 01:28:19,615
A pen!

1071
01:28:19,699 --> 01:28:21,867
I'll sign it! Napaloni.

1072
01:28:21,951 --> 01:28:24,703
<i>Der grosser peanut!
Der cheesy ravioli!</i>

1073
01:28:24,787 --> 01:28:26,330
There!

1074
01:28:26,414 --> 01:28:28,081
Hello?

1075
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:30,208
- It's Napaloni.
- Wait a minute.

1076
01:28:30,293 --> 01:28:32,210
Napaloni?

1077
01:28:32,295 --> 01:28:34,963
- You talk to him.
- What shall I say?

1078
01:28:35,048 --> 01:28:37,633
Be nice, affable, pleasant.

1079
01:28:40,762 --> 01:28:41,803
Hello?

1080
01:28:41,888 --> 01:28:44,306
Well, well, well. How are you?

1081
01:28:44,390 --> 01:28:46,183
Fine.

1082
01:28:46,267 --> 01:28:49,061
No, he hasn't been playing
very much lately.

1083
01:28:49,145 --> 01:28:51,480
You went around in '92? Really?

1084
01:28:53,399 --> 01:28:55,525
You want to speak to His Excellency?

1085
01:29:00,406 --> 01:29:02,491
Just now he's a little hoarse.

1086
01:29:02,575 --> 01:29:06,870
Hmm. No, no. I mean he can't talk.

1087
01:29:06,954 --> 01:29:09,122
May I take a message?

1088
01:29:09,874 --> 01:29:11,515
He says no doubt you've
heard of the movement

1089
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:13,109
of his troops on the
Osterlich front...

1090
01:29:13,169 --> 01:29:14,670
and he'd like to discuss
the matter with you.

1091
01:29:14,754 --> 01:29:16,463
Ask him to come here.

1092
01:29:16,547 --> 01:29:18,840
His Excellency would be delighted
to invite you to Tomainia...

1093
01:29:18,925 --> 01:29:20,717
where you could discuss the matter.

1094
01:29:21,844 --> 01:29:24,513
Very well.
I'll make the necessary arrangements.

1095
01:29:24,597 --> 01:29:26,515
Good-bye, Your Excellency.

1096
01:29:26,599 --> 01:29:27,849
He's coming.

1097
01:29:27,934 --> 01:29:30,352
Good. We'll give him the works.

1098
01:29:30,436 --> 01:29:32,771
We'll put on the greatest military show
the world has ever known!

1099
01:29:32,855 --> 01:29:37,067
Convinced of my strength, Napaloni will
leave the invasion of Osterlich to me.

1100
01:29:38,528 --> 01:29:40,028
What shall I do with this?

1101
01:29:40,113 --> 01:29:42,322
- What is it?
- Your declaration of war.

1102
01:29:45,493 --> 01:29:47,618
Peace is declared.

1103
01:29:50,038 --> 01:29:54,458
<i>2,975,000 eager citizens
are massed in the station square...</i>

1104
01:29:54,543 --> 01:29:57,128
<i>awaiting the arrival
of Benzine Napaloni.</i>

1105
01:29:57,212 --> 01:30:01,298
<i>Entering the station is our beloved Phooey,
ready to greet his distinguished guest.</i>

1106
01:30:01,383 --> 01:30:03,467
<i>This historic meeting
will cement a friendship...</i>

1107
01:30:03,552 --> 01:30:07,555
<i>that has long existed between our Phooey
and the dictator of Bacteria.</i>

1108
01:30:07,639 --> 01:30:08,973
Order... arms!

1109
01:30:09,057 --> 01:30:12,476
<i>His Excellency is about to greet
the Bacterian ambassador.</i>

1110
01:30:12,561 --> 01:30:14,645
- How do you do?
- Thank you, sir.

1111
01:30:15,814 --> 01:30:17,064
Garbitsch.

1112
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:20,651
See about the photography.

1113
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:23,904
When Their Excellencies meet...

1114
01:30:23,989 --> 01:30:26,282
tell the press to see that our Phooey
is well-photographed.

1115
01:30:26,366 --> 01:30:28,159
- Full face, not the back of his head.
- Yes, sir.

1116
01:30:28,243 --> 01:30:31,495
<i>Benzino Napaloni's private train
is now coming into the station.</i>

1117
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:33,664
<i>And from a pink and white car...</i>

1118
01:30:33,749 --> 01:30:35,875
<i>Napaloni and his wife will
step onto a crimson carpet...</i>

1119
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:36,608
<i>Present arms!</i>

1120
01:30:36,668 --> 01:30:39,253
<i>where Adenoid Hynkel will deliver
his address of welcome.</i>

1121
01:30:51,016 --> 01:30:52,683
What's the matter with this stupid -

1122
01:30:53,935 --> 01:30:55,603
Hey! What's all of this-a mix-up-a?

1123
01:30:55,687 --> 01:30:57,521
Come on. They've gone too far.

1124
01:30:59,024 --> 01:31:01,942
At ease! Bring along the carpet.

1125
01:31:02,027 --> 01:31:04,195
Papa, why can't we get out here?

1126
01:31:04,279 --> 01:31:06,947
- There is no carpet.
- Who cares about a carpet?

1127
01:31:07,032 --> 01:31:10,534
Il Dig-a-Ditchy, me - Napaloni.
I never get out without a carpet.

1128
01:31:10,619 --> 01:31:11,702
Hmm, hmm -

1129
01:31:16,208 --> 01:31:18,751
Come on.
Lay it down here. Quick.

1130
01:31:18,835 --> 01:31:20,294
- Hurry up!
- It's going back again!

1131
01:31:20,378 --> 01:31:21,504
What?

1132
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:27,926
What do you do? You salami?

1133
01:31:30,137 --> 01:31:32,555
Let's get out!
Let's get out while it's stopping!

1134
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:34,057
Shut up!

1135
01:31:37,770 --> 01:31:39,938
Hurry. Quick. Put it down.

1136
01:31:41,232 --> 01:31:43,107
Take it away. Take it away.

1137
01:31:43,192 --> 01:31:46,653
Stay here. Stay here
until they've made up their mind.

1138
01:31:51,951 --> 01:31:54,744
You got-a the carpet?
Well, put 'em-a down!

1139
01:31:55,579 --> 01:31:57,664
Hmm. Oh, come on, come on.

1140
01:32:01,085 --> 01:32:03,002
- Here he is.
- Ah!

1141
01:32:04,338 --> 01:32:05,922
- My friend!
- Napaloni!

1142
01:32:09,009 --> 01:32:11,344
- This is indeed a pleasure.
- Thank you.

1143
01:32:11,428 --> 01:32:14,639
Welcome to Tomainia. This way.

1144
01:32:14,723 --> 01:32:16,099
Pictures, Your Excellencies?

1145
01:32:16,183 --> 01:32:18,518
Oh, sure. Salute!

1146
01:32:18,602 --> 01:32:20,103
Another one, please.

1147
01:32:20,187 --> 01:32:22,605
Ah, this is really a pleasure
to be here, my friend Hynkel.

1148
01:32:23,357 --> 01:32:25,441
Oh, you want another picture?
Just a moment.

1149
01:32:25,526 --> 01:32:26,526
There.

1150
01:32:31,532 --> 01:32:33,783
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- My bambino!

1151
01:32:33,868 --> 01:32:35,827
- All right. It's all right-a, Mama.
- Get rid of those men.

1152
01:32:35,911 --> 01:32:37,036
- Where is my ambassador?
- Dismissed.

1153
01:32:37,121 --> 01:32:38,872
- There you are. Hello, Spook.
- Your Excellency.

1154
01:32:38,956 --> 01:32:41,708
How do you feel?
Good! Look after Mama.

1155
01:32:41,792 --> 01:32:43,543
Oh, Hynkie, did you meet-a my wife?

1156
01:32:43,627 --> 01:32:44,752
- Your wife?
- That's her.

1157
01:32:44,837 --> 01:32:45,837
- I -
- Let's go.

1158
01:32:47,298 --> 01:32:50,216
Tomainia! Very nice. Very nice.

1159
01:32:51,969 --> 01:32:54,345
Present... arms!

1160
01:32:54,430 --> 01:32:58,224
Napaloni! Napaloni!

1161
01:33:09,903 --> 01:33:11,695
Clock is a-two minutes-a slow.

1162
01:33:12,405 --> 01:33:13,822
This way.

1163
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:31,089
Napaloni! Napaloni!

1164
01:33:31,174 --> 01:33:32,674
Napaloni!

1165
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:39,932
- It's-a very nice-a people.
- Hmm?

1166
01:33:40,016 --> 01:33:43,769
- I say, the people are very nice.
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

1167
01:33:45,688 --> 01:33:47,189
- He is my husband!
- Keep back!

1168
01:33:47,273 --> 01:33:48,440
- You make a mistake!
- Let me go!

1169
01:33:48,524 --> 01:33:50,192
- You make a big-a mistake-a!
- Get back!

1170
01:33:50,276 --> 01:33:51,485
Please!

1171
01:33:53,488 --> 01:33:55,697
At all costs, Napaloni shall not
invade Osterlich.

1172
01:33:55,782 --> 01:33:57,366
That country belongs to me.

1173
01:33:57,450 --> 01:34:00,577
At this meeting we shall not
discuss the Osterlich situation.

1174
01:34:00,662 --> 01:34:04,039
This interview is solely to impress
upon him the force of your personality.

1175
01:34:04,123 --> 01:34:07,292
- Hmm.
- To make him feel your superiority.

1176
01:34:07,377 --> 01:34:08,669
Heh.

1177
01:34:08,753 --> 01:34:10,921
This man Napaloni
is aggressive, domineering.

1178
01:34:11,005 --> 01:34:13,298
Before we make our demands,
we must put him in his place.

1179
01:34:13,383 --> 01:34:16,301
- Precisely. But how?
- By means of applied psychology.

1180
01:34:16,386 --> 01:34:19,221
In other words,
by making him feel inferior.

1181
01:34:19,305 --> 01:34:21,306
This can be done in many subtle ways.

1182
01:34:21,391 --> 01:34:24,476
For instance, at this interview,
I have so arranged...

1183
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:26,937
that he will always be
looking up at you...

1184
01:34:27,021 --> 01:34:28,647
you looking down at him.

1185
01:34:28,731 --> 01:34:31,274
At all times his position
will be inferior.

1186
01:34:31,359 --> 01:34:33,151
Mmm. Excellent.

1187
01:34:33,236 --> 01:34:37,406
Then again, we shall seat him here
beside your bust...

1188
01:34:37,490 --> 01:34:40,909
so that if you relax,
that will always be glaring at him.

1189
01:34:40,994 --> 01:34:43,328
And? Oh.

1190
01:34:43,413 --> 01:34:44,871
Where is he now?

1191
01:34:44,956 --> 01:34:47,791
Resting.
When he arrives, I have arranged...

1192
01:34:47,875 --> 01:34:50,751
that he shall enter
from the far end of the room.

1193
01:34:50,836 --> 01:34:53,087
Another psychological triumph.

1194
01:34:53,171 --> 01:34:56,590
He will have the embarrassment of walking
the entire length of the floor toward you.

1195
01:34:56,675 --> 01:34:59,051
Very good.

1196
01:35:01,388 --> 01:35:02,680
Yes?

1197
01:35:02,764 --> 01:35:05,516
<i>His Excellency
Signor Napaloni is now leaving his room.</i>

1198
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:09,103
He's coming! He's coming!
Quick, get me a flower. A flower.

1199
01:35:09,187 --> 01:35:11,439
Remember, at all times you must be
above him, before him.

1200
01:35:11,523 --> 01:35:13,441
Entering or leaving,
you must be first.

1201
01:35:19,865 --> 01:35:22,033
Hello, Hynkie!

1202
01:35:22,117 --> 01:35:25,953
<i>Wie Gootz! Wie geht's!</i>

1203
01:35:26,038 --> 01:35:27,997
How-a you feel?

1204
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:34,378
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Ah, my brother dictator!

1205
01:35:35,172 --> 01:35:37,131
You are a nice little man, a-Hynkie!

1206
01:35:37,215 --> 01:35:40,801
I'm so glad to see you again.

1207
01:35:40,886 --> 01:35:43,471
And my friend the Garbitsch!
Hello!

1208
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:47,058
Ah, this is a lovely place.

1209
01:35:47,142 --> 01:35:50,144
I feel-a fine.
I just had a nice-a cold shower.

1210
01:35:50,228 --> 01:35:54,190
And that bathtub - as soon as you get the
plumbing fixed, it'll be in-a good-a shape.

1211
01:35:55,567 --> 01:35:57,401
Your Excellency, won't you sit down.

1212
01:35:57,486 --> 01:35:58,986
Oh, shoot, shoot.

1213
01:36:20,467 --> 01:36:23,636
Well-a, Hynkie, my dictator friend, you -

1214
01:36:28,767 --> 01:36:30,351
I must be-a growing.

1215
01:36:32,019 --> 01:36:34,187
Not sure why they gave me
a baby stool.

1216
01:36:42,863 --> 01:36:46,199
This-a stool is not for me.
I like it-a better up-a-stairs here.

1217
01:36:46,283 --> 01:36:48,409
You know-a something, Garbitsch?
This is a lovely country.

1218
01:36:48,494 --> 01:36:49,953
Very nice-a people.

1219
01:36:50,037 --> 01:36:52,455
I thought the public extremely enthusiastic
on your arrival.

1220
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:54,874
Sure. They like to see new faces.

1221
01:36:58,379 --> 01:37:02,090
I'm sorry for the mishap that occurred
to Madam Napaloni at the railroad station.

1222
01:37:02,174 --> 01:37:04,008
What's that? What's that?

1223
01:37:04,093 --> 01:37:08,054
I'm sorry for the Napaloni
that occurred at the - at the rail -

1224
01:37:08,889 --> 01:37:11,141
Madam Napaloni at the railway station.

1225
01:37:11,892 --> 01:37:15,311
Oh, she's not used to public life.
She can't take it.

1226
01:37:15,396 --> 01:37:16,479
Match.

1227
01:37:16,564 --> 01:37:18,314
Oh - I'm sorry. I'm -

1228
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:21,901
No, that's all right.
Don't apologize. I find-a one.

1229
01:37:23,654 --> 01:37:26,906
I am simply crazy about this a-palace.

1230
01:37:26,991 --> 01:37:29,909
Ivory and gold -
that makes a lovely combination.

1231
01:37:29,994 --> 01:37:33,413
Gets away from that gingerbread idea.
Say, tell me something-a, Garbitsch.

1232
01:37:34,498 --> 01:37:35,999
What's on the program?

1233
01:37:36,083 --> 01:37:38,334
- There's the grand ball this evening.
- Grand ball?

1234
01:37:38,419 --> 01:37:41,504
The grand ball. And this afternoon,
a review of the army.

1235
01:37:41,589 --> 01:37:43,548
Review of the army?
Well, that won't take-a long.

1236
01:37:43,632 --> 01:37:47,093
- I'm afraid it will.
- Oh? So you got a big army, huh?

1237
01:37:47,178 --> 01:37:49,512
Modesty forbids.

1238
01:37:50,431 --> 01:37:52,182
Yes, seems I've heard
something about it.

1239
01:37:52,266 --> 01:37:54,601
If I'm gonna review the army,
I think I'll get me a shave.

1240
01:37:54,685 --> 01:37:57,187
- We have a barbershop in the palace.
- Is that so?

1241
01:37:58,105 --> 01:38:00,481
Hynkie, you look a little blue
under the gills.

1242
01:38:00,566 --> 01:38:03,443
- What do you say we take a shave together?
- I should be delighted.

1243
01:38:03,527 --> 01:38:05,486
- Good!
- Very well. This way.

1244
01:38:15,371 --> 01:38:17,873
Ah, this is the barbershop.
I can-a smell 'em.

1245
01:38:25,632 --> 01:38:27,549
Ah, now this is-a sweet -
a-very sweet.

1246
01:38:27,634 --> 01:38:29,228
Do you like it? It was
the emperor's library.

1247
01:38:29,253 --> 01:38:30,326
Makes a good a-barbershop.

1248
01:38:30,386 --> 01:38:32,037
Too old fashioned. I
want something modern.

1249
01:38:32,062 --> 01:38:32,662
Is that so?

1250
01:38:32,722 --> 01:38:35,807
You see, when I get shaved, I'm very
nervous. I like something to look at.

1251
01:38:35,892 --> 01:38:37,893
So I'm putting in glass
walls and ceiling...

1252
01:38:37,977 --> 01:38:40,812
so that when my head is turned this way,
I shall have a view of the mountains.

1253
01:38:40,897 --> 01:38:41,605
Ah.

1254
01:38:41,689 --> 01:38:44,316
And when it's tipped this way, I shall
have a view through the glass ceiling.

1255
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,193
- What's above-a the ceiling?
- The ballroom.

1256
01:38:48,404 --> 01:38:50,906
Then in my summer palace
I have a barbershop.

1257
01:38:52,742 --> 01:38:55,035
- Is that so?
- Mm-hmm.

1258
01:38:55,119 --> 01:38:56,536
Yes.

1259
01:38:56,621 --> 01:38:58,664
That also has glass walls.

1260
01:38:58,748 --> 01:39:00,249
You don't tell me.

1261
01:39:00,333 --> 01:39:03,585
Oh, yes.
With goldfish swimming inside.

1262
01:39:03,670 --> 01:39:05,587
Wait a minute.
Goldfish swimming inside-a the walls?

1263
01:39:05,672 --> 01:39:07,339
- Mm-hmm.
- How do you feed 'em?

1264
01:39:07,423 --> 01:39:10,926
You can't. They're all dead.
That's why I'm building a new barbershop.

1265
01:39:11,010 --> 01:39:12,052
Oh.

1266
01:39:13,846 --> 01:39:16,431
- Very interesting. Very interesting.
- Yes? Do you like it?

1267
01:39:21,437 --> 01:39:23,021
<i>This is the Hynkel Stadium.</i>

1268
01:39:23,106 --> 01:39:24,479
<i>Before a half
million spectators,</i>

1269
01:39:24,504 --> 01:39:26,966
<i>the greatest display of arms
the world has ever known...</i>

1270
01:39:27,026 --> 01:39:29,027
<i>marches by in review.</i>

1271
01:39:29,112 --> 01:39:31,113
<i>Our beloved Phooey
and II Dig-a-Ditchy are seated...</i>

1272
01:39:31,197 --> 01:39:34,408
<i>in the reviewing stand,
thrilled by this historic event.</i>

1273
01:39:35,410 --> 01:39:36,410
What?

1274
01:39:36,494 --> 01:39:38,120
Nothing. I'm just chewing.

1275
01:39:39,956 --> 01:39:41,873
- Ah, yes.
- Would you care for some peanuts?

1276
01:39:42,959 --> 01:39:46,295
- Thank you. I've had some.
- Oh. Good shape. Here you are, Spook.

1277
01:39:46,379 --> 01:39:48,630
<i>Now passing -
Tomainia's heavy artillery.</i>

1278
01:39:50,466 --> 01:39:51,967
It's all right.

1279
01:39:52,051 --> 01:39:53,676
I want to show you
my new bombing planes.

1280
01:39:53,701 --> 01:39:55,869
I just called up a half
hour ago to start 'em over.

1281
01:39:55,929 --> 01:39:57,555
- Where are they coming from?
- Aroma.

1282
01:39:57,639 --> 01:39:59,307
Aroma? That's 400 miles away.

1283
01:39:59,391 --> 01:40:02,018
That's right. They should be here now.
I don't know what's detaining them.

1284
01:40:02,102 --> 01:40:04,854
<i>Now passing -
Tomainia's light artillery.</i>

1285
01:40:09,651 --> 01:40:11,652
Hmm. That's very light.

1286
01:40:11,737 --> 01:40:13,571
<i>And here come the armored tanks...</i>

1287
01:40:13,655 --> 01:40:15,489
<i>the pride of Tomainia's army.</i>

1288
01:40:15,574 --> 01:40:18,909
<i>The latest design,
the last word in modern warfare.</i>

1289
01:40:19,911 --> 01:40:21,996
Wait a minute.
Where's the propellers?

1290
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:24,248
- Propellers?
- Sure. For going under the water.

1291
01:40:24,333 --> 01:40:26,334
- Tanks that go under the water?
- Submarine work!

1292
01:40:26,418 --> 01:40:27,910
You never heard of aero-marine tanks

1293
01:40:27,935 --> 01:40:30,111
that go under the water
and then fly up-a-stairs?

1294
01:40:30,172 --> 01:40:30,923
What's that?

1295
01:40:30,948 --> 01:40:33,198
Tanks that go under the
water and fly in the air.

1296
01:40:33,258 --> 01:40:35,426
Oh, yes. Those are obsolete now.

1297
01:40:35,510 --> 01:40:37,762
We're concentrating
on flying dreadnoughts.

1298
01:40:37,846 --> 01:40:40,222
Flying dreadnoughts. Mmm.

1299
01:40:45,354 --> 01:40:46,979
- What's that?
- My planes!

1300
01:40:47,064 --> 01:40:50,441
<i>Now passing -
Hynkel's flying division number 34.</i>

1301
01:40:50,525 --> 01:40:52,109
Our planes!

1302
01:40:57,449 --> 01:40:59,825
You're right. They're yours.

1303
01:41:24,976 --> 01:41:26,143
Ah, Garbitsch.

1304
01:41:27,312 --> 01:41:29,230
The invasion of Osterlich.

1305
01:41:29,314 --> 01:41:33,401
It's all so simple. Our troops, tanks
and guns will be hidden along the border.

1306
01:41:33,485 --> 01:41:36,486
To disarm suspicion, you will go hunting -
duck shooting or something.

1307
01:41:36,570 --> 01:41:39,239
At the appointed time, you will show up
at the village of Pretzelberg...

1308
01:41:39,323 --> 01:41:43,159
meet the army, step into an automobile
and cross over into Osterlich.

1309
01:41:43,244 --> 01:41:46,162
Herring and I will be waiting
at the capital to receive you.

1310
01:41:46,247 --> 01:41:48,581
First, Napaloni must remove
his troops from the border.

1311
01:41:48,666 --> 01:41:50,250
That question will be decided tonight.

1312
01:41:50,334 --> 01:41:51,793
Where is Napaloni?

1313
01:41:51,877 --> 01:41:53,962
I'll see if I can find him.
In the meantime...

1314
01:41:54,046 --> 01:41:56,840
it might be advisable for you
to dance with Madam Napaloni.

1315
01:41:56,924 --> 01:41:58,425
Huh?

1316
01:41:58,509 --> 01:41:59,968
It'll carry weight.

1317
01:42:00,052 --> 01:42:01,678
You mean I will carry weight.

1318
01:42:05,724 --> 01:42:07,517
You find him. Let me know at once.

1319
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:16,109
- Madam Napaloni.
- Your Excellency.

1320
01:42:16,193 --> 01:42:18,611
Why so triste?

1321
01:42:18,696 --> 01:42:20,530
'Cause I no speak-a.

1322
01:42:20,614 --> 01:42:22,782
No? May I have the pleasure
of this dance?

1323
01:42:22,867 --> 01:42:24,159
Oh, yes.

1324
01:42:24,243 --> 01:42:25,743
Allow me.

1325
01:42:56,567 --> 01:42:59,819
Madam, your dancing was superb.

1326
01:42:59,904 --> 01:43:01,196
Excellent.

1327
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:02,780
Very good.

1328
01:43:02,865 --> 01:43:04,115
Good.

1329
01:43:17,170 --> 01:43:18,921
- Ah, my dear Adenoid!
- Benzine!

1330
01:43:19,005 --> 01:43:21,757
I've been-a looking for you all evening.
What do you say we have a sandwich...

1331
01:43:21,841 --> 01:43:25,219
go to some quiet little place where we can
sit down and talk-a things over, huh?

1332
01:43:25,303 --> 01:43:26,168
As you wish.

1333
01:43:26,193 --> 01:43:28,788
An excellent idea!
Gentlemen, to the buffet.

1334
01:43:28,848 --> 01:43:30,516
Of course. This way.

1335
01:43:41,236 --> 01:43:42,736
Oh!

1336
01:43:48,952 --> 01:43:50,619
- There's an old Tomainian proverb.
- Mmm?

1337
01:43:55,542 --> 01:43:58,794
That's very funny! I wish I understand it.

1338
01:43:58,878 --> 01:44:00,420
Now, about the border situation.

1339
01:44:00,505 --> 01:44:02,714
- Ah, yes, yes. No problem.
- Oh, it should be no trouble at all.

1340
01:44:02,799 --> 01:44:03,966
- Shh, shh.
- Not at all.

1341
01:44:04,050 --> 01:44:05,217
- What's the matter?
- Wait.

1342
01:44:05,301 --> 01:44:07,302
Out!

1343
01:44:09,806 --> 01:44:11,890
You two, out!

1344
01:44:16,271 --> 01:44:17,271
Out.

1345
01:44:20,149 --> 01:44:22,568
- Out?
- Out.

1346
01:44:22,652 --> 01:44:23,986
- Out?
- Mm-hmm.

1347
01:44:24,988 --> 01:44:26,154
Out.

1348
01:44:28,741 --> 01:44:31,660
As I was saying, about the border question.

1349
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:32,688
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

1350
01:44:32,713 --> 01:44:35,229
Just a matter of detail.
Mere formalities.

1351
01:44:35,290 --> 01:44:36,373
Strawberries.

1352
01:44:36,457 --> 01:44:38,125
Pardon me.
Have you English mustard?

1353
01:44:38,209 --> 01:44:40,252
- English mustard, Your Excellency.
- That's the hot-a stuff?

1354
01:44:40,336 --> 01:44:41,795
- Very hot.
- Ah, good shape, good shape.

1355
01:44:41,879 --> 01:44:43,714
- Cream.
- Cream, Your Excellency.

1356
01:44:43,798 --> 01:44:47,009
Now, Hynkie, as far as I'm concerned,
I'm gonna make this very simple.

1357
01:44:47,093 --> 01:44:50,012
This is the treaty -
You agree not to invade Osterlich...

1358
01:44:50,096 --> 01:44:51,722
I agree not to invade Osterlich.

1359
01:44:51,806 --> 01:44:54,600
We sign-a the treaty,
then I remove-a my troops from the border.

1360
01:44:54,684 --> 01:44:56,852
Good. In other words, when your troops
are off the border, I sign.

1361
01:44:56,936 --> 01:44:58,102
- That's-a right.
- Very good.

1362
01:44:58,186 --> 01:45:01,689
Oh, just a minute.
You don't understand.

1363
01:45:01,773 --> 01:45:04,859
First we sign-a the treaty,
then I remove-a the troops.

1364
01:45:04,943 --> 01:45:07,028
Precisely. I sign when your troops
are off the border.

1365
01:45:07,112 --> 01:45:09,947
Just a minute.
Hey, Spook, treaty.

1366
01:45:10,782 --> 01:45:12,074
Hold-a this.

1367
01:45:12,159 --> 01:45:13,618
Now, look.

1368
01:45:13,702 --> 01:45:15,870
You a-sign this-a treaty a-first...

1369
01:45:15,954 --> 01:45:18,331
then I remove-a the troops after.

1370
01:45:18,415 --> 01:45:19,606
Well, what are
we arguing about?

1371
01:45:19,631 --> 01:45:21,399
You just said I remove-a
the troops a-first.

1372
01:45:21,460 --> 01:45:23,878
You don't expect me to sign
while your troops are there on the border?

1373
01:45:23,962 --> 01:45:26,088
You don't expect me to remove-a
the troops until you sign?

1374
01:45:26,173 --> 01:45:27,214
- Why not?
- Why should I?

1375
01:45:27,299 --> 01:45:28,737
Why shouldn't you?
Osterlich is a free country.

1376
01:45:28,762 --> 01:45:29,240
So?

1377
01:45:29,301 --> 01:45:31,469
Your soldiers are there,
on the Osterlich border!

1378
01:45:31,553 --> 01:45:33,929
And they'll stay there
until you sign this-a treaty!

1379
01:45:34,014 --> 01:45:35,734
You'll take them off,
or I'll blow them off!

1380
01:45:35,759 --> 01:45:36,331
Mmm!

1381
01:45:36,391 --> 01:45:38,225
Gentlemen, this won't get us anywhere.

1382
01:45:38,310 --> 01:45:40,561
Your Excellency, to quote
an old Latin phrase -

1383
01:45:42,356 --> 01:45:44,065
He's a-right! Speak-a to him!

1384
01:45:44,149 --> 01:45:45,149
Strawberries.

1385
01:45:45,233 --> 01:45:47,485
Where's my-a sandwich?
Well, give me another one!

1386
01:45:47,569 --> 01:45:49,820
- Can't we sit down and discuss this -
- I'm a guest-a here.

1387
01:45:49,905 --> 01:45:52,073
Nobody talk to me in my own-a joint
like that!

1388
01:45:52,157 --> 01:45:54,533
Can't we sit down and discuss this thing
without passion?

1389
01:45:54,618 --> 01:45:56,994
I am not-a passionate.
I am-a just, that's all.

1390
01:45:57,079 --> 01:45:59,580
I want him to sign-a the treaty.
I'll remove the troops.

1391
01:45:59,665 --> 01:46:02,124
Can't you understand?
What would my people think...

1392
01:46:02,209 --> 01:46:05,670
signing such a treaty when your soldiers
are there on the Osterlich border?

1393
01:46:05,754 --> 01:46:07,797
I will not-a move a-soldiers
until you-a sign!

1394
01:46:07,881 --> 01:46:10,758
Not until you clear that border
will I sign anything.

1395
01:46:10,842 --> 01:46:13,177
- Then my soldiers remain!
- Then I kick them off!

1396
01:46:13,261 --> 01:46:14,442
One move-a from you, Hynkie,

1397
01:46:14,467 --> 01:46:17,122
and my artillery take-a like
this and blow you to pieces!

1398
01:46:17,182 --> 01:46:20,893
Yes, and my aeroplanes will bomb
your artillery like that!

1399
01:46:20,977 --> 01:46:23,020
You want to start a world-a war?
I'll get you one!

1400
01:46:23,105 --> 01:46:25,356
You and the world!
I'll throw in the ocean!

1401
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:26,774
- Mmm!
- Gentlemen, please!

1402
01:46:38,786 --> 01:46:43,331
I'm-a coming home!
I cannot talk to this ignoramus!

1403
01:46:43,416 --> 01:46:44,374
Strawberries!

1404
01:46:44,458 --> 01:46:46,793
Your Excellency,
we have a very important position...

1405
01:46:46,877 --> 01:46:48,628
that I must urge upon you.

1406
01:46:48,713 --> 01:46:51,131
I know what you must -

1407
01:46:54,385 --> 01:46:58,179
If you would -

1408
01:47:06,564 --> 01:47:08,398
What's wrong?

1409
01:47:08,482 --> 01:47:10,984
I don't give a hoopy!
I got-a my guns here in the pass!

1410
01:47:11,068 --> 01:47:13,653
If he start-a something,
I'll blow him to "passes!"

1411
01:47:17,742 --> 01:47:20,410
Excellency, what's the matter?
What ails you? What has -

1412
01:47:20,494 --> 01:47:23,580
- Your Excellency, this isn't like you.
- Hey! What is the matter?

1413
01:47:23,664 --> 01:47:25,415
Hey, Garbitsch, come here!

1414
01:47:25,499 --> 01:47:27,167
What is the matter with-a Hynkie?

1415
01:47:27,251 --> 01:47:28,918
He's put mustard on his strawberries.

1416
01:47:29,003 --> 01:47:31,921
Mustard -
What else-a can you expect from Hynkie?

1417
01:47:36,177 --> 01:47:37,594
II Dig-a-Ditchy!

1418
01:47:37,678 --> 01:47:39,429
What? What's the matter? What?

1419
01:47:39,513 --> 01:47:42,724
My little bambino!

1420
01:47:56,113 --> 01:47:57,864
- ...the Bacterian -
- ...Tomainia -

1421
01:47:59,784 --> 01:48:02,202
You cannot treat-a
the Bacterian people this way!

1422
01:48:02,286 --> 01:48:05,872
I'll take the Bacterian people
and I'll tear them apart like this!

1423
01:48:05,956 --> 01:48:08,166
- Excellency, please!
- Look! Look what he's-a doing!

1424
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:11,878
It's an insult to my people!

1425
01:48:11,962 --> 01:48:14,506
Look, he's-a pulling spaghetti!
The spaghetti!

1426
01:48:14,590 --> 01:48:16,841
He either sign-a the treaty,
or we have a war!

1427
01:48:16,926 --> 01:48:18,426
- Ooh!
- Listen! Listen!

1428
01:48:18,511 --> 01:48:21,678
Give me a-something! Quick!
Give me a-something! I want to -

1429
01:48:25,391 --> 01:48:27,184
But it's all right. I
have an appointment.

1430
01:48:27,209 --> 01:48:27,917
What's this?

1431
01:48:27,977 --> 01:48:30,521
I'm from the international press.
How's the conference progressing?

1432
01:48:30,605 --> 01:48:33,398
Very successfully. How did you get in?
Excuse me, will you?

1433
01:48:34,651 --> 01:48:36,819
How did this man get in here?

1434
01:48:36,903 --> 01:48:39,106
You know the regulations of the
palace in regard to reporters.

1435
01:48:39,131 --> 01:48:40,179
Go down to Captain Block.

1436
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:42,825
Tell him not to allow anyone else to enter
the palace under any circumstances tonight.

1437
01:48:42,909 --> 01:48:44,952
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

1438
01:48:48,164 --> 01:48:51,667
Of course, there are minor details
to be cleaned up, things that you must -

1439
01:48:52,919 --> 01:48:54,586
Excuse me. We're very busy.

1440
01:48:59,342 --> 01:49:01,468
- Oh!
- Gentlemen, please!

1441
01:49:01,553 --> 01:49:03,971
The press are outside. The whole world
will know that we're fighting.

1442
01:49:04,055 --> 01:49:06,598
- So what?
- Can't we come to some agreement?

1443
01:49:06,683 --> 01:49:09,101
- Not until he-a signs!
- I sign nothing!

1444
01:49:09,185 --> 01:49:11,270
Your Excellency,
I must speak to you alone.

1445
01:49:11,354 --> 01:49:13,105
- Do you mind?
- Mind? I don't a-mind!

1446
01:49:13,189 --> 01:49:15,440
- What is it?
- Sign. Sign.

1447
01:49:15,525 --> 01:49:17,067
Why should he have the advantage?

1448
01:49:17,151 --> 01:49:19,152
What does it matter,
a mere scrap of paper?

1449
01:49:19,237 --> 01:49:21,154
The moment you sign,
he'll take his troops off the border.

1450
01:49:21,239 --> 01:49:23,282
We can move in without losing a man.

1451
01:49:24,701 --> 01:49:26,034
I'll sign.

1452
01:49:26,119 --> 01:49:28,203
What?
Hold-a this!

1453
01:49:28,288 --> 01:49:30,539
Ah, my little Hynkie!

1454
01:49:30,623 --> 01:49:34,209
My-a dictator brother!
I knew we have-a no trouble!

1455
01:49:39,966 --> 01:49:41,776
Two prisoners escaped
in officers' uniforms!

1456
01:49:41,801 --> 01:49:43,409
Officers tied up in the guard room!

1457
01:49:44,137 --> 01:49:46,471
Sound the alarm!
Two prisoners escaped! Come on!

1458
01:50:04,990 --> 01:50:06,824
The planes are searching for us.

1459
01:50:06,909 --> 01:50:08,242
Let's make for the woods.

1460
01:50:08,327 --> 01:50:10,995
No. We must keep in the open.
The border's that way.

1461
01:50:12,748 --> 01:50:14,832
The invasion of Osterlich.

1462
01:50:16,084 --> 01:50:18,669
Now... or never.

1463
01:50:24,468 --> 01:50:25,801
Ducks!

1464
01:50:30,766 --> 01:50:32,516
Did you hear that?

1465
01:50:32,601 --> 01:50:34,727
Came from over there. Come on.

1466
01:50:45,697 --> 01:50:47,073
<i>Da Blitzen!</i>

1467
01:50:50,077 --> 01:50:51,577
Cheese and crackers!

1468
01:50:54,247 --> 01:50:55,748
<i>...da Blitzen!</i>

1469
01:50:56,625 --> 01:50:59,418
A yodeler, huh?
Where'd you get that outfit?

1470
01:50:59,503 --> 01:51:01,212
- What?
- Don't answer back!

1471
01:51:03,674 --> 01:51:06,717
Where's your partner? Where's Schultz?
You won't talk, huh?

1472
01:51:06,802 --> 01:51:09,637
- He'll talk when he gets into camp!
- Come on!

1473
01:51:11,807 --> 01:51:15,393
There it is -
the village of Pretzelberg.

1474
01:51:15,477 --> 01:51:17,144
Pretzelberg.

1475
01:51:17,229 --> 01:51:20,064
If we can pass through there,
we're safe across the Osterlich border.

1476
01:51:20,148 --> 01:51:22,066
- Couldn't we go through the woods?
- Of course not.

1477
01:51:22,150 --> 01:51:24,819
The woods are swarming with soldiers.
They'd suspect us at once.

1478
01:51:24,903 --> 01:51:28,447
We must face the music. If you see
anyone, don't look right or left.

1479
01:51:28,532 --> 01:51:31,242
We must bluff our way through.
Remember, you're a storm trooper.

1480
01:51:32,077 --> 01:51:33,577
Here they come.

1481
01:51:42,253 --> 01:51:44,045
Can you see what they're doing?

1482
01:51:47,174 --> 01:51:49,718
- They're looking this way.
- Well, pay no attention. Keep going.

1483
01:51:52,847 --> 01:51:55,765
They're beginning to follow us.
Shall we run?

1484
01:51:55,850 --> 01:51:57,350
Certainly not.

1485
01:51:57,435 --> 01:51:59,602
- Just a little bit?
- Keep walking.

1486
01:52:01,939 --> 01:52:04,691
We could walk a little faster.

1487
01:52:04,775 --> 01:52:07,110
Hmm? Make up your mind.

1488
01:52:18,205 --> 01:52:20,457
- Perhaps we'd better slow down.
- No, no. Keep going.

1489
01:52:20,541 --> 01:52:22,208
- There's no hurry.
- Come on.

1490
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:27,047
- What is it?
- He's here!

1491
01:52:27,131 --> 01:52:29,716
What? Bugler! Sound assembly!

1492
01:52:39,477 --> 01:52:42,645
Company! Attention!

1493
01:52:43,731 --> 01:52:46,232
Present... arms!

1494
01:52:49,904 --> 01:52:51,861
You don't want to change
your mind and turn back?

1495
01:52:51,886 --> 01:52:53,138
No, keep going. Keep going.

1496
01:52:54,492 --> 01:52:56,993
- Hail Hynkel.
- Order... arms!

1497
01:52:58,829 --> 01:53:01,664
Your Excellency will be pleased to know
that everything is under control.

1498
01:53:01,749 --> 01:53:03,416
- Good.
- Good.

1499
01:53:03,501 --> 01:53:06,920
I have been in continued communication
with Marshal Herring in Osterlich, sir.

1500
01:53:07,004 --> 01:53:09,005
The route ahead of us is well-guarded.

1501
01:53:09,090 --> 01:53:12,759
And at the back of us are 200 tanks,
50 armored cars and 500 machine guns.

1502
01:53:12,843 --> 01:53:14,677
- Is that -
- Good.

1503
01:53:14,762 --> 01:53:17,180
- Good.
- Are we ready to start?

1504
01:53:17,264 --> 01:53:18,515
- Yes.
- Yes.

1505
01:53:19,767 --> 01:53:21,142
Gentlemen.

1506
01:53:27,690 --> 01:53:30,359
Schultz, I'm certainly happy
to see you with us again.

1507
01:53:30,443 --> 01:53:31,777
Thank you.

1508
01:53:38,868 --> 01:53:41,995
- Where are we going?
- You're invading Osterlich.

1509
01:54:55,278 --> 01:54:58,113
Mr. Jaeckel! Mr. Jaeckel!

1510
01:54:58,198 --> 01:55:01,283
- Hannah!
- Mr. Jaeckel, look, they're coming!

1511
01:55:45,786 --> 01:55:47,662
Present... arms!

1512
01:55:49,081 --> 01:55:51,082
Hail Hynkel!

1513
01:55:51,166 --> 01:55:53,417
Hail Hynkel!

1514
01:55:53,502 --> 01:55:55,711
Present... arms!

1515
01:55:57,422 --> 01:56:00,758
Your Excellency,
the world awaits your word.

1516
01:56:33,667 --> 01:56:35,710
What's happened to him?
He looks strange.

1517
01:56:35,794 --> 01:56:37,670
And what's Schultz doing here?

1518
01:56:37,754 --> 01:56:39,088
Pardoned, I suppose.

1519
01:56:51,309 --> 01:57:04,237
Here.

1520
01:57:06,365 --> 01:57:08,658
His Excellency, Herr Garbitsch...

1521
01:57:08,743 --> 01:57:12,120
Secretary of the Interior,
Minister of Propaganda.

1522
01:57:16,959 --> 01:57:19,002
<i>"Corona veniet delectis."</i>

1523
01:57:19,086 --> 01:57:21,296
"Victory shall come to the worthy."

1524
01:57:22,173 --> 01:57:27,385
Today, democracy, liberty and equality
are words to fool the people.

1525
01:57:27,470 --> 01:57:30,180
No nation can progress
with such ideas.

1526
01:57:30,264 --> 01:57:31,848
They stand in the way of action.

1527
01:57:31,932 --> 01:57:33,850
Therefore, we frankly abolish them.

1528
01:57:34,852 --> 01:57:36,020
In the future,

1529
01:57:36,045 --> 01:57:39,547
each man will serve the interest of
the state with absolute obedience.

1530
01:57:39,607 --> 01:57:41,649
Let him who refuses beware.

1531
01:57:41,734 --> 01:57:46,112
The rights of citizenship will be taken
away from all Jews and other non-Aryans.

1532
01:57:46,197 --> 01:57:49,532
They are inferior,
and therefore enemies of the state.

1533
01:57:49,617 --> 01:57:53,036
It is the duty of all true Aryans
to hate and despise them.

1534
01:57:54,246 --> 01:57:57,290
Henceforth, this nation is annexed
to the Tomainian Empire...

1535
01:57:57,375 --> 01:57:58,558
and the people of this nation

1536
01:57:58,583 --> 01:58:01,193
will obey the laws bestowed
upon us by our great leader...

1537
01:58:02,546 --> 01:58:06,716
the dictator of Tomainia,
the conqueror of Osterlich...

1538
01:58:06,801 --> 01:58:10,678
the future emperor of the world.

1539
01:58:11,722 --> 01:58:13,431
You must speak.

1540
01:58:14,433 --> 01:58:15,892
I can't.

1541
01:58:15,976 --> 01:58:18,561
You must. It's our only hope.

1542
01:58:21,357 --> 01:58:22,690
Hope.

1543
01:59:10,530 --> 01:59:12,114
I'm sorry...

1544
01:59:12,198 --> 01:59:14,116
but I don't want to be an emperor.

1545
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:16,285
That's not my business.

1546
01:59:16,369 --> 01:59:18,871
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.

1547
01:59:18,955 --> 01:59:20,873
I should like to help everyone,
if possible -

1548
01:59:20,957 --> 01:59:24,209
Jew, gentile, black man, white.

1549
01:59:24,294 --> 01:59:27,880
We all want to help one another.
Human beings are like that.

1550
01:59:27,964 --> 01:59:31,216
We want to live by each other's happiness,
not by each other's misery.

1551
01:59:31,301 --> 01:59:33,719
We don't want to hate and despise
one another.

1552
01:59:33,803 --> 01:59:36,972
In this world, there's room for everyone,
and the good earth is rich...

1553
01:59:37,056 --> 01:59:38,974
and can provide for everyone.

1554
01:59:39,058 --> 01:59:42,102
The way of life can be free and beautiful.

1555
01:59:42,187 --> 01:59:44,229
But we have lost the way.

1556
01:59:44,314 --> 01:59:46,857
Greed has poisoned men's souls...

1557
01:59:46,941 --> 01:59:49,234
has barricaded the world with hate...

1558
01:59:49,319 --> 01:59:52,237
has goose-stepped us
into misery and bloodshed.

1559
01:59:52,322 --> 01:59:55,699
We have developed speed,
but we have shut ourselves in.

1560
01:59:55,783 --> 01:59:58,827
Machinery that gives abundance
has left us in want.

1561
01:59:58,912 --> 02:00:02,831
Our knowledge has made us cynical,
our cleverness hard and unkind.

1562
02:00:02,916 --> 02:00:05,751
We think too much and feel too little.

1563
02:00:05,835 --> 02:00:08,419
More than machinery,
we need humanity.

1564
02:00:08,504 --> 02:00:12,089
More than cleverness,
we need kindness and gentleness.

1565
02:00:12,174 --> 02:00:16,427
Without these qualities, life will
be violent, and all will be lost.

1566
02:00:16,512 --> 02:00:19,222
The aeroplane and the radio
have brought us closer together.

1567
02:00:19,306 --> 02:00:22,517
These very nature of these inventions
cries out for the goodness in men...

1568
02:00:22,601 --> 02:00:26,020
cries out for universal brotherhood,
for the unity of us all.

1569
02:00:26,104 --> 02:00:29,106
Even now, my voice is reaching
millions throughout the world...

1570
02:00:29,191 --> 02:00:32,401
millions of despairing men,
women and little children...

1571
02:00:32,486 --> 02:00:37,490
victims of a system that makes men torture
and imprison innocent people.

1572
02:00:37,574 --> 02:00:40,952
To those who can hear me I say,
do not despair.

1573
02:00:41,036 --> 02:00:44,205
The misery that is now upon us
is but the passing of greed...

1574
02:00:44,289 --> 02:00:48,042
the bitterness of men who fear
the way of human progress.

1575
02:00:48,126 --> 02:00:51,420
The hate of men will pass,
and dictators die...

1576
02:00:51,505 --> 02:00:55,049
and the power they took from the people
will return to the people.

1577
02:00:55,133 --> 02:00:58,928
And so long as men die,
liberty will never perish.

1578
02:01:00,305 --> 02:01:02,974
Soldiers,
don't give yourselves to brutes...

1579
02:01:03,058 --> 02:01:06,727
men who despise you, enslave you,
who regiment your lives...

1580
02:01:06,812 --> 02:01:09,063
tell you what to do,
what to think and what to feel...

1581
02:01:09,147 --> 02:01:13,484
who drill you, diet you, treat you
like cattle, use you as cannon fodder!

1582
02:01:13,569 --> 02:01:16,153
Don't give yourselves
to these unnatural men -

1583
02:01:16,238 --> 02:01:19,824
machine men with machine minds
and machine hearts!

1584
02:01:19,908 --> 02:01:23,661
You are not machines!
You are not cattle! You are men!

1585
02:01:23,745 --> 02:01:25,997
You have the love of humanity
in your hearts.

1586
02:01:26,081 --> 02:01:28,416
You don't hate.
Only the unloved hate.

1587
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:30,418
The unloved and the unnatural.

1588
02:01:30,502 --> 02:01:34,005
Soldiers, don't fight for slavery,
fight for liberty!

1589
02:01:34,089 --> 02:01:36,132
In the 17th chapter of Saint Luke
it is written...

1590
02:01:36,216 --> 02:01:37,842
"The kingdom of God is within man."

1591
02:01:37,926 --> 02:01:41,512
Not one man nor a group of men,
but in all men - in you!

1592
02:01:41,597 --> 02:01:43,639
You the people have the power -

1593
02:01:43,724 --> 02:01:46,726
the power to create machines,
the power to create happiness!

1594
02:01:46,810 --> 02:01:50,353
You the people have the power
to make this life free and beautiful...

1595
02:01:50,438 --> 02:01:52,689
to make this life a wonderful adventure.

1596
02:01:52,773 --> 02:01:55,942
Then, in the name of democracy,
let us use that power!

1597
02:01:56,027 --> 02:01:57,611
Let us all unite!

1598
02:01:57,695 --> 02:02:01,114
Let us fight for a new world,
a decent world...

1599
02:02:01,198 --> 02:02:02,949
that will give men a chance to work...

1600
02:02:03,034 --> 02:02:06,036
that will give youth a future
and old age a security.

1601
02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:09,080
By the promise of these things,
brutes have risen to power.

1602
02:02:09,165 --> 02:02:13,043
But they lie. They do not fulfill
that promise. They never will!

1603
02:02:13,127 --> 02:02:16,880
Dictators free themselves,
but they enslave the people.

1604
02:02:16,964 --> 02:02:20,050
Now let us fight to fulfill that promise!

1605
02:02:20,134 --> 02:02:22,385
Let us fight to free the world...

1606
02:02:22,470 --> 02:02:26,056
to do away with national barriers,
to do away with greed...

1607
02:02:26,140 --> 02:02:28,141
with hate and intolerance.

1608
02:02:28,225 --> 02:02:32,812
Let us fight for a world of reason,
a world where science and progress...

1609
02:02:32,897 --> 02:02:35,231
will lead to all men's happiness.

1610
02:02:35,316 --> 02:02:39,653
Soldiers, in the name of democracy,
let us all unite!

1611
02:03:04,762 --> 02:03:06,054
Hannah...

1612
02:03:07,014 --> 02:03:08,515
can you hear me?

1613
02:03:09,600 --> 02:03:13,186
<i>Wherever you are, look up, Hannah.</i>

1614
02:03:14,021 --> 02:03:16,272
<i>The clouds are lifting.</i>

1615
02:03:16,357 --> 02:03:18,358
<i>The sun is breaking through.</i>

1616
02:03:18,859 --> 02:03:22,362
<i>We are coming out of the darkness
and into the light.</i>

1617
02:03:22,446 --> 02:03:26,783
<i>We are coming into a new world,
a kindlier world...</i>

1618
02:03:26,867 --> 02:03:29,119
<i>where men will rise above their hate...</i>

1619
02:03:29,203 --> 02:03:31,870
<i>their greed and brutality.</i>

1620
02:03:32,872 --> 02:03:34,540
<i>Look up, Hannah.</i>

1621
02:03:34,624 --> 02:03:37,209
<i>The soul of man has been given wings...</i>

1622
02:03:37,293 --> 02:03:40,295
<i>and at last he is beginning to fly.</i>

1623
02:03:40,380 --> 02:03:42,631
<i>He is flying into the rainbow...</i>

1624
02:03:42,716 --> 02:03:46,135
<i>into the light of hope,
into the future -</i>

1625
02:03:46,219 --> 02:03:48,303
<i>the glorious future...</i>

1626
02:03:48,388 --> 02:03:51,306
<i>that belongs to you, to me...</i>

1627
02:03:51,391 --> 02:03:53,225
<i>and to all of us.</i>

1628
02:03:53,309 --> 02:03:56,019
<i>Look up, Hannah. Look up.</i>

1629
02:04:21,171 --> 02:04:24,339
Hannah, did you hear that?

1630
02:04:26,509 --> 02:04:27,843
Listen.
