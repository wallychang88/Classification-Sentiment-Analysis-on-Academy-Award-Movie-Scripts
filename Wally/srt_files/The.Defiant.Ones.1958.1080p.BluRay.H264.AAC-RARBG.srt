Sewin' machine

10
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:04,011
Sewin' machine

11
00:01:05,513 --> 00:01:07,413
Sew so fast

12
00:01:08,614 --> 00:01:10,514
Sew eleven stitches

13
00:01:11,215 --> 00:01:14,415
In a little cat's tail

14
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:19,916
I left my home in Nashville

15
00:01:21,018 --> 00:01:23,618

A-put me in the pen

20
00:01:40,326 --> 00:01:43,426
If I ever see his face once more

21
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:46,726
He never get home again

22
00:01:46,927 --> 00:01:49,327
That judge be long gone

23
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:52,129
To Kentucky

24
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,830
Long gone

25
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,930

A long gone judge on a bowlin' green

00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:04,734
Bowlin' green

00:02:12,637 --> 00:02:15,037

33
00:02:15,738 --> 00:02:20,138
We oughta make him ride up front.
See how much singin' he'll do then.

34
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,840

35
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,841
Shut up, do you hear me ?! Shut up !

36
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:29,042
Long gone

37
00:02:29,343 --> 00:02:31,443
Did you hear what I said ? I said shut up !

38
00:02:31,744 --> 00:02:34,744

00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:36,145
Shut up !

40
00:02:36,345 --> 00:02:39,745

00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:44,647

42
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:49,749

43
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:53,951
You heard what the man

You call me nigger again, Joker,

00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,055
Make your move, ni ...

46
00:03:04,355 --> 00:03:06,255
Look out !

47
00:04:07,178 --> 00:04:09,078
Sheriff Muller speakin'.

48
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:12,279
No, Governor. Nobody dead.

49
00:04:12,981 --> 00:04:15,381
Yes. Sideswiped.

50
00:04:15,582 --> 00:04:17,782
Yes. Only two escaped.

51
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,583
Yes, Governor, I know
what my first obligation is.

52
00:04:21,884 --> 00:04:24,484
We're still waitin' on the dogs.

53
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:27,585
Yes, Governor. Any minute now.

54
00:04:27,786 --> 00:04:30,486
I got a call in to Warden Comisky.

55
00:04:32,088 --> 00:04:35,388
Yes, Governor. I'm quite sure you will.

56
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:43,291
Hello, Max.

57
00:04:43,493 --> 00:04:46,193
- Am I the first ?
- You're the only one I called.

58
00:04:46,493 --> 00:04:48,393
- Anythin' new ?
- Not a thing.

59
00:04:48,594 --> 00:04:52,494
Drivers are still unconscious. The men
don't know anythin', or won't say.

60
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:54,895
- Who was on the phone ?
- The governor.

61
00:04:55,096 --> 00:04:57,696
- Oh ? Anythin' I can print ?
- Sure.

62
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:01,198
He says he's gonna get
to the bottom of this.

63
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:04,399
- That's nice of him.
- It's an election year.

64
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,000
It's election year for you, too, Max.

65
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:13,201
Try Warden Comisky again.
We need that laundry for the dogs.

66
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:18,203
And call Marysville.
See if they located that dog man.

67
00:05:18,505 --> 00:05:20,805
Here you are, Sheriff. Coffee.

68
00:05:21,006 --> 00:05:22,506
Thanks.

69
00:05:26,508 --> 00:05:28,908
Let's go, boys, let's go. Pile it out.

70
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:33,208
That's right, pile it out, will you, boys ?
We have no time to lose.

71
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,310
Now what the devil ... ?

72
00:05:39,112 --> 00:05:40,412
Here we are, Max.

73
00:05:40,613 --> 00:05:42,613
- Who sent for you ?
- I called 'em.

74
00:05:42,813 --> 00:05:45,113
- What am I gonna do with 'em ?
- Deputise 'em.

75
00:05:45,314 --> 00:05:48,314
We can't work short-handed.
I only have six men.

76
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:51,316
Will you turn that radio off, please ?

77
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,717
If the roadblocks don't pick them up,

78
00:05:53,818 --> 00:05:57,718
we may have to fine-comb a lot
of ground before we flush 'em.

79
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:01,419
Well, watch how you play with
those guns. They're not toys.

80
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:07,421
Are you kiddin', Max, after all the huntin'
we've done ? It's just like runnin' rabbits.

81
00:06:07,822 --> 00:06:10,422
- These are men.
- Same thing.

82
00:06:11,324 --> 00:06:12,624
Sure.

83
00:06:12,825 --> 00:06:15,325
Men and rabbits ... same thing.

84
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:17,925
It's not the same thing !

85
00:06:19,327 --> 00:06:22,427
Well, we just want to give you
a hand, Max. Help out.

86
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:26,128
- You wanna be helpful, Lou ?
- Sure, Max.

87
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:28,529
Good. Get rid of this.

88
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:34,231
All right, boys. Chow down the line.
Let's eat it up. Off we go.

89
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:41,533
Quit bein' stubborn. They really want
to help, and they can come in handy.

90
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,235
- I guess so.
- All right.

91
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:47,136
What about the two men who escaped ?

92
00:06:47,437 --> 00:06:50,037
- Sheriff, I got the warden on the phone.
- Fine.

93
00:06:50,338 --> 00:06:55,038
Get the captain to show you the records.
Get everythin' you want from them.

94
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:15,947
Noah Cullen. Negro.

95
00:07:16,148 --> 00:07:19,348
Assault and battery. Intent to kill. 10 to 20.

96
00:07:19,549 --> 00:07:22,749
Parole refused. Solitary. Work camp.

97
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,150
John Jackson. Caucasian.
Armed robbery ...

98
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:28,951
- Caucasian ?
- Caucasian.

99
00:07:29,152 --> 00:07:33,752
Five to 10. Attacked guard.
Additional five. Parole refused.

100
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:38,155
Hey, Max. How come they chained
a white man to a black ?

101
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:40,956
The warden's got a sense of humour.

102
00:07:41,858 --> 00:07:44,258
What'd he say just now ?

103
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:47,758
He said not to worry about catching 'em.

104
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:51,159
They'll probably kill each other
before they go five miles.

105
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,380
Hey ! Max ! Stop aggravatin' those dogs !

106
00:08:50,381 --> 00:08:52,181
What's he so excited about ?

107
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:55,683
You shouldn't be eatin' in front
of the dogs ! That isn't very nice !

108
00:08:55,984 --> 00:08:58,084
They've got feelings too, you know.

109
00:08:58,284 --> 00:08:59,684
Shut up in there ! Shut up !

110
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:02,486
Solly, we're not hurtin' their feelings.

111
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:06,987
I'm sorry, Sheriff, I shouldn't have yelled.
But my dogs are high-strung.

112
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:09,188
Now will you please ...

113
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:11,289
What are those ?

114
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,290
These beauties in here ?
These are Dobermans.

115
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:17,391
- You don't know nothin' about dogs.
- Not that kind.

116
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:21,392
Well now, my bloodhounds here
won't even touch a hamburger.

117
00:09:21,593 --> 00:09:24,593
But these beauties ... when my
bloodhounds track 'em down,

118
00:09:24,994 --> 00:09:28,794
- these'll take care of them, all right.
- We ain't gonna need 'em.

119
00:09:28,997 --> 00:09:32,397
We're dealin' with a couple of
dangerous criminals, Sheriff.

120
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:36,397
How dangerous can they be,
chained together ?

121
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:38,599
Look, Muller, come here.

122
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,100
You're new to this kind of operation.

123
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:45,701
If your views are humanitarian, you think
about the farmers and your own deputies.

124
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,902
Let me do my own thinkin', Captain.

125
00:09:48,102 --> 00:09:53,402
It's your show, Sheriff, but I say the dogs
go along. I've got my own men to think of.

126
00:09:54,806 --> 00:09:57,106
All right, but kept on a leash.

127
00:09:57,307 --> 00:10:03,107
Solly ? You keep those dogs on a leash.
Don't let 'em go unless I tell ya.

128
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,710
Solly, you'll find the old clothes
in the back of the squad car.

129
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:14,711
I'll have to make a big circle. Your men
been trampin' all around this here place.

130
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:18,213
Helmick ! Get everybody up to the Jeep !

131
00:10:20,615 --> 00:10:23,615
I'm gonna buy me a pair
of buckskin shoes,

132
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:26,117
with a brand-new suit and a silk shirt.

133
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:29,718
And I'll be Charlie Potatoes,
comin' down the street,

134
00:10:29,918 --> 00:10:32,618
with a Panama hat and a good-lookin' gal.

135
00:10:33,219 --> 00:10:37,119
Come on, boy, you got a free arm.
Come on, boy, hit it. Come on, boy, hit it !

136
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:40,321
- Boy, eh ?
- Hit it ! Hit it !

137
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:42,922
No more "Yassuh, boss."

138
00:10:43,724 --> 00:10:47,724
- I'll go to Rio and never be found.
- No more "Yassuh, boss" !

139
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:52,024
- I'll never be found !
- No more "Yassuh, boss" !

140
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:01,629
It won't break.

141
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,531
Need a chisel and a hammer.

142
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:12,933
- Come on, let's go.
- Go where ?

143
00:11:13,234 --> 00:11:16,634
- Pineville.
- Pineville's south. I don't go south.

144
00:11:16,835 --> 00:11:19,335
I knew a girl in Pineville.
We'll get this broke.

145
00:11:19,636 --> 00:11:22,636
Then what ? A strange coloured man
in a white South town.

146
00:11:22,837 --> 00:11:24,637
How long before they pick me up ?

147
00:11:24,838 --> 00:11:27,938
Get off my back !
I ain't married to you ! Come on !

148
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:30,739
You married to me all right,
and here's the ring.

149
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,440
But I ain't goin' south on no
honeymoon. We goin' north.

150
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:37,942
- Through the swamp ?
- We go around it.

151
00:11:38,643 --> 00:11:41,543
I used to work a turpentine mill
60 miles north of here.

152
00:11:41,845 --> 00:11:45,145
There's a train come to pick up
the turpentine every day.

153
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:50,146
It come out of the swamp and cross
the line to the paint makers in Ohio.

154
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:52,548
Now we try for that train.

155
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:55,649
- How long you been in jail ?
- Eight years.

156
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,649
And the train's still runnin' ?

157
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,450
- I don't know.
- You don't know ?

158
00:12:00,751 --> 00:12:03,651
Askin' me to go 60 miles with you
and you don't even know !

159
00:12:03,952 --> 00:12:07,752
What are you invitin' me on ?
A long walk off a short pier ?

160
00:12:08,154 --> 00:12:10,154
Nothin' doin' ! Now come on !

161
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,355
Come on, damn you !

162
00:12:12,655 --> 00:12:14,155
Come on !

163
00:12:16,758 --> 00:12:19,258
- You're Charlie Potatoes, uh ?
- Yeah.

164
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:22,959
You gonna dance down the street with
a gal on one arm and this on the other ?

165
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:27,059
You gonna grab a boat to Rio,
pullin' your own anchor ?

166
00:12:27,262 --> 00:12:28,862
We can get this broke.

167
00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:32,662
What you gonna do ?
Bite it through with your teeth ?

168
00:12:32,963 --> 00:12:35,363
Maybe your head's hard enough !

169
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,465
The time's gonna come, Joker.
The time's gonna come.

170
00:12:40,865 --> 00:12:44,265
But if you want it to be right here,
right now, that's OK with me.

171
00:12:44,568 --> 00:12:47,768
You got the advantage of me -
tough to see if the light ain't good.

172
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:51,469
But you can hear me, Joker, so listen
good. Either we go north together,

173
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,670
or together we gonna go them 10 miles
right back onto Dead Street !

174
00:13:02,974 --> 00:13:05,574
You're right, boy. You're right.

175
00:13:05,775 --> 00:13:08,875
The time is gonna come.
It's sure gonna come.

176
00:13:09,077 --> 00:13:12,777
All right. Now north is up that way.

177
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:16,579
All right, men, we're ready to move out.

178
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,880
The sheriff is in charge. I'm second in
command. You take your orders from us.

179
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,180
You will deploy into two groups,

180
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:28,081
pivotin' around the headquarters group,
which consists of the sheriff and myself.

181
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,584
You. Douse that radio.

182
00:13:36,587 --> 00:13:38,487
One more thing.

183
00:13:39,188 --> 00:13:42,188
This may take a couple of days.
Maybe more.

184
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,989
So all check your gear.
Your rations. Ponchos.

185
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:49,489
You new deputies,
you check with the troopers.

186
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:51,991
Keep your lines dressed. Don't fall behind.

187
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:53,392
Just one minute.

188
00:13:54,493 --> 00:13:57,493
- Anythin' you'd like to add, Sheriff ?
- Negative.

189
00:13:59,895 --> 00:14:01,895
Deploy.

190
00:14:03,196 --> 00:14:05,196
Let's move out.

191
00:17:04,963 --> 00:17:07,463
I almost ... swallowed half that river.

192
00:17:09,063 --> 00:17:10,163
Thanks.

193
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:14,364
- What for ?
- For pullin' me out.

194
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:18,866
Man, I didn't pull you out.
I kept you from pullin' me in.

195
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:26,369
What is it ?

196
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,770
- You didn't approve of dogs.
- I got nothin' against dogs.

197
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:33,572
They're man's best friend, aren't they ?

198
00:17:35,874 --> 00:17:37,874
What are you lookin' for ? Lipstick ?

199
00:17:38,074 --> 00:17:40,074
All right, Solly, get goin'.

200
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:44,075
Sheriff, I can't run my dogs
any more today. They need a rest.

201
00:17:44,476 --> 00:17:49,376
- We got an hour of daylight left !
- Never mind. Our men need a rest, too.

202
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,179
- OK ?
- OK, Solly.

203
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,180
It was that last waltz that did it.

204
00:17:57,781 --> 00:18:00,481
You're givin' those cons
a pretty good head start.

205
00:18:00,682 --> 00:18:02,782
They have to rest, too, you know.

206
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,984
You don't look so good yourself.

207
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:19,289
Now !

208
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,151
Got him !

209
00:18:39,794 --> 00:18:41,394
Listen to 'em.

210
00:18:41,595 --> 00:18:43,195
What are they ?

211
00:18:43,295 --> 00:18:45,195
Night birds mostly.

212
00:18:45,396 --> 00:18:47,396
Bugs.

213
00:18:47,597 --> 00:18:49,497
I wish they'd shut up.

214
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:52,197
Thanks.

215
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,300
- I keep listenin' for the dogs.
- It's too soon.

216
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,800
How fast do you think they can go ?

217
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:08,301
Ain't no road. They gotta
come on foot, same as us.

218
00:19:11,954 --> 00:19:14,354
- Animals in there ?
- Some.

219
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:16,504
- What kind ?
- All kinds.

220
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:20,105
- Like what ?
- Like gators and ...

221
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:22,606
Wild pig. Black bear.

222
00:19:22,806 --> 00:19:26,206
- How come they don't make any noise ?
- They animals.

223
00:19:27,408 --> 00:19:29,808
They either bein' hunted or ... huntin'.

224
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:33,609
Either way they don't make no noise.

225
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,509
I go with that.

226
00:19:48,713 --> 00:19:50,513
Listen.

227
00:19:50,714 --> 00:19:55,414
Must be a million of 'em. Not one of 'em
understands what the other one is sayin'.

228
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:57,416
They just bugs.

229
00:19:57,616 --> 00:20:00,516
Bugs or people.
Nobody understands anybody.

230
00:20:00,717 --> 00:20:05,117
Them animals, they're smarter.
You keep quiet and you hunt for yourself.

231
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:07,518
I go with that.

232
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:17,321
What was that ?

233
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:19,421
Weasel.

234
00:20:19,723 --> 00:20:21,823
Hoot owl musta got him.

235
00:20:22,024 --> 00:20:24,624
I thought you said they
didn't make any noise.

236
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,224
Only when they're dyin', Joker.

237
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:33,025
That's a great way to live.
You keep quiet all your life,

238
00:20:33,226 --> 00:20:36,826
and the only time you open
your mouth is when you're dyin'.

239
00:20:41,229 --> 00:20:43,029
Thanks.

240
00:20:43,229 --> 00:20:45,529
Why don't you cut it out ?

241
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,930
You keep saying "thanks".
I hate that word "thanks".

242
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:51,431
Don't mean nothin'.

243
00:20:51,631 --> 00:20:55,031
You try makin' a livin'
with that word ... you find out.

244
00:20:56,334 --> 00:20:59,434
I used to park cars in Natchez.

245
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:04,733
A big fancy hotel. A fella'd give me
his car and I'd say "Thank you, sir."

246
00:21:05,035 --> 00:21:07,835
I was doin' him a favour,
but I had to say "Thank you, sir."

247
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:10,936
- The louder I said it, the bigger the tip.
- That figures.

248
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:14,237
You gotta be Charlie Potatoes,
the man with the money.

249
00:21:14,538 --> 00:21:17,038
Then you don't have to
bow down to nobody.

250
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:19,639
That's the way I'm gonna live.

251
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,440
Even when they didn't give me a tip
I still had to say thank you.

252
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,940
That word got like it was stickin'
needles in me every time I said it.

253
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:32,241
That can happen with a word.
You know what I mean, boy ?

254
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:39,543
Yeah. And I got a needle stickin' in me
right now. Joker, don't call me "boy".

255
00:21:43,646 --> 00:21:45,746
You're just too sensitive, man.

256
00:21:45,946 --> 00:21:49,846
- I'm too nothin'.
- That's right. You're too nothin' is right.

257
00:21:50,248 --> 00:21:53,348
But I got a little advice for you, man,
because I like you, man.

258
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:57,349
You gotta take things as they are.
You can't keep fighting 'em.

259
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:00,049
I see you got a lot to learn, boy.

260
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:03,651
Like you livin' in that fancy hotel ?

261
00:22:04,653 --> 00:22:06,853
Yeah. Like me livin' in that fancy hotel.

262
00:22:07,153 --> 00:22:10,853
- You think they'll let me in that hotel ?
- Sure they'll let you in that hotel.

263
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:13,653
Through the back door,
if you got a pail and a mop.

264
00:22:13,955 --> 00:22:18,255
And you through the front door,
just long enough to collect your tip !

265
00:22:18,455 --> 00:22:21,855
What's eatin' you ?
Just because I called you a ni ...

266
00:22:22,157 --> 00:22:23,757
Yeah.

267
00:22:24,057 --> 00:22:27,657
Well, that's what you are, ain't it ?
It's like callin' a spade a spade.

268
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:30,259
I'm a hunky. I don't try to argue out of it.

269
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,860
You can call me a bohunk. I don't mind.

270
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,260
You ever hear tell of a bohunk
in a woodpile, Joker ?

271
00:22:38,661 --> 00:22:42,461
You ever hear tell of
"catch a bohunk by the toe" ?

272
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:45,063
- Depends on how you mean it.
- How'd you mean it ?

273
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,463
Don't crowd me !
I didn't make up no names !

274
00:22:47,664 --> 00:22:52,064
No, you breathe it in when you're born,
and you spit it out from then on.

275
00:22:52,365 --> 00:22:54,765
That name sure bugs you, don't it ?

276
00:22:55,766 --> 00:23:00,666
Well, that's the way it is, and you're stuck
with it, cos I didn't make any rules.

277
00:23:00,967 --> 00:23:04,867
- No, but you sure live by 'em.
- Everybody lives by 'em.

278
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:08,169
- Even them swamp animals.
- Even that weasel.

279
00:23:08,469 --> 00:23:10,469
You callin' me a weasel ?

280
00:23:11,571 --> 00:23:13,971
No, I'm callin' you a white man.

281
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,180
What's the matter ?

282
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,580
Nothin'.

283
00:23:46,681 --> 00:23:49,181
Come on, let's get outta here.

284
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,490
Gee up ! Haaahh !

285
00:24:41,597 --> 00:24:44,397
- Do you think he saw us ?
- I don't know.

286
00:24:44,596 --> 00:24:49,396
- What is this ? Where are we ?
- I think it's some kind of clay pit.

287
00:24:49,699 --> 00:24:51,999
Come on, let's get outta here.

288
00:25:17,507 --> 00:25:20,007
Why don't you ... Let go of the chain !

289
00:25:20,206 --> 00:25:22,306
You tellin' me what to do ?!

290
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:24,407
Come on, let's try it again !

291
00:25:58,817 --> 00:26:01,917
Let me try it ...
Let me try it on your shoulders.

292
00:26:51,933 --> 00:26:55,433
- Give me a little slack !
- I can't !

293
00:26:57,234 --> 00:26:59,634
Don't let go now ! Hold on !

294
00:27:00,235 --> 00:27:01,335
Hold on !

295
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,540
I got it ! I got it !

296
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
Don't slip ! Hold on !

297
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:56,249
- What are you doin' ?
- Lookin' at this hand.

298
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,750
- What for ?
- Looks infected.

299
00:27:58,851 --> 00:28:00,651
What you gonna do about it ?

300
00:28:00,852 --> 00:28:04,352
- It needs fixin'.
- Don't do me any favours.

301
00:28:04,653 --> 00:28:07,153
I ain't doin' you no favours, Joker.

302
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:27,659
That feels nice and cool.

303
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:30,859
It's a poultice.

304
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,660
What do you want me to say ?
Want me to say thanks ?

305
00:28:35,961 --> 00:28:38,761
All right. Thanks. Thanks.
Thanks. Thanks !

306
00:28:45,664 --> 00:28:48,064
That word sure bugs you, don't it ?

307
00:28:48,765 --> 00:28:51,065
Well, I been sayin' it all my life.

308
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:54,566
When I was a kid, I didn't have no shoes.

309
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:59,967
In church I'd sit with the rest of the kids
and I'd say "Thank you, Lord ! Thank you !"

310
00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:03,769
Well, they didn't have
no shoes either, Joker.

311
00:29:03,968 --> 00:29:06,768
All God's children got shoes.

312
00:29:06,969 --> 00:29:08,369
Come on.

313
00:29:33,277 --> 00:29:36,977
Muller speakin'. Kill the roadblocks.
They've headed north.

314
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,680
No, no chance of them circlin' back.
They're already across the McHenry.

315
00:29:41,979 --> 00:29:45,679
The trail is still pretty fresh.
We should have 'em in a day or two.

316
00:29:45,981 --> 00:29:49,481
Max, I've got somethin' I want
to say to you. It's important.

317
00:29:49,782 --> 00:29:51,582
Get down.

318
00:29:51,782 --> 00:29:55,182
Call my wife, will you ?
Tell her everything's OK.

319
00:29:55,384 --> 00:29:57,584
Listen, Max. This is important.

320
00:29:57,785 --> 00:30:00,485
I'm not lettin' my dogs
cross that water out there.

321
00:30:00,786 --> 00:30:01,586
Fine.

322
00:30:01,784 --> 00:30:04,584
I'm lettin' nobody make me ruin my dogs.

323
00:30:04,786 --> 00:30:08,086
I hope you treat your grandmother
the way you treat those dogs.

324
00:30:08,287 --> 00:30:11,387
- Oh, that's funny.
- Wasn't meant to be.

325
00:30:11,689 --> 00:30:18,089
Well, I think more of these here dogs
than I do of any two old stinkin' convicts.

326
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,390
Good. Good.

327
00:30:22,691 --> 00:30:25,291
Max, you don't care if
I use your phone, do you ?

328
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:30,893
Got anythin' ?

329
00:30:31,093 --> 00:30:34,093
Well, the way I got it figured,
we'll ford it here ...

330
00:30:40,497 --> 00:30:43,897
Regroup across the river,
then backtrack and pick up the trail.

331
00:30:44,197 --> 00:30:46,797
- Fine.
- That detour will cost us two hours.

332
00:30:47,098 --> 00:30:49,098
- Can't be helped.
- I think it could.

333
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:51,298
Why don't we call Cumberland ?

334
00:30:51,498 --> 00:30:54,098
For what ? Ask for a tank
and armoured divisions ?

335
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:56,899
They have a 12-hour start,
and we're about to lose two !

336
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,500
- I appreciate the arithmetic.
- Catchin' men is my business.

337
00:31:00,722 --> 00:31:02,822
And makin' the decisions is mine.

338
00:31:13,925 --> 00:31:18,325
It don't look like much.
That the company store ?

339
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:20,527
Yeah.

340
00:31:20,728 --> 00:31:24,728
There's tools in there,
and food too, waitin' for us.

341
00:31:27,129 --> 00:31:32,029
They'll be asleep pretty soon. We better
hunker down before somebody sees us.

342
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:51,234
They sloppin' the hogs.

343
00:31:51,935 --> 00:31:54,235
That means suppertime's over.

344
00:31:57,638 --> 00:32:01,338
I used to feed the hogs
at the prison farm sometimes.

345
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,240
That sure was a nice farm.

346
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,940
Yeah. All that machinery.

347
00:32:13,142 --> 00:32:17,942
You know somethin' ? Fella get himself
a farm, he'd have a pretty sweet setup.

348
00:32:19,244 --> 00:32:23,744
As long as a fella don't have to scratch it
out with hand tools and a mule.

349
00:32:24,545 --> 00:32:27,445
Leastways you always got
somethin' to eat.

350
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:33,448
I worked 36 acres by hand once.

351
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,048
My wife ...

352
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,450
My wife helped me.

353
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:44,150
Sometimes even my little kid.

354
00:32:45,952 --> 00:32:48,452
Man, we never had enough to eat.

355
00:32:50,853 --> 00:32:53,353
I didn't know you was married.

356
00:32:59,754 --> 00:33:02,154
What happened to your kid ?

357
00:33:03,656 --> 00:33:06,056
He was just five years old when I left.

358
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:10,858
He don't even remember me that much.

359
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,559
Everybody winds up alone.
Not just you. Everybody.

360
00:33:19,461 --> 00:33:21,561
That's the way it is.

361
00:33:24,161 --> 00:33:26,261
One down, five to go.

362
00:33:33,764 --> 00:33:36,664
I got an old man around someplace.

363
00:33:36,965 --> 00:33:41,265
The last time I seen him
was the day I got out of the army,

364
00:33:41,566 --> 00:33:45,266
and we spent half my bonus cheque
gettin' lushed up together.

365
00:33:45,468 --> 00:33:47,868
Ahh, I got nothin' against him.

366
00:33:49,368 --> 00:33:51,368
My old man,

367
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,470
he was a Bible-thumper.

368
00:33:56,872 --> 00:34:00,872
- Always tryin' to teach us somethin'.
- What's there to know ?

369
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,772
I used to work in automobiles.
Transmission man.

370
00:34:03,973 --> 00:34:08,973
$1.80 an hour, so some fink in a Cadillac
could drive it without havin' to shift gears.

371
00:34:09,374 --> 00:34:13,374
- That's pretty good pay.
- You know what it meant to me ?

372
00:34:13,776 --> 00:34:17,476
Saturday night in a gin mill,
bein' Charlie Potatoes with a blonde,

373
00:34:17,677 --> 00:34:20,277
or maybe a redhead. Anythin' I wanted.

374
00:34:21,777 --> 00:34:26,277
Then Monday mornin' there I was, back
in that pit with grease in my eyeballs.

375
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:29,979
- Somebody gotta fix them cars.
- Let somebody else fix them cars.

376
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,180
Me ? I wanna drive 'em !

377
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:35,681
- You gotta buy 'em first.
- On a buck-eighty an hour ?

378
00:34:35,982 --> 00:34:38,882
That's just a stopover
for a second-hand Chevy.

379
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:43,783
Nah, not for me. I got smart.
You're a maker or a taker. Me, I'm a taker.

380
00:34:44,085 --> 00:34:46,185
That's how you wound up in jail.

381
00:34:46,385 --> 00:34:50,385
Because I didn't know how to be
a big enough taker. I was just a stealer.

382
00:34:50,686 --> 00:34:54,686
You gotta be a big enough crook
so you can get away with anythin'.

383
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,688
Just a few more lights now.

384
00:35:05,491 --> 00:35:07,691
What did they get you for ?

385
00:35:07,991 --> 00:35:10,591
Assault and battery. Intent to kill.

386
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:12,791
Oh, that's great.

387
00:35:12,993 --> 00:35:15,993
Man come on my land
cos I didn't pay the note.

388
00:35:16,193 --> 00:35:19,093
When I gave him an argument,
he pulled a gun on me.

389
00:35:19,394 --> 00:35:22,994
- I took it away from him.
- They put you in jail for that ?

390
00:35:23,196 --> 00:35:25,596
I whipped his head good.

391
00:35:27,196 --> 00:35:29,596
Were you gonna kill him ?

392
00:35:30,397 --> 00:35:32,297
Maybe.

393
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:37,997
- If they hadn't pulled me off him, I would.
- You gotta roll with them punches.

394
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
Yeah !

395
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,799
What are you gettin' so mad about ?

396
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,100
I ain't gettin' mad, Joker.

397
00:35:44,301 --> 00:35:47,101
I been mad all my natural life.

398
00:35:47,301 --> 00:35:51,001
- I'm just tellin' you the facts of life.
- I don't wanna hear it.

399
00:35:51,304 --> 00:35:55,404
I been listenin' to that stuff all my life.
From my wife: "Be nice."

400
00:35:55,704 --> 00:36:00,104
They throwed me in solitary confinement,
and she said "Be nice."

401
00:36:00,506 --> 00:36:05,906
A man'd shortweight me. She'd say
"Be nice, or you get in trouble."

402
00:36:06,308 --> 00:36:08,908
She'd teach my kid that same damn thing.

403
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:19,210
I never could get that woman to
understand how I was feelin' inside.

404
00:36:23,912 --> 00:36:26,712
All of a sudden there
was nothin' left to say.

405
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,914
Ain't they never goin' to sleep ?

406
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:52,219
I used to think,

407
00:36:53,221 --> 00:36:55,721
if I could get away someplace,

408
00:36:57,021 --> 00:37:00,421
someplace where folks
weren't always so afraid,

409
00:37:01,723 --> 00:37:04,523
maybe she won't be
so afraid all the time.

410
00:37:10,225 --> 00:37:11,625
Well ...

411
00:37:15,227 --> 00:37:17,227
There you go.

412
00:37:22,328 --> 00:37:24,828
Well, that buttons it up for the night.

413
00:37:25,029 --> 00:37:29,329
If we leave now they'll be asleep
when we get down there. Come on.

414
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,730
What ?

415
00:37:31,931 --> 00:37:35,131
Your white face shines out
like a full moon.

416
00:37:35,332 --> 00:37:38,832
- What am I gonna do about it ?
- I don't know what you're ...

417
00:37:42,234 --> 00:37:43,734
Here.

418
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:54,437
- How's that ?
- Missed a couple of spots.

419
00:37:58,439 --> 00:38:02,839
- Now just the meanness shines through.
- Then we sure look alike.

420
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,940
Check. Come on.

421
00:40:38,863 --> 00:40:40,863
Chain.

422
00:41:10,972 --> 00:41:12,872
Can't see much.

423
00:41:13,073 --> 00:41:14,573
Go on.

424
00:41:40,681 --> 00:41:42,681
I ... I can't reach it.

425
00:41:50,983 --> 00:41:53,883
- I'm slippin'.
- Grab a hold of the chain.

426
00:41:56,386 --> 00:41:57,386
Urgh !

427
00:42:07,588 --> 00:42:09,288
Grab a hold of the chain !

428
00:42:32,796 --> 00:42:35,896
- How you doin', Joker ?
- My wrist ... My wrist ...

429
00:42:40,097 --> 00:42:42,097
I bet we woke up this whole town.

430
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:47,199
- Somebody's in there ! I heard 'em !
- Hey ! Over here !

431
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:53,000
- Do you see anybody ?
- There's somebody in there !

432
00:42:53,301 --> 00:42:56,901
- Where's Claude ? He's got the key.
- Forget it ! Let's try the back door.

433
00:42:57,202 --> 00:42:59,202
They're in there, I know it.

434
00:43:10,706 --> 00:43:14,606
You hang on to me, Joker, the best way
you can. We're gettin' outta here.

435
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:25,010
Hey, come on back here !

436
00:43:29,512 --> 00:43:31,112
Hold it, you guys !

437
00:43:39,114 --> 00:43:40,814
Here they are !

438
00:43:47,017 --> 00:43:48,617
Hold it !

439
00:43:49,517 --> 00:43:54,417
- Looks like you two boys are in trouble.
- Mac, they hurt Joe real bad !

440
00:43:54,718 --> 00:43:57,318
Say ! This one's white !

441
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,019
Here, Max. You look pretty beat.

442
00:44:04,622 --> 00:44:07,222
I figured sure we'd grab 'em
sometime today.

443
00:44:07,422 --> 00:44:09,622
Take it easy.
Here comes Captain Bligh.

444
00:44:19,026 --> 00:44:22,126
- How about a nice hot coffee, Captain ?
- No.

445
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:25,227
- I thought you'd want the casualty report.
- Go ahead.

446
00:44:25,527 --> 00:44:26,627
Three men.

447
00:44:26,727 --> 00:44:28,727
- How bad ?
- Legs.

448
00:44:28,927 --> 00:44:31,427
- Send 'em back.
- Someone's gotta go with 'em.

449
00:44:31,629 --> 00:44:34,429
- Pick someone out.
- That's a lot of men outta the line.

450
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:38,030
- What about it ?
- Solly says the trail'll get no fresher.

451
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:39,230
So ?

452
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:43,531
So I'd like to make it a matter of record
that I requested help. You refused.

453
00:44:43,832 --> 00:44:47,632
- It's your responsibility.
- It is my responsibility.

454
00:44:47,933 --> 00:44:50,033
Anythin' else you'd like to remind me of ?

455
00:44:50,234 --> 00:44:51,634
Just this.

456
00:44:51,935 --> 00:44:55,735
I happen to be civil service.
I don't have to worry about my job.

457
00:45:02,737 --> 00:45:04,937
Got a point there, Max.

458
00:45:06,138 --> 00:45:08,738
If I listened to him
I'd be callin' out the marines.

459
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:14,540
If they get away because you refused
to call in help, you'll look pretty foolish.

460
00:45:14,841 --> 00:45:17,441
And I'd have to print it, Max.

461
00:45:17,642 --> 00:45:20,242
Look, let me tell you somethin', Dave.

462
00:45:21,944 --> 00:45:25,944
I got a wife and two kids. And a mortgage.

463
00:45:26,243 --> 00:45:29,043
My job as sheriff pays me 6800 a year.

464
00:45:29,245 --> 00:45:31,945
It comes in steady.
I don't have to work too hard.

465
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:35,546
It's a good setup and I like it.
But don't frighten me about losin' it.

466
00:45:35,746 --> 00:45:38,246
I can always go back to practisin' law.

467
00:45:38,547 --> 00:45:42,047
Max ... no offence.
We've been friends a long time.

468
00:45:42,249 --> 00:45:46,749
You never made much of a livin'
as a lawyer. Stop kiddin' yourself.

469
00:45:51,852 --> 00:45:56,352
I didn't think it was possible, but
I'm beginnin' to hate those two men.

470
00:45:57,553 --> 00:45:59,453
I'll get them.

471
00:46:09,056 --> 00:46:11,956
Rafe, get rid of the women and children.

472
00:46:12,157 --> 00:46:14,157
Come on, ladies. Let's go.

473
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:17,858
- What you men fixin' to do ?
- Old-fashioned prayer meetin', ma'am.

474
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:20,459
Let's go now. Come on. Let's go.

475
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:27,060
Prayer meetin'. That's pretty funny.

476
00:46:27,361 --> 00:46:29,061
Give us a break, buddy, uh ?

477
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,761
I ain't your buddy. You got your buddy.

478
00:46:33,063 --> 00:46:34,963
Which one of you did it ?

479
00:46:36,063 --> 00:46:38,063
Did you do it ?

480
00:46:38,464 --> 00:46:40,464
Why did you do it ?

481
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:43,865
- How is he, Sam ?
- He ain't come to yet.

482
00:46:44,066 --> 00:46:46,866
- He oughta be all right.
- He oughta be.

483
00:46:48,967 --> 00:46:50,967
Did he do it ?

484
00:46:51,168 --> 00:46:53,668
Are you protectin' your buddy ?

485
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:57,570
It don't matter. You're both gonna hang.

486
00:46:58,569 --> 00:47:01,469
You can't do anythin' to us.
We're escaped cons.

487
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,470
- So ?
- So they're lookin' for us.

488
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:05,271
What you gonna do when they find us ?

489
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:08,472
You gonna be crow meat
when they find you.

490
00:47:08,672 --> 00:47:11,172
Well, you ain't gonna get away with it.

491
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:15,074
Nobody's gonna know
who pulled the rope.

492
00:47:17,676 --> 00:47:20,976
Don't you know there's a reward
for escaped convicts ?

493
00:47:22,877 --> 00:47:25,377
Rewards always say "dead or alive".

494
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,880
Don't you understand ?

495
00:47:34,179 --> 00:47:36,179
You can't go lynchin' me.

496
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:38,380
I'm a white man !

497
00:47:40,382 --> 00:47:41,582
You are ?

498
00:47:41,782 --> 00:47:44,482
I'll tell you the kind of white man you are.

499
00:47:46,783 --> 00:47:48,583
- Spit on him.
- For God's sake ...

500
00:47:48,784 --> 00:47:51,484
- Go on ! Spit on him.
- Mac ...

501
00:47:51,685 --> 00:47:53,685
Let me alone, Sam !

502
00:47:54,385 --> 00:47:57,085
We're just havin' a little fun, boys ?

503
00:47:57,687 --> 00:47:59,587
Come on, you heard me.

504
00:48:06,789 --> 00:48:07,689
Wait !

505
00:48:07,889 --> 00:48:10,189
Outta my way, Sam,
or you'll have trouble, too.

506
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:14,290
- I told you. Joe's gonna be all right.
- You told me. Fine !

507
00:48:17,793 --> 00:48:20,193
You just don't give a damn, do ya ?

508
00:48:25,894 --> 00:48:30,194
All right. The rest of you big men,
you wanna lynch 'em, huh ?

509
00:48:32,096 --> 00:48:33,996
You, Glover.

510
00:48:34,997 --> 00:48:37,297
You look anxious. Go ahead.

511
00:48:37,597 --> 00:48:39,997
Tie it around their necks. Go on !

512
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,099
You want blood, huh ?

513
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:49,500
Well, here. Go ahead ! Chop 'em up !

514
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,302
Go on !

515
00:48:57,103 --> 00:48:59,503
Or do you wanna burn 'em ?

516
00:48:59,704 --> 00:49:03,704
Do you wanna burn 'em, huh ?
You wanna burn 'em ?

517
00:49:05,206 --> 00:49:09,106
Or do you wanna burn 'em ?
Go on ! Burn 'em !

518
00:49:11,007 --> 00:49:12,307
Mac !

519
00:49:17,108 --> 00:49:19,508
Go on ! Burn their eyes out !

520
00:49:29,713 --> 00:49:31,713
Now,

521
00:49:31,912 --> 00:49:34,112
any more big men ?

522
00:49:37,315 --> 00:49:40,215
Joe's all right.
Took six stitches, but he's OK.

523
00:49:41,716 --> 00:49:44,216
All right. Lock them two up.

524
00:49:44,516 --> 00:49:47,816
I'll take 'em back in the mornin'
in the wagons.

525
00:49:48,117 --> 00:49:51,817
Put Mac in the shack where he belongs.
The rest of you go to bed.

526
00:50:13,125 --> 00:50:17,125
Long gone

527
00:50:18,826 --> 00:50:20,826
Ain't he lucky

528
00:50:22,927 --> 00:50:26,127
Long gone

529
00:50:27,729 --> 00:50:29,729
To Kentucky

530
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:34,329
Long gone

531
00:50:36,631 --> 00:50:38,531
What I mean

532
00:50:38,932 --> 00:50:42,332
Long gone Sam on a bowlin' green

533
00:50:42,933 --> 00:50:45,233
Bowlin' green

534
00:50:48,734 --> 00:50:50,734
Sewin' machine

535
00:50:53,336 --> 00:50:55,336
Little kitten sittin'

536
00:50:57,537 --> 00:50:59,437
On a sewin' machine

537
00:51:02,338 --> 00:51:04,338
Sewin' machine

538
00:51:07,038 --> 00:51:08,938
Sew so fast

539
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:13,541
Sew eleven stitches

540
00:51:15,342 --> 00:51:18,242
You musta been crazy
to do a thing like that.

541
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:21,842
They might've beat us to death.
They still might.

542
00:51:22,844 --> 00:51:25,544
What you got to live for, Joker ?

543
00:51:25,845 --> 00:51:29,645
You wanna spend the next 20 years
on some chain gang, bustin' rock ?

544
00:51:29,845 --> 00:51:32,245
It's better than bein' dead.

545
00:51:33,647 --> 00:51:36,247
You ever seen a lynchin' ?

546
00:51:36,448 --> 00:51:37,548
Why ?

547
00:51:37,749 --> 00:51:43,049
Cos anybody as scared as you was, man,
they ... they got to have seen a lynchin'.

548
00:51:43,449 --> 00:51:46,549
Yeah, I seen a lynchin'.
I seen what they do to a guy,

549
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:51,350
how they drag him outta jail in the middle
of the night, like that mob out there.

550
00:51:51,652 --> 00:51:54,052
They start drinkin'.
Then they start thinkin'.

551
00:51:54,252 --> 00:51:56,652
And Big Sam, he falls asleep somewhere.

552
00:51:56,853 --> 00:52:00,153
Then that mob comes in here
and they get us. Then what ?

553
00:52:01,455 --> 00:52:05,755
That's mighty easy for you, Joker.
You just tell 'em you're a white man.

554
00:52:30,362 --> 00:52:34,462
Wait a minute. What are you doin' ?
I didn't hear any wagon bein' hitched up.

555
00:52:34,764 --> 00:52:36,464
I'm lettin' you loose.

556
00:52:36,564 --> 00:52:38,764
What do you mean,
you're lettin' us loose ?

557
00:52:39,065 --> 00:52:41,665
I already told you. I'm lettin' you loose.

558
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:57,970
Wait a minute.

559
00:53:09,574 --> 00:53:11,874
How about lettin' us have that crowbar ?

560
00:53:12,075 --> 00:53:15,075
Don't go to pressin' your luck too far, boy.

561
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:16,375
Come on.

562
00:53:16,575 --> 00:53:18,075
Wait a minute.

563
00:53:18,276 --> 00:53:21,176
If you get caught,
wasn't nobody let you loose.

564
00:53:21,477 --> 00:53:23,777
You broke out yourselves. Understand ?

565
00:53:23,978 --> 00:53:25,978
Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

566
00:53:36,681 --> 00:53:38,581
Run, chicken.

567
00:53:38,881 --> 00:53:40,181
Run.

568
00:54:15,492 --> 00:54:17,892
Hold on, man. Wait. Wait.

569
00:54:19,993 --> 00:54:21,993
I gotta rest.

570
00:54:31,196 --> 00:54:33,596
We musta run a million miles.

571
00:54:34,497 --> 00:54:36,897
How far do you think we run ?

572
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:45,700
Man, you sure can run. You'd have killed
us both if I didn't make you stop.

573
00:54:54,902 --> 00:54:58,702
Why don't you say somethin' ?
What have you got to squawk about ?

574
00:54:59,005 --> 00:55:00,905
We got away, didn't we ?

575
00:55:04,606 --> 00:55:06,706
You got nothin' to say, huh ?

576
00:55:09,307 --> 00:55:11,407
You oughta be thankin' me.

577
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:15,208
You didn't put up any fight.
I had to do all the talkin'.

578
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:21,610
Look, man, don't gimme that look.

579
00:55:21,811 --> 00:55:26,411
You shoulda got what was comin' to ya,
after spittin' in that guy's face.

580
00:55:28,612 --> 00:55:30,212
Why, you ... !

581
00:55:31,413 --> 00:55:33,713
You afraid of catchin' my colour ?

582
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:37,714
- You pickin' a hand to me ?
- To you ? The bigshot taker ?

583
00:55:38,015 --> 00:55:40,115
You're just a talker !

584
00:55:44,118 --> 00:55:49,018
Tell me all about Charlie Potatoes, when
the chain's off and nobody's chasin' ya !

585
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:50,218
Come on.

586
00:55:50,418 --> 00:55:51,718
You can't, can ya ?

587
00:55:51,819 --> 00:55:56,019
You can't, because you're nothin'. Not
even a man ! You're a monkey on a stick !

588
00:55:56,421 --> 00:56:00,021
That cracker mob back there -
they pulled the string and you jumped !

589
00:56:02,022 --> 00:56:04,222
You said one day
we were gonna tangle, Joker.

590
00:56:04,523 --> 00:56:07,523
You said the time was gonna come,
and that time is now !

591
00:56:45,334 --> 00:56:49,334
- I'm gonna kill you !
- That's right, white man.

592
00:56:49,934 --> 00:56:51,934
You kill me.

593
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,940
Only it ain't so easy to kill me, is it ?

594
00:57:10,241 --> 00:57:12,741
(kid) Put up your hands !

595
00:57:14,242 --> 00:57:15,942
Come on up here !

596
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:44,550
- Let's get outta here !
- Wait a minute.

597
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:47,850
- Cullen, there may be people around !
- Wait a minute !

598
00:57:53,453 --> 00:57:55,753
- He bumped his head.
- Come on.

599
00:58:03,856 --> 00:58:05,956
Let me go !

600
00:58:06,157 --> 00:58:09,957
Keep him away from me !
Don't let him hurt me !

601
00:58:11,858 --> 00:58:14,958
- He ain't gonna hurt ya.
- Where you live, kid ?

602
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,759
- Go on, answer him.
- Over the hill.

603
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:20,061
That way ?

604
00:58:20,261 --> 00:58:21,861
- Tell him.
- Yeah.

605
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,560
- What you doin' out here ?
- Huntin'.

606
00:58:25,161 --> 00:58:29,061
- Your pa let you out huntin' by yourself ?
- He ain't here no more.

607
00:58:32,764 --> 00:58:35,464
- Who you live with ?
- My ma.

608
00:58:36,265 --> 00:58:38,765
Just you and your ma ?

609
00:58:39,765 --> 00:58:43,865
How come you're chained together
like that ? Are you takin' him to jail ?

610
00:58:44,168 --> 00:58:46,768
Well, somethin' like that.

611
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:51,467
You must have a lot of friends,
a smart kid like you. A lot of neighbours.

612
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:55,070
Uh-uh. Just Ma and me.
We work the farm.

613
00:58:55,271 --> 00:58:59,971
Sometimes on Sunday we go over to
Cumberland, to visit my Uncle George.

614
00:59:00,372 --> 00:59:02,772
- What's your name, boy ?
- Billy.

615
00:59:02,973 --> 00:59:05,773
Billy, uh ? Come on,
we'll get you home, Billy.

616
00:59:31,481 --> 00:59:33,381
What's the matter ?

617
00:59:34,181 --> 00:59:36,481
Nothin', Ma. I'm all right.

618
00:59:38,683 --> 00:59:39,683
What do you want ?

619
00:59:39,982 --> 00:59:43,482
Don't get excited, lady.
All we want is somethin' to eat.

620
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:50,385
Come on.

621
01:00:00,488 --> 01:00:01,488
Kid, come here.

622
01:00:01,689 --> 01:00:04,289
- Where you goin' ?
- You wanted somethin' to eat.

623
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:08,190
- You got a chisel and a big hammer ?
- In the shed, if I can find 'em.

624
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:11,090
- Is it OK, Ma ?
- Go ahead.

625
01:00:18,795 --> 01:00:21,295
Where's his ? Get him some.

626
01:00:21,495 --> 01:00:23,095
Go on !

627
01:00:32,097 --> 01:00:34,597
You ain't feelin' so good, eh, Joker ?

628
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:37,398
I'm feelin' fine. Don't worry about me.

629
01:00:37,598 --> 01:00:39,798
I ain't worried about ya.

630
01:00:41,701 --> 01:00:44,101
- I got some coffee.
- Thanks.

631
01:00:52,003 --> 01:00:54,003
Him too ?

632
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:24,412
What are you lookin' at ?

633
01:01:38,115 --> 01:01:40,115
Where you from ?

634
01:01:41,418 --> 01:01:43,318
You can talk to me.

635
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:47,118
You don't have to be afraid to talk to me.

636
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:50,619
Gets lonesome here.

637
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:55,020
That's a nice picture.

638
01:01:57,621 --> 01:02:00,121
- I made it myself.
- Oh, yeah ?

639
01:02:00,422 --> 01:02:02,922
It ain't so much. You buy 'em in the store.

640
01:02:03,123 --> 01:02:07,223
It's got numbers on it where you're
supposed to put the colours, you know.

641
01:02:07,524 --> 01:02:09,724
It's all right.

642
01:02:09,924 --> 01:02:12,324
I like pretty things.

643
01:02:15,826 --> 01:02:18,026
Did you paint that one, too ?

644
01:02:18,928 --> 01:02:20,528
That ?

645
01:02:20,727 --> 01:02:22,027
No.

646
01:02:22,329 --> 01:02:24,929
No, I cut that out of a magazine.

647
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:29,130
What is it ?

648
01:02:29,331 --> 01:02:32,831
"A scene of gay revelry at the
Mardi Gras in Old New Orleans."

649
01:02:34,132 --> 01:02:36,132
Where's that kid ?

650
01:02:36,332 --> 01:02:38,532
He'll be back.

651
01:02:39,334 --> 01:02:41,734
Relax, Cullen. He'll be back.

652
01:02:46,935 --> 01:02:49,235
I've been to the Mardi Gras.

653
01:02:51,037 --> 01:02:53,337
Yeah ? Is it really like what it says ?

654
01:02:53,637 --> 01:02:55,437
It's all right.

655
01:02:55,637 --> 01:02:58,137
You mean it ain't like what it says ?

656
01:02:58,438 --> 01:03:02,738
No, it's fine. It's very nice.
A lot of music and a lot of dancin'.

657
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,740
Good-lookin' women.

658
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:08,540
Oh, I ...

659
01:03:08,841 --> 01:03:12,441
I must look awful. I ...
I been doin' the washin'.

660
01:03:18,743 --> 01:03:21,043
Are you gonna be stayin' long ?

661
01:03:21,244 --> 01:03:22,544
No ?

662
01:03:25,147 --> 01:03:27,247
They comin' after you ?

663
01:03:33,848 --> 01:03:36,248
There's a train.

664
01:03:36,448 --> 01:03:40,748
Tomorrow. Hits the ridge about
one o'clock in the afternoon.

665
01:03:41,049 --> 01:03:45,249
It's a good place to catch it, too.
It goes slow up the ridge.

666
01:03:49,853 --> 01:03:53,253
How come ... how come you know
so much about the train ?

667
01:03:53,453 --> 01:03:55,453
My husband used to work for the line.

668
01:03:55,754 --> 01:03:57,254
I found 'em.

669
01:04:04,656 --> 01:04:09,256
- You got enough room for a swing ?
- You just hold that chain, Joker.

670
01:04:16,359 --> 01:04:17,959
Now me.

671
01:04:20,361 --> 01:04:22,361
Here, hold that.

672
01:04:40,467 --> 01:04:42,467
We cut loose now.

673
01:04:44,768 --> 01:04:46,768
What's the matter with him ?

674
01:04:49,169 --> 01:04:52,369
He's sick. He got poison in his system.

675
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:55,370
- Heat some water !
- Stay where you are, kid.

676
01:04:55,571 --> 01:04:57,771
Do like I told you !

677
01:04:58,572 --> 01:05:01,172
Well, you get in there with him.

678
01:05:17,077 --> 01:05:20,677
All right, they hit you. Then what ?
What did you do to them ?

679
01:05:20,978 --> 01:05:24,978
I don't know. The next thing I know,
the doctor is fixin' me up.

680
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:30,180
Do you know what happened last night ?

681
01:05:32,082 --> 01:05:34,082
No, huh ?

682
01:05:34,983 --> 01:05:36,883
You, lady ?

683
01:05:38,284 --> 01:05:41,284
You ? Were you deaf and blind
last night, too ?

684
01:05:41,483 --> 01:05:43,383
They sent us women away.

685
01:05:43,585 --> 01:05:44,985
Why ?

686
01:05:45,185 --> 01:05:47,185
Ask them.

687
01:05:54,988 --> 01:05:56,788
Sam, what did you do with 'em ?

688
01:05:56,989 --> 01:06:00,589
Like I told you before, Sheriff.
We caught 'em, locked 'em up.

689
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,890
They broke out and ran away.

690
01:06:03,189 --> 01:06:05,589
Those jimmy marks are
on the outside of the door.

691
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:09,990
They didn't break out. Somebody
broke in and got them. Who was it ?

692
01:06:10,292 --> 01:06:15,192
I wouldn't know about that, Sheriff.
I run a turpentine camp, not a jail.

693
01:06:15,493 --> 01:06:18,493
Who came for them, Sam ?
Who came and got them ?

694
01:06:19,795 --> 01:06:22,695
Sam, if you lynched 'em,
you'd better tell me now.

695
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:25,096
The dogs are gonna find 'em anyhow.

696
01:06:25,297 --> 01:06:31,897
Why'd we wanna kill 'em ? Appears to me
like you're better rigged for that than us.

697
01:06:32,399 --> 01:06:34,299
All right, that's enough.

698
01:06:36,499 --> 01:06:37,999
Solly, get goin'.

699
01:06:38,099 --> 01:06:42,099
You've been rushin' my dogs since
early this mornin' ! They're bushed !

700
01:06:42,401 --> 01:06:45,701
I'm tired of your complaining
about your dogs !

701
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,002
Will you get goin' !

702
01:06:48,103 --> 01:06:51,303
Wait, Max. How about us ?
We're dead tired on our feet.

703
01:06:51,603 --> 01:06:53,803
- Max, have a heart.
- It'll be dark soon.

704
01:06:54,104 --> 01:06:57,104
You wanted to be deputies, didn't you ?

705
01:06:57,405 --> 01:07:01,105
Well, you're under orders,
so get ready to move out !

706
01:07:01,407 --> 01:07:02,507
Come on, come on.

707
01:07:02,607 --> 01:07:06,807
Call Cumberland. Tell them
I want every man they can spare.

708
01:07:07,109 --> 01:07:11,509
These men better be field-equipped.
It'll be dark before they can get started.

709
01:07:11,809 --> 01:07:15,509
I don't care when they start !
You get them movin' !

710
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:18,610
All right, Sheriff.

711
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:20,511
All right.

712
01:07:26,612 --> 01:07:29,912
You know that's the first time
I seen him smile ?

713
01:07:31,015 --> 01:07:32,015
Yeah.

714
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,100
Where is he ?

715
01:09:14,303 --> 01:09:17,103
- How long I been asleep ?
- Couple of hours.

716
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:19,804
- Where's the kid ?
- In the other room.

717
01:09:21,104 --> 01:09:23,804
- I'd better wake Cullen.
- No.

718
01:09:24,105 --> 01:09:25,905
Don't go yet.

719
01:09:26,107 --> 01:09:29,707
- You're feverish. You got plenty of time.
- What time is it ?

720
01:09:30,008 --> 01:09:32,008
About two o'clock.

721
01:09:33,309 --> 01:09:36,509
You been sittin' here all night ?

722
01:09:36,911 --> 01:09:39,711
Why don't you go and get some sleep ?

723
01:09:40,012 --> 01:09:41,912
I want to stay.

724
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:46,914
What is it ?

725
01:09:49,115 --> 01:09:53,715
I was thinkin' of the last time somebody
sat up all night takin' care of me.

726
01:09:55,117 --> 01:09:57,017
Your wife ?

727
01:09:58,118 --> 01:09:59,418
No.

728
01:10:00,819 --> 01:10:05,419
A skinny old man with a moustache.
He had red eyes and a torn T-shirt.

729
01:10:07,222 --> 01:10:09,622
He was an orderly in the prison hospital.

730
01:10:09,823 --> 01:10:13,223
I had a sunstroke from
workin' on the road gang.

731
01:10:15,625 --> 01:10:17,625
I ain't married.

732
01:10:19,827 --> 01:10:21,527
What's it like ?

733
01:10:21,726 --> 01:10:24,826
- What's what like ?
- You know. Prison.

734
01:10:28,730 --> 01:10:31,130
How you gonna explain it ?

735
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:33,830
Is it lonesome ?

736
01:10:35,532 --> 01:10:37,432
Yeah.

737
01:10:39,533 --> 01:10:42,033
What happened to your old man ?

738
01:10:42,334 --> 01:10:44,734
He run off ... eight months ago.

739
01:10:46,236 --> 01:10:48,236
I been stuck here.

740
01:10:49,638 --> 01:10:52,038
Must get pretty lonesome for ya.

741
01:10:53,038 --> 01:10:55,338
It's like that in jail, ain't it ?

742
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:59,340
Yeah. It's like that.

743
01:11:02,943 --> 01:11:06,243
Does it ever get really bad ?

744
01:11:06,943 --> 01:11:09,343
No. No, I mean ...

745
01:11:10,045 --> 01:11:14,545
I mean so bad that you just feel
kinda empty inside. You know ?

746
01:11:15,747 --> 01:11:20,447
Like a big empty thing, and all you
wanna do is fill it up with tears.

747
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:25,050
I'll tell you somethin'.

748
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:28,250
You fill it up with tears and you're a goner.

749
01:11:29,052 --> 01:11:30,952
What can you do ?

750
01:11:32,453 --> 01:11:34,853
I fill it up with dreams.

751
01:11:36,054 --> 01:11:39,154
You gotta know about somethin'
before you can dream about it.

752
01:11:39,555 --> 01:11:41,455
No, you don't.

753
01:11:41,656 --> 01:11:45,156
Look, I was born 20 miles from here.

754
01:11:45,857 --> 01:11:48,857
And I just don't know nothin' else.

755
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:52,160
You don't have to know.

756
01:11:52,761 --> 01:11:54,861
All you have to do is want.

757
01:11:55,661 --> 01:11:59,361
Then you make up a million pictures
in your own head.

758
01:11:59,763 --> 01:12:02,063
Pictures ?

759
01:12:02,864 --> 01:12:06,364
- What kind of pictures ?
- All kinds of pictures.

760
01:12:07,466 --> 01:12:11,166
Different things, different places,
different people.

761
01:12:11,466 --> 01:12:15,166
All the things you ever wanted,
but you ain't gonna get.

762
01:12:15,969 --> 01:12:19,369
Sometimes it's music and
bright lights and paper streamers,

763
01:12:19,569 --> 01:12:22,069
and I'm dancin' in the streets.

764
01:12:24,571 --> 01:12:27,071
Like the Mardi Gras ?

765
01:12:27,473 --> 01:12:30,173
Just like the Mardi Gras.

766
01:12:34,675 --> 01:12:36,575
And sometimes ...

767
01:12:38,177 --> 01:12:42,077
Sometimes I'm on a boat, a long boat,

768
01:12:42,279 --> 01:12:45,479
and ... I'm goin' far away.

769
01:12:47,681 --> 01:12:51,181
I'm goin' to places
that I never seen before.

770
01:12:53,982 --> 01:12:55,882
White sand.

771
01:12:58,085 --> 01:12:59,985
Hot sun.

772
01:13:02,486 --> 01:13:04,386
And tall buildings.

773
01:13:06,486 --> 01:13:08,886
All tall buildings ...

774
01:13:10,189 --> 01:13:13,389
reachin' way up into the sky.

775
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:18,491
Tall buildings made of glass.

776
01:13:25,894 --> 01:13:28,394
And there's always somebody waitin'.

777
01:13:30,696 --> 01:13:32,596
Somebody clean,

778
01:13:34,197 --> 01:13:36,197
and warm,

779
01:13:36,298 --> 01:13:37,598
and nice.

780
01:13:42,801 --> 01:13:44,801
Is she beautiful ?

781
01:13:53,205 --> 01:13:55,205
I better get Cullen.

782
01:13:59,806 --> 01:14:02,006
Is she prettier than me ?

783
01:14:05,209 --> 01:14:07,109
It's been so long.

784
01:14:11,111 --> 01:14:14,411
I get the dreams mixed up
with the real thing.

785
01:14:16,213 --> 01:14:18,213
It's real now.

786
01:14:22,214 --> 01:14:24,214
Don't go away.

787
01:14:25,516 --> 01:14:27,516
I ain't goin' anywhere.

788
01:14:52,826 --> 01:14:54,726
Don't go away.

789
01:16:19,257 --> 01:16:20,557
Hi.

790
01:16:20,758 --> 01:16:23,158
Mornin' ! You're up early.

791
01:16:31,161 --> 01:16:34,061
- I'll change your dressin'.
- It's OK.

792
01:16:39,564 --> 01:16:41,464
That's great.

793
01:16:44,466 --> 01:16:46,166
Thank you.

794
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:56,970
- I made you some breakfast.
- Fine.

795
01:16:58,672 --> 01:17:01,472
What's that ? That your old man's ?

796
01:17:03,074 --> 01:17:05,574
You're just about the same size.

797
01:17:05,774 --> 01:17:09,574
You're a good-lookin' woman.
He must've been crazy to leave.

798
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:12,575
Oh, this place is no good. It needs a man.

799
01:17:12,776 --> 01:17:16,776
- He'll be back one day.
- Yeah ? Well, I won't be here.

800
01:17:17,078 --> 01:17:20,978
- Where you figure on goin' ?
- Where do you ?

801
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:24,080
- I'm bound for Rio.
- Listen ...

802
01:17:24,281 --> 01:17:26,881
- I ain't got time.
- Wait a minute.

803
01:17:28,682 --> 01:17:32,282
- You like me, don't you ?
- Yeah, I like you. I like you a lot.

804
01:17:34,084 --> 01:17:35,784
Take me with you.

805
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:41,285
- Law's on my tail. I'm runnin' scared.
- I don't care. Take me with you.

806
01:17:41,587 --> 01:17:45,387
- You gonna ride the freights with me ?
- We don't have to. I got a car.

807
01:17:47,489 --> 01:17:50,089
- A car ?
- In the shed, in back.

808
01:17:51,491 --> 01:17:54,891
Wait a minute ! It's busted ! It won't start !

809
01:17:59,194 --> 01:18:02,894
- Get in and try it !
- Well, it won't start.

810
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:05,095
- How long's it been here ?
- Three weeks.

811
01:18:05,295 --> 01:18:07,195
All right, hit it.

812
01:18:07,397 --> 01:18:10,897
- Try it again. Try it again !
- I am !

813
01:18:11,198 --> 01:18:14,498
- It's the battery. You got a crank ?
- I don't know. Do I ?

814
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:20,100
- Put it in neutral.
- It's in neutral.

815
01:18:21,102 --> 01:18:22,502
OK ?

816
01:18:35,106 --> 01:18:37,306
- I gotta get Cullen.
- We can't take him !

817
01:18:37,507 --> 01:18:39,707
- Why not ?
- They'll recognise you !

818
01:18:39,808 --> 01:18:44,408
- They're gonna spot us anyway.
- No, we'll travel as man and wife.

819
01:18:44,910 --> 01:18:46,710
What about Cullen ?

820
01:18:46,811 --> 01:18:49,711
What's the difference if they're
followin' one or two of you ?

821
01:18:50,012 --> 01:18:51,612
What about Billy ?

822
01:18:51,713 --> 01:18:54,613
We can drop him off at my brother's,
then go south.

823
01:18:54,913 --> 01:18:57,413
We're goin' too fast. I gotta think.

824
01:18:57,614 --> 01:19:01,114
Honey, there ain't no time to think.
Will you come on ?

825
01:19:02,516 --> 01:19:05,916
All right. All right, get packed.
We'll leave in a couple ...

826
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:24,224
Nice shirt.

827
01:19:25,125 --> 01:19:27,125
We're goin' south.

828
01:19:28,726 --> 01:19:31,026
- We ?
- Me and her.

829
01:19:33,629 --> 01:19:36,029
- In this ?
- Yeah, it runs.

830
01:19:37,529 --> 01:19:40,729
Yeah ? You're wastin' your gas.

831
01:19:43,632 --> 01:19:46,232
They'll be watchin' the roads.

832
01:19:46,433 --> 01:19:49,433
They'll be watchin' where
the dogs are goin'.

833
01:19:50,334 --> 01:19:53,534
That kinda makes me the bait, don't it ?

834
01:19:55,035 --> 01:19:59,935
Cullen, travellin' together we're like
a sign that says "come and get us".

835
01:20:01,438 --> 01:20:04,438
He's too weak to travel on foot anyway.

836
01:20:09,041 --> 01:20:11,441
You got the same chance alone.
Maybe better.

837
01:20:22,846 --> 01:20:25,146
I'll fix you somethin' to eat.

838
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:38,452
You got it all figured out.

839
01:20:43,353 --> 01:20:45,953
Hey, you better go and get washed, Billy.

840
01:20:51,957 --> 01:20:54,057
How far is it to that railroad ?

841
01:20:54,358 --> 01:20:56,858
About 12 miles,
if you go through the hills.

842
01:20:57,159 --> 01:20:59,559
I'm fixin' sandwiches.
There's coffee there.

843
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:01,960
If I go through the hills ?

844
01:21:02,161 --> 01:21:05,361
Or you can short-cut through the swamp.

845
01:21:05,661 --> 01:21:06,461
Swamp ?

846
01:21:06,662 --> 01:21:10,062
Save you a couple of hours.
Make it harder for the dogs.

847
01:21:10,463 --> 01:21:12,663
You can find it easy.

848
01:21:12,964 --> 01:21:15,364
Which way is that ?

849
01:21:15,665 --> 01:21:18,465
Go right up here by the shed.
You'll see a path.

850
01:21:18,766 --> 01:21:21,866
Follow that till you get to the swamp.

851
01:21:22,167 --> 01:21:26,567
You'll see a great big cypress over on
your left about half a mile. Follow that.

852
01:21:26,869 --> 01:21:27,869
Then what ?

853
01:21:27,969 --> 01:21:32,969
Then nothin'. The rest is easy.
Just head for the railroad, that's all.

854
01:21:37,973 --> 01:21:39,973
Thanks for the grub.

855
01:21:46,077 --> 01:21:47,977
Hey, Cullen.

856
01:21:48,878 --> 01:21:49,978
Yeah ?

857
01:21:52,479 --> 01:21:54,579
So long.

858
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:58,880
So long, Joker.

859
01:22:38,295 --> 01:22:40,295
Here, I'll burn that.

860
01:22:42,097 --> 01:22:45,797
Not now, honey, please ...
We got plenty of time. Suppose ...

861
01:22:57,002 --> 01:22:59,102
We're goin' on a trip to Cumberland.

862
01:22:59,203 --> 01:23:01,003
- Now ?
- Now.

863
01:23:01,204 --> 01:23:05,404
- Go and take your clothes off the line.
- Cumberland ? With him ?

864
01:23:05,805 --> 01:23:07,205
Yeah.

865
01:23:07,406 --> 01:23:09,406
You like him, don't you ?

866
01:23:09,607 --> 01:23:11,707
Sure. He's all right.

867
01:23:11,908 --> 01:23:13,908
Well, go on.

868
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:20,310
You better talk to that kid.

869
01:23:20,511 --> 01:23:23,211
On the way. He's a smart kid.

870
01:23:37,917 --> 01:23:40,817
I wonder what they'll do
to Cullen if they catch him.

871
01:23:41,118 --> 01:23:43,118
Don't worry, they won't.

872
01:23:50,921 --> 01:23:54,421
- What makes you so sure ?
- Look, will you quit worryin' ?

873
01:23:54,623 --> 01:24:00,023
They ain't gonna catch him, cos he ain't
never gonna get out of that swamp alive.

874
01:24:02,026 --> 01:24:04,226
What ? Didn't you tell him right ?

875
01:24:04,427 --> 01:24:07,927
There ain't no right.
It's all bogs and quicksand.

876
01:24:10,929 --> 01:24:13,129
Why'd you do it ?

877
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:16,930
Well, suppose they caught him ?
What if he told 'em ?

878
01:24:18,832 --> 01:24:21,032
What if he told 'em what ?

879
01:24:22,333 --> 01:24:25,533
What if he told 'em what ?
What could he tell 'em ?

880
01:24:26,334 --> 01:24:29,034
So they wouldn't come lookin'.
So we could have time.

881
01:24:29,436 --> 01:24:33,836
- Time for what ?
- Time ! Time for us to get away !

882
01:24:34,138 --> 01:24:38,438
To get to a city - a big city,
so big they could never find you !

883
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:44,540
Oh, look ! Look, I got $400
insurance money saved up.

884
01:24:44,842 --> 01:24:48,342
We could live good.
Do all those things you was talkin' about.

885
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:52,542
We could go dancin', and eat
in restaurants, and go to shows.

886
01:24:52,845 --> 01:24:54,845
You could start a whole new life.

887
01:24:55,045 --> 01:24:58,545
And when we needed more money
I could sell the farm ...

888
01:25:00,047 --> 01:25:03,547
- What should I do with these ?
- You'll think of somethin'.

889
01:25:03,748 --> 01:25:06,848
- Drop 'em down the well.
- Like you dropped Cullen in the swamp.

890
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:10,950
What are you gettin' so excited
about that Negro for ? I did it for you !

891
01:25:11,151 --> 01:25:14,651
- You don't even know me !
- For us ! For the two of us !

892
01:25:14,952 --> 01:25:19,152
- You don't even know my name.
- Well, I don't care what they call ya !

893
01:25:19,555 --> 01:25:23,055
They call me Johnny. That's what
they call me. They call me Johnny.

894
01:25:23,255 --> 01:25:25,855
Johnny. Oh, Johnny ...

895
01:25:26,056 --> 01:25:28,556
You don't even know me.

896
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:32,857
Please, we don't have time. You said so
yourself. They're comin' after ya.

897
01:25:33,059 --> 01:25:35,259
You don't know anythin' about me.

898
01:25:36,661 --> 01:25:38,861
No ! Where you goin' ?!

899
01:25:39,062 --> 01:25:41,462
- Get outta the way !
- What'd I do wrong ?!

900
01:25:41,663 --> 01:25:43,663
Please, what'd I do wrong ?

901
01:25:43,962 --> 01:25:46,262
Listen to me, Johnny. Please listen.

902
01:25:47,064 --> 01:25:49,864
All my life I've been waitin'
to get away from here.

903
01:25:50,065 --> 01:25:52,665
From the mud gumbo, and the loneliness.

904
01:25:53,866 --> 01:25:58,466
I'd only see my husband two times
a week, and he didn't come back.

905
01:25:59,569 --> 01:26:02,969
I don't blame him, but I don't
wanna stay here either.

906
01:26:03,870 --> 01:26:08,170
Oh, Johnny, I'm beggin' ya !
Oh, please take me with ya !

907
01:26:08,472 --> 01:26:11,372
Don't leave me here, Johnny, please ...

908
01:26:28,779 --> 01:26:32,679
- Charlie, bring in that water, will you ?
- Here. Take your full ration.

909
01:26:33,081 --> 01:26:36,281
- Kid, what'd they talk about ?
- I don't know.

910
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:38,682
You don't know, uh ? OK, beat it.

911
01:26:38,982 --> 01:26:41,482
They're not around here.
Everything's clear.

912
01:26:41,684 --> 01:26:46,584
All right, so they ate. Then what ?
They must've taken somethin' with 'em !

913
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:51,286
- Nothin' you could put 'em in jail for.
- Lady, you're not cooperatin'.

914
01:26:51,487 --> 01:26:54,287
Let's not waste any more time, Frank.

915
01:26:56,389 --> 01:26:58,389
OK, let's go.

916
01:27:01,291 --> 01:27:05,191
Look, ma'am, I don't know what
you've been thinkin' or why.

917
01:27:06,393 --> 01:27:11,493
Whatever it is, it can't work. Cos,
so help me, they're goin' back in jail.

918
01:27:16,096 --> 01:27:17,296
Cullen !

919
01:27:19,599 --> 01:27:21,099
Cullen !

920
01:27:21,298 --> 01:27:22,998
Where are you ?!

921
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:24,199
Cullen !

922
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:29,400
Cullen !

923
01:27:31,302 --> 01:27:33,702
Cullen, where are you ?!

924
01:27:35,604 --> 01:27:36,904
Cullen !

925
01:27:37,405 --> 01:27:38,805
Cullen !

926
01:27:43,007 --> 01:27:44,507
Cullen !

927
01:27:46,908 --> 01:27:48,908
Cullen, where are you ?!

928
01:27:49,108 --> 01:27:51,108
Cullen !

929
01:27:54,511 --> 01:27:56,111
What do you want ?

930
01:27:57,512 --> 01:28:00,612
- Cullen, I been lookin' all over for you.
- They catchin' up ?

931
01:28:00,913 --> 01:28:02,313
Yeah.

932
01:28:02,413 --> 01:28:05,013
How come you're here ?
What you want with me ?

933
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:11,516
That woman told you wrong.

934
01:28:11,717 --> 01:28:14,117
Why'd she do that ?

935
01:28:17,919 --> 01:28:20,619
She said if they caught you you'd squeal.

936
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:23,920
- What happened to your shoulder ?
- Kid shot me.

937
01:28:27,323 --> 01:28:30,623
If we hit high ground,
we can still make it. Come on.

938
01:28:30,824 --> 01:28:33,724
- Cullen, I can't make it.
- Come on !

939
01:28:34,826 --> 01:28:36,426
Cullen, I can't make it !

940
01:28:36,525 --> 01:28:39,525
Come on, man, you draggin' on the chain.

941
01:28:55,833 --> 01:29:01,633
That dame.
Why would she do a thing like that ?

942
01:29:02,036 --> 01:29:06,136
- She was just tryin' to help ya.
- She sure helped, all right.

943
01:29:06,337 --> 01:29:09,337
Can't blame a body
for what they don't know.

944
01:29:10,638 --> 01:29:12,538
I blame her.

945
01:29:13,039 --> 01:29:15,039
I blame her, all right.

946
01:29:36,048 --> 01:29:37,248
Halt !

947
01:29:37,348 --> 01:29:41,848
- Sweetheart picked up the scent, all right !
- They can't be far away.

948
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:44,750
Solly, bring up the Dobermans.

949
01:29:52,154 --> 01:29:54,754
- Wait a minute.
- What's the matter ?

950
01:29:55,054 --> 01:29:58,754
- No dogs.
- Do we have to go all over that again ?

951
01:29:59,156 --> 01:30:01,056
No killer dogs, Frank !

952
01:30:01,257 --> 01:30:04,257
Look, Max, we crossed
the county line this mornin'.

953
01:30:04,458 --> 01:30:08,158
You're out of your jurisdiction.
Take off the muzzles, Solly.

954
01:30:08,459 --> 01:30:11,059
- Wait, Solly.
- You're wastin' time, Max.

955
01:30:11,260 --> 01:30:13,460
We're supposed to find 'em,
not execute 'em.

956
01:30:13,661 --> 01:30:16,661
I'm givin' the orders. Go ahead, Solly.

957
01:30:18,163 --> 01:30:22,463
Just a minute, Solly. If you make
one move, I'm goin' to shoot them.

958
01:30:23,165 --> 01:30:27,065
- For the love of Mike, Max !
- Are you gonna listen to me ?

959
01:30:29,868 --> 01:30:32,168
Hold everythin', Solly.

960
01:30:32,368 --> 01:30:34,368
Come on, boy.

961
01:30:35,269 --> 01:30:40,469
All right, I'll take those trackers. When
we close in, I'll go on ahead by myself.

962
01:30:40,771 --> 01:30:43,271
If anythin' happens to me,
let the other dogs loose.

963
01:30:43,472 --> 01:30:46,072
- I don't like it.
- You don't have to.

964
01:32:13,606 --> 01:32:15,506
Cullen ... Cullen ...

965
01:32:16,706 --> 01:32:18,506
Come on, Joker.

966
01:32:19,407 --> 01:32:22,907
- Cullen ...
- Run ! Come on !

967
01:32:23,609 --> 01:32:26,009
I can't make it ! I can't make it !

968
01:32:29,211 --> 01:32:30,311
Hold it, Joker.

969
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:23,530
How you doin', Joker ?

970
01:33:23,731 --> 01:33:25,331
OK.

971
01:33:28,032 --> 01:33:30,632
- You hurt bad ?
- I feel fine.

972
01:33:31,634 --> 01:33:33,634
Sure you do.

973
01:33:43,438 --> 01:33:46,938
You gonna make somebody
a fine old lady one day.

974
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:50,940
Ain't it the truth.

975
01:33:59,343 --> 01:34:01,343
Them the dogs ?

976
01:34:03,945 --> 01:34:05,845
Just rest easy, Joker.

977
01:34:08,147 --> 01:34:10,147
- Cullen ...
- Yeah ?

978
01:34:11,448 --> 01:34:14,648
We gave 'em a helluva
run for it, didn't we ?

979
01:34:15,049 --> 01:34:16,549
Yeah.

980
01:34:29,855 --> 01:34:31,755
Charlie Potatoes.

981
01:34:35,557 --> 01:34:38,157
I'm mashed potatoes now.

982
01:34:38,358 --> 01:34:40,358
So are you.

983
01:34:42,559 --> 01:34:44,559
We're doin' all right, Joker.

984
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:46,260
Yeah ...

985
01:34:55,064 --> 01:34:59,664
Long gone

986
01:35:03,167 --> 01:35:06,567
Ain't he lucky

987
01:35:10,169 --> 01:35:14,569
Long gone

988
01:35:17,771 --> 01:35:20,171
To Kentucky

989
01:35:21,474 --> 01:35:23,974
I left my home in Nashville

990
01:35:26,375 --> 01:35:28,375
Look a-here what I got

991
01:35:29,677 --> 01:35:32,277
Twenty long years on a chain gang

992
01:35:33,278 --> 01:35:35,278
Sweatin' and bustin' rock

993
01:35:36,779 --> 01:35:39,179
Judge he come from Memphis

994
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:42,180
Put me in the pen

995
01:35:42,781 --> 01:35:45,981
If I ever do see his face once more

996
01:35:46,282 --> 01:35:48,182
He never get home again

997
01:35:48,483 --> 01:35:50,683
That judge be long gone

998
01:35:51,184 --> 01:35:52,984
To Kentucky

999
01:35:53,186 --> 01:35:54,286
Long gone

1000
01:35:54,485 --> 01:35:56,085
Don't mean maybe

1001
01:35:56,386 --> 01:35:57,186
Long gone

1002
01:35:57,386 --> 01:35:58,586
What I mean

1003
01:35:58,788 --> 01:36:01,488
Long gone judge on a bowlin' green

1004
01:36:01,788 --> 01:36:03,788
Bowlin' green

1005
01:36:05,990 --> 01:36:07,990
Sewin' machine

1006
01:36:08,691 --> 01:36:10,291
A little kitten sittin'

1007
01:36:11,092 --> 01:36:12,992
On a sewin' machine

1008
01:36:13,893 --> 01:36:15,793
Sewin' machine

1009
01:36:16,894 --> 01:36:18,894
Sew so fast

1010
01:36:19,795 --> 01:36:21,795
Sew eleven stitches

1011
01:36:22,296 --> 01:36:25,396
