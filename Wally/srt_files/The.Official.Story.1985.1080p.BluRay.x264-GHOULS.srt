00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:44,125
THE OFFICIAL STORY

2
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:09,125
<i>Freedom, freedom, freedom!</i>

3
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:16,833
<i>Hear the sound of broken chains</i>

4
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:22,875
<i>See noble equality enthroned</i>

5
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:31,875
<i>Their worthy throne was unveiled</i>

6
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:38,125
<i>By the United Provinces of the South</i>

7
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:44,083
<i>- And the free ones of</i>...

8
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:53,417
To the great Argentine people, hail!

9
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:43,792
MARCH 14th 1983

10
00:05:57,792 --> 00:06:02,042
Gentleman, please.
Silence, please.

11
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:08,583
I'm Alicia Marbet Ibañez.
Some of you already know me.

12
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:13,792
This course studies
"Argentine History".

13
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:17,083
We will be covering

14
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:21,042
the social and political
institutions from 1810 forward.

15
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,542
We'll have three hours per week

16
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:25,500
which isn't much.

17
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:28,708
And let me warn you:

18
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,625
I don't like wasting my time.

19
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,125
I believe in discipline.

20
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,375
And I don't give away A's.

21
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,708
As some might recall, right?

22
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:47,875
Understanding history is preparation
for understanding the world.

23
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:51,667
No people can survive
without memory.

24
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:57,500
And History is the memory
of the people.

25
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,458
That's how we'll tackle
this course.

26
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:40,917
Here, madam!

27
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,625
Wait, use the towel.

28
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,708
I can put my head
under water, look.

29
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,583
No no no, don't!

30
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,750
You'll get water in your ears.

31
00:07:58,042 --> 00:08:02,083
I'm making a foam suit.
Do you bathe naked too, mommy?

32
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,125
Rinse off Gaby, or we'll
be here forever.

33
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,250
Sing, so I'll know you
haven't drowned.

34
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:10,417
OK!

35
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:15,625
<i>In the land of I don't remember</i>

36
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,917
<i>I take three steps and I'm lost</i>

37
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:29,750
<i>One step this way
I wonder if I may</i>

38
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:37,042
<i>One step over there</i>

39
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:43,375
<i>Oh, what a big scare</i>

40
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,458
I'm sorry Ma'am.

41
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,375
The train broke down again.

42
00:08:58,417 --> 00:09:01,083
- How's your sister?
- Fine.

43
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,542
How are you Gaby?

44
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,125
I'm fine.
Mommy cooked my meat.

45
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:10,583
I'm sure it tastes better
than mine.

46
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,250
Ma'am, Mrs. Luisa called
to remind you about

47
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:15,500
your high school reunion.

48
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:20,167
Cross out Rodrigo. Did you?

49
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:23,833
Not yet, he might still make
amends with Dolores.

50
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:28,917
He won't, he's already got
a new girlfriend. Cross him out!

51
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,500
Did you cross him out?

52
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:33,667
Dolores is lucky to have such
a devoted friend.

53
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:36,333
What does "divided" mean?

54
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:44,167
<i>It is regrettable how some
news media abuse their rights.</i>

55
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:50,458
<i>By preaching destabilization,
they encourage subversive ideas.</i>

56
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,583
- You're still here?
- Hi.

57
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't you have to get dressed?

58
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:01,375
A kiss?

59
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,375
Oh, you bought it.

60
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:07,375
It's beautiful!
Gaby will love it.

61
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:09,875
It's so real! Touch it!

62
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,625
What are you doing here?

63
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,208
Off to bed.

64
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:43,542
It was quite a scare!

65
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,000
My wife's afraid I'll get
a heart attack.

66
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:52,500
With these things you can't
neglect the smallest detail.

67
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:56,375
If you neglect details,
that's your problem, Macci.

68
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:58,583
I just did as I was told.

69
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,667
By whom?

70
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,667
Come on, Doctor! By you!

71
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,958
Ibañez and Dante
set it all up with my men.

72
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,583
We advised, Macci.
We're just consultants.

73
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,417
- We thought you couldn't make it.
- My apologies.

74
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,167
- What about Elvira?
- She's home grounded.

75
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:17,333
What's my friend being grounded for?
Or is it classified?

76
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,708
Oh, at home she calls the shots.
Just some liver trouble.

77
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,625
- Hello, Ibañez.
- Hello, General.

78
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,458
Your wife Miller?
Lost her already?

79
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,750
My maid's cousins were sent to
Tucuman or thereabout.

80
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:34,750
She wasn't even told
if they're dead or alive.

81
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:37,417
We lost the war a year ago!

82
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:40,625
We lost a battle,
not the war dear.

83
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,583
Don't tell me it's dragging on!

84
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:47,792
I was in Spain last week with
Ballesteros, a businessman

85
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,750
and a lifelong socialist.
Guess what he said?

86
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:53,000
"We were better off opposing Franco."

87
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:55,875
Now that they're Government

88
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:57,917
they don't know whom to blame.

89
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,167
It's useless! 25 years trying to
teach him that

90
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:04,708
talking business at the table is
bad manners and spoils digestion.

91
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,125
Who's talking business?

92
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:07,917
Politics, then. Far worse.

93
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,917
We women are to blame too,
for not steering the conversation.

94
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,458
Tell me about your baby boy Regina.
I've heard he's huge.

95
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,042
Oh, he's gorgeous.

96
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,750
He weighed 9 pounds at birth!

97
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:22,000
Unbelievable!
It must be the combined genetics.

98
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:25,458
Whom do you suspect Miller?

99
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,083
Oh no!

100
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:33,625
My mother was very tall. Actually...

101
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:45,125
How about you Roberto,
were you at your daughter's birth?

102
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:50,000
No, I'm more like your husband.
We're a different generation.

103
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:53,833
I think it's Alicia
who's from another generation.

104
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,792
You're rather old fashioned,
aren't you?

105
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,042
Yes, I am.

106
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:08,500
That child must be
four or five now, isn't she?

107
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:10,333
She'll be five soon.

108
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:21,083
You two are really quite different,
aren't you, Roberto?

109
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,458
Maybe that's the secret!

110
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,250
Yes, I imagine
it must be somewhere!

111
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
I think she's unbearable.

112
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:36,250
And she thinks you deserved
better than a barren woman.

113
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,750
You think Andrada never told her?
She totally knows!

114
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:43,625
Pretending an interest
in the American's kid.

115
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:46,583
"How about you Roberto,
were you at your daughter's birth?"

116
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,458
Oh, Alicia, you're blowing it
out of proportion.

117
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,458
What does she care if the stork
brought Gaby or the gypsies.

118
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,083
She doesn't!
But she knows I do!

119
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,292
She's just like her husband.

120
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,125
He always seems to imply

121
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:03,542
that anyone who disagrees
with him is out!

122
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,583
And since she can
only fire the maid,

123
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,458
she wrings our guts instead.

124
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,500
Did you notice?

125
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
She called the yank a cuckold,
Regina a bitch, you a sorry fellow,

126
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:20,333
the husband rude, me an idiot.
All in one sentence!

127
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,000
She picks on everyone except
the General.

128
00:14:24,042 --> 00:14:27,375
She does have her limits,
you must admit.

129
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:32,250
'The gaucho Moreira opens the door
ready for his last fight.

130
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,333
The officer and his soldiers

131
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:38,708
repel his violent onslaught bravely.

132
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:43,708
But, overcome by his brutal assault

133
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:50,083
they retreat into the corridors

134
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,208
through the back exits right & left.

135
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:58,542
A terrified Sergeant Chirino
hides behind the well.

136
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:03,750
Moreira, thinking he's alone,
attempts an escape.

137
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:06,375
Seeing him climb the fence,
the sergeant

138
00:15:06,417 --> 00:15:09,458
charges with his weapon.

139
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:15,083
Feeling the chill
of the bayonet in his back, Moreira.'

140
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,167
Bravo, Chirino!

141
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:24,417
Hang on! Moreira fires
his pistol at the sergeant.

142
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,208
Oh, sir, no!

143
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,833
Yes! He's only a cop!

144
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,542
'Moreira is badly wounded!

145
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,792
Vincenta enters
through the left.'

146
00:15:37,292 --> 00:15:38,708
Who plays Vincenta?

147
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:43,833
Cullen! Come on Cullen!

148
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:50,917
Cullen is a faggot!
Cullen is a faggot!

149
00:15:55,917 --> 00:15:58,667
"Make way, cowards!"

150
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,667
- You brute!
- Cowards.

151
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:05,250
"Seeing him, she flies to him,
collapsing with grief."

152
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:10,792
"A distant voice announces
his death sings these verses:

153
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,458
"I'm staking all my lucky

154
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,250
on my lasso, because a love
that is born Creole

155
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:22,375
is not repelled by death.

156
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:27,000
Because a weather-beaten
and sturdy gaucho."

157
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:35,792
Good morning.

158
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:50,375
Literature meets History.

159
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:12,000
Good morning, gentlemen.

160
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:14,375
Good morning, Professor.

161
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,167
You know Macarena's mother
can't leave kindergarten.

162
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,458
She says she has to stay
there all day.

163
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:33,792
Today, she wanted to leave
and Maqui wouldn't let her.

164
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:37,458
She clung at her leg,
crying and crying

165
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,083
I wouldn't miss it
for the world!

166
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,250
But you're never late!
How are you?

167
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:45,042
Oh, just this once
I have to leave early!

168
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:48,625
- You look gorgeous! Love the dress!
- Doesn't she look great?

169
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,167
The latest style.
You've lost weight!

170
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,208
Me? I started dieting
half an hour ago.

171
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,500
Still wearing your hair long.
How old-fashioned!

172
00:17:56,542 --> 00:18:00,042
You'll never guess
who sends you regards.

173
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,000
Anna?

174
00:18:11,917 --> 00:18:13,458
Yesterday

175
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,292
Tomorrow

176
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,667
I ran into her at the supermarket.

177
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,167
She looks like our grandmother.

178
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:49,458
Her skin's very fair and
thin skin wrinkles early.

179
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,750
That's not the problem.
She's been through so much.

180
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:55,625
Her son was sent to the Malvinas war.

181
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,500
Her last remaining son.

182
00:18:57,542 --> 00:18:58,833
What about the others?

183
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,458
The eldest married and left.

184
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,042
All her children
turned out subversive.

185
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,542
That's how she raised them.

186
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,000
How do you know
they were subversives?

187
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:12,292
Well they were taken,
surely for good reason!

188
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,917
- What are you talking about?
- Let's change the subject.

189
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:20,042
Anna, how's your son?

190
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:23,375
- He must be all grown up.
- He turned 17 in February.

191
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:26,708
Pablo is 17 years old?
My God, Anna, you're old!

192
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,833
Clara and I were pregnant
at the same time.

193
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,333
They called us the "captive globes".

194
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:36,583
Doesn't Clara ever come?

195
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,083
She went to Caracas 5 years ago.

196
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,875
Wasn't that when you left?

197
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:42,292
I left 7 years ago.

198
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,750
7? Really?

199
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:47,750
1976, shortly after
the military coup.

200
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,333
I am single.

201
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,750
Single, never.

202
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,792
Impossible. Nobody would tolerate.

203
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,000
You're back for good?

204
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:02,333
I don't know yet.

205
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:06,583
We can't all choose between
the tough caviar of exile and home.

206
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,500
So don't expect us to pity you.

207
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,333
I've thought a lot about you,
these years.

208
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,125
- Did you?
- I swear.

209
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,167
You were like an obsession.

210
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,750
And when I saw you,
it all came back to me.

211
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:23,583
Because you look the same.
Exactly the same.

212
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,792
After all these years.
After all those things

213
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,167
and you look exactly the same.

214
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:33,167
The same as when you
brown-nosed the monitor

215
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,250
and gave me
<i>2</i> silver salt-cellars

216
00:20:35,292 --> 00:20:38,042
when all I owned was a mattress.
The same.

217
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:40,542
So now, Dora

218
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,167
worthless schoolmate

219
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,292
unforgettable bitch,

220
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,500
why don't you go fuck yourself?

221
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,583
Why do you live
in such a far away country?

222
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,875
Do you have children?

223
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:02,417
One, but he's grown up.
He doesn't like bedtime stories.

224
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,708
My daughter's hair is ugly,
looks like a broom.

225
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,542
Will it grow if I cut it?

226
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,958
Enough chatter, lights out, Gaby.

227
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,792
Just a little longer.
One more story.

228
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,042
The one about the invisible paint.

229
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,583
The paint makes things invisible.

230
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:29,458
For instance, we paint
your bed and it vanishes.

231
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,583
So mommy will think
you're sleeping in mid-air.

232
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:36,208
Mommy, is she like Dolores?
Is she your "divided friend"?

233
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:43,292
That school building was hideous!
Clara used to call it "the jail".

234
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:45,625
That's right!

235
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,625
Like where you're
teaching now, right?

236
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:51,583
No, Roberto. Please, no.

237
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,958
It was built around the same time.
Bars on the windows, right?

238
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,875
That's true.
I hadn't realized.

239
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,375
Gaby is adorable.

240
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,542
She says
I'm the "divided" friend.

241
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:28,958
She can't pronounce devoted.

242
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:33,417
She loves the word,
she's wearing it out.

243
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,375
Are you staying?

244
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,000
I don't know yet.

245
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,625
You're looking good.

246
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,875
First time I see you in a skirt.

247
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:56,833
Europe did you good, didn't it?

248
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:03,000
It smoothed you around the edges.

249
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:08,417
"'Here I am in Caracas

250
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:11,667
18 pounds too fat
for a romantic victim,

251
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,042
so it dawned
on my 3 teenagers daughters that

252
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,333
between them and freedom

253
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:19,292
stood their idiot mother

254
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:23,542
starving myself and running
3 miles a day

255
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,167
around my tiny bed!'

256
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:31,875
Only to become a fit fatty
without a man in sight."

257
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:46,208
"Forty years old!

258
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:55,833
How did I get here
without realising?"

259
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,250
The fatty!

260
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,333
Well, we're just peachy!

261
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:12,917
At fatty's we used
to drink eggnog.

262
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:24,708
I got sick.
Did I tell you?

263
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,875
No, I didn't.

264
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:30,917
The day I turned 40, Roberto
took me to a fancy restaurant.

265
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:33,917
Very expensive.
And I...

266
00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:38,417
I got food poisoning!

267
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:43,208
3 days in bed!

268
00:24:44,542 --> 00:24:49,375
Christ, 3 days in bed!
The doctor came. Never felt so ill.

269
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:52,833
You and Roberto are OK?

270
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:54,625
Yes.

271
00:24:57,375 --> 00:25:02,167
Then everything's fine.
It's nice to come back to this.

272
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,500
Why didn't you tell me
you were leaving?

273
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:08,833
Not even a note.

274
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:11,625
I didn't exactly have time
to throw going-away parties.

275
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:14,000
Why such a hurry?

276
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:17,833
Should we get drunk on eggnog?

277
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:19,417
Disgusting!

278
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:22,708
Why won't you tell me?

279
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,125
Did you know my apartment
on Laprida Street?

280
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:39,583
I didn't.

281
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:43,292
There was a poster of Gardel
on the door.

282
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,500
They ripped it to pieces.

283
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:11,750
They stormed in,
threw a sweater over my head

284
00:26:11,792 --> 00:26:13,333
and trashed the place.

285
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,208
They took me in a car,
pushed me down with their feet.

286
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,750
They hit me with a rifle butt.

287
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:31,417
I woke up naked on a table,
they gave me shocks with a picana.

288
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,458
At some point someone
examined me with a stethoscope.

289
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,083
He told them to stop.

290
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:48,875
I'm not sure if it was that day.

291
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:54,333
I lost sense of time,

292
00:26:56,833 --> 00:26:59,708
something inside broke.

293
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,750
Something that can't be fixed.

294
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:10,750
I still wake up
in the morning gasping for air.

295
00:27:10,792 --> 00:27:16,167
I'm hanging there and they shove
my head into a pail of water.

296
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,917
After 7 years I still choke.

297
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,375
When I got out of there,

298
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:31,208
they said I'd been there for 36 days.

299
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,333
I had lost 27 pounds
and I'd undergone full treatment.

300
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:42,833
At first,

301
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:46,500
I was spared being raped.

302
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,292
You know why?

303
00:27:52,917 --> 00:27:55,500
Because the guy who came to my home,

304
00:27:55,917 --> 00:27:58,167
the only guy whose face I saw,

305
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:01,375
he smiled at me and said:

306
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,875
"I'm going to keep you for myself."

307
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,875
Later I would recognise his voice
every time he came around

308
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:15,167
asking if they'd kept me for him.

309
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:23,125
I'm terrified I'll hear his voice
on the street, in the subway.

310
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:26,958
But why?
Why did they do that to you?

311
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:29,375
Why?

312
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:35,292
I don't know.

313
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:39,000
At first they asked about Pedro.

314
00:28:41,042 --> 00:28:44,667
I told them the truth.
I hadn't seen him in 2 years.

315
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:46,167
And they'd ask again.

316
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:49,917
So I'd tell them again,
"Not in 2 years."

317
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:52,125
And again they asked.

318
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:59,083
Again I told them, and I got
electric prodding and drowning.

319
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:24,208
What had Pedro done?

320
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:27,917
Pedro was involved.

321
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:33,417
He might have been already dead
when they questioned me.

322
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:36,292
Did you report it?

323
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:44,917
What a good idea!
It had never occurred to me!

324
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:49,417
To whom would
I have reported it?

325
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:57,792
But you hadn't done anything.
What do you mean "to whom"?

326
00:29:57,833 --> 00:30:01,125
That place was crowded.

327
00:30:02,292 --> 00:30:06,625
Sometimes I didn't know if it was
me screaming or somebody else.

328
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:12,125
There were pregnant women
who lost their babies there.

329
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,625
And others were taken away,
but they returned alone.

330
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:19,458
Their babies went to families
who bought them,

331
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,708
no questions asked.

332
00:30:24,292 --> 00:30:26,083
Why are you telling me this?

333
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:42,583
I never told anyone.

334
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:49,167
I wrote about it once
for the commission.

335
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,417
Oddly,

336
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:11,792
I feel guilty.

337
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16,375
Ok, ok.

338
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:03,458
Gaby.

339
00:32:05,042 --> 00:32:06,417
You scared me!

340
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:10,708
Off to bed, let's go.

341
00:32:16,042 --> 00:32:21,042
Much of Moreno's work
exemplifies his republican spirit.

342
00:32:22,542 --> 00:32:25,958
For instance,
his decree for suppressing honours,

343
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,042
which he issued after December fifth

344
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:30,750
when an officer,
apparently wasted,

345
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,500
inebriated,

346
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,542
whose name I don't remember.

347
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:37,958
Never mind. Continue.

348
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:43,958
This officer...
The text book only says that he

349
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:46,500
"praised Saavedra excessively."

350
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:50,542
I think he called him
"Emperor" or something.

351
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:54,375
Anyhow, he gave him titles
that weren't democratic.

352
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:57,333
What does it say about honours?

353
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:01,625
They were suspended.

354
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:05,958
Of course.
Do you remember Moreno's words?

355
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:11,583
- Does anyone remember?
- I do, Ma'am.

356
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:18,208
He said that no members
of the Junta should have distinctions

357
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:21,583
other than the place
at which they happened to sit at.

358
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:25,500
He also says, in that document,
"no inhabitant of Buenos Aires

359
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:29,375
drunk or asleep, may speak
against his country's liberties."

360
00:33:29,417 --> 00:33:30,708
Very good, Duran.

361
00:33:33,417 --> 00:33:37,750
Can anybody else quote Moreno's
work that illustrates

362
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,917
his republican spirit?

363
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:40,500
I do!

364
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:43,167
Well I do.

365
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:46,667
Well...

366
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:49,583
There was this article
he wrote for "La Gaceta“

367
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:51,417
about the freedom of the press.

368
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:52,542
Your name?

369
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:54,000
Ferkovich.

370
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:56,833
Why don't you stand up
and tell us about it?

371
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,250
Oh, I can't really quote it.

372
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:03,042
I don't know it.

373
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,167
I don't know anything by heart.

374
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:09,125
My old man says
if I studied things by heart

375
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:11,208
I'd never learn anything.

376
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,167
A sensible man, your father.
Tell us in your own words.

377
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:20,833
If publishing the truth is forbidden

378
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:24,208
lies and poverty will triumph

379
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:31,125
and ignorance.
They didn't kill him just because.

380
00:34:31,167 --> 00:34:32,208
Whom?

381
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,500
Moreno. They didn't dump him
in the water just because.

382
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:40,292
It wasn't just because.

383
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:44,000
They had to throw people overboard
when they died offshore.

384
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:45,708
On long sea journeys,

385
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,750
they had no way
of preserving corpses.

386
00:34:49,042 --> 00:34:51,542
But Moreno was poisoned.

387
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,667
It isn't true?

388
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,792
Well that's a theory.

389
00:34:58,125 --> 00:34:59,417
Some people believe it.

390
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:01,708
But there's no proof.

391
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:05,708
There's no proof because
History's written by murderers!

392
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:14,625
I'm Horacio Costa.

393
00:35:16,542 --> 00:35:18,375
Mr. Costa, please step outside.

394
00:35:29,042 --> 00:35:31,792
This is a history class,
not a debate.

395
00:35:32,417 --> 00:35:35,333
Whoever wishes to talk
raise their hand for permission.

396
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:39,333
Without discipline there's
no teaching and no learning.

397
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,208
Are you a phony magician
or a real one?

398
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,667
A real magician.

399
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:49,750
Can't you see?
He's a real magician.

400
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:53,042
Are there cold Cokes, Rosa?

401
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:54,250
The fridge is bursting!

402
00:35:56,292 --> 00:35:57,875
And so am I!

403
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,250
If your mother-in-law doesn't
leave the kitchen, I'll quit!

404
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:04,375
You'll quit?

405
00:36:04,958 --> 00:36:07,542
Who'll put up with your cooking?

406
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,708
Where are the Cokes Alicia?

407
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:25,417
I bet my wise-ass brother
won't show up until it's over!

408
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:28,000
He's meeting
with some out-of-town people.

409
00:36:28,042 --> 00:36:30,333
Too bad you couldn't
convince your father.

410
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:33,583
Dad's stubborn.
He won't give in if Roberto doesn't.

411
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,292
Tell him Dad's dying to see Gaby.

412
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:40,042
Or does he meet out-of-town
people on Sundays, too?

413
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:42,625
Sometimes I think of Gaby's mother,
it scares me.

414
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,375
- Scared? Why?
- Ma'am, I quit!

415
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:48,000
Accept her resignation, Alicia,
before she changes her mind.

416
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,875
Now, like we did with the balloon?

417
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,000
Yes or no?

418
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:10,583
It happens to be
your daughter's birthday!

419
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,458
Nothing. It's fine.

420
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:16,958
Everything's fine.

421
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:31,625
Baby, are you sad?
Don't cry, my baby.

422
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:38,208
Let's go to bed.
You'll go to sleep. Won't you?

423
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:43,083
Sleep well. You want
your mommy to stay? Fine.

424
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:47,542
Don't cry any more.
Your mommy's here. See?

425
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:52,250
It's all right, my little one.
It's all right.

426
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:59,833
<i>My little one is sleepy.</i>

427
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:05,875
<i>Why is my little one sleepy?</i>

428
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:10,625
Because the sandman is here.

429
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:15,250
Look at those toys
your cousins brought you.

430
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:28,750
What happened, my love?

431
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:30,792
Did you hurt her?

432
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:32,333
What'd I tell you?

433
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:33,500
We didn't touch her.

434
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:35,250
We ran in and
she started screaming.

435
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:36,583
We didn't hurt her.

436
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,875
Remember our talk?

437
00:39:38,917 --> 00:39:41,708
She got scared.
We didn't see her.

438
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,792
What was?
She got crazy?

439
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:45,792
No, dad, please!

440
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:50,333
Can't she play,
isn't she big enough?

441
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:09,583
I can't believe
it's been five years.

442
00:40:10,917 --> 00:40:15,833
That day you came home very late.
Remember? Like today.

443
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:20,292
You didn't know how to hold her.

444
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,667
You carried her like a puppy.

445
00:40:28,833 --> 00:40:30,167
At the time,

446
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:33,125
I let you talk me out
of going to the hospital.

447
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:40,542
Now I think I shouldn't have.
I should have gone there.

448
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:41,917
Don't dear.

449
00:40:47,042 --> 00:40:50,042
Who was that woman in the car?

450
00:40:50,917 --> 00:40:52,292
Who was she?

451
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:53,583
A nurse.

452
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:58,208
What was the doctor's name, Haifel?

453
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:02,042
I can't remember.
Why should I remember?

454
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:04,500
The doctor who gave you Gaby,
and you forgot his name?

455
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:12,917
We agreed we'd never talk about it.

456
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,542
Did you pay them?

457
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:18,958
Alicia...

458
00:41:19,292 --> 00:41:20,500
The mother, or the doctor?

459
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:24,000
Why bring this up now?

460
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:28,250
Because you said she'd agreed.
How do you know for sure?

461
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,125
Did you see her at the hospital?

462
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,625
Answer me, Roberto.

463
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:40,000
Don't be angry.

464
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:45,708
Maybe she didn't even know
her child was being taken away.

465
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:50,458
What is it you're asking?

466
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:53,833
What the hell are you asking me?

467
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:57,292
How do I know what I'm asking?
I don't know.

468
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:02,042
I always feel wrong
on this particular day.

469
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:08,500
Won't we ever tell her the truth?

470
00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:16,875
You realize,
we celebrate our date, not hers.

471
00:42:16,917 --> 00:42:19,583
We celebrate the day
you brought her home.

472
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:22,083
We celebrate the registration day.

473
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:24,375
That's her birthday.

474
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:28,708
"Since conceived without freedom

475
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,333
the absurdities of our fathers,
ingrained by time and custom

476
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:35,667
will continue to be respected.

477
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:41,917
Let us for once break inertia
on our outdated opinions.

478
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:44,708
By forgetting our self love,
may we know the truth."

479
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:49,833
- Wait, idiot, let's see how it ends.
- Listen, Horacio!

480
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:53,750
“Truth, like virtue, contains
its own rewards.

481
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:57,208
Discussing and revealing it,
brings out its shining splendour."

482
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:00,708
"If restrictions are imp...

483
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:13,542
If speech is restricted,
the soul will vegetate like matter."

484
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:14,833
Sit down!

485
00:43:16,167 --> 00:43:18,958
"And the lies, the worries,
the bigotry and ignorance."

486
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,500
Artemi, pull that down!

487
00:43:20,792 --> 00:43:22,125
Take that down!

488
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,708
I won't ask who did it.

489
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:29,958
Because you all saw it!

490
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,250
"And ignorance."

491
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:36,292
So, you'll all paying
for the pranksters.

492
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:39,750
"Provoking division among people
and causing

493
00:43:39,792 --> 00:43:42,042
their continued abasement,
misery and ruin."

494
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:43,583
You'll know better next time.

495
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:47,833
"Mariano Moreno, La Gaceta
de Buenos Aires, June 12, 1810."

496
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,208
What if you decided
to be late for once?

497
00:43:51,958 --> 00:43:53,125
Why would I?

498
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:55,042
To have coffee with me,
for example.

499
00:43:55,792 --> 00:43:57,417
I'm sorry, Benitez,

500
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:59,792
I'm in a hurry.
I'm due downtown.

501
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:03,417
Can I hitch a ride?
I'd like to talk to you.

502
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,208
How about that coffee?

503
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:17,292
Not now, Benitez.
What do you want?

504
00:44:18,458 --> 00:44:20,500
A little fling, perhaps?

505
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:22,375
Are you insane?

506
00:44:22,792 --> 00:44:25,167
What a temper!
If I had

507
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:27,833
asked you to bed,
what a row you'd make!

508
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:28,833
What?

509
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:31,583
Oh, nothing of the sort.
Don't get your hopes up.

510
00:44:33,083 --> 00:44:35,042
I'm returning to you a report
you left

511
00:44:35,083 --> 00:44:37,000
in the principal's office.

512
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:39,500
It's about a student, Costa

513
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:42,583
who's talking nonsense
in class.

514
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:44,792
Why do you have it?

515
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:46,875
I'm friends with the secretary.

516
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:48,417
How dare you?

517
00:44:48,917 --> 00:44:50,250
You think you have the right...

518
00:44:50,292 --> 00:44:52,167
Oh I don't!
Not at all.

519
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:56,250
I took the file because
I know the score.

520
00:44:56,833 --> 00:44:59,125
Because his passion
could cost that idiot

521
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:01,125
more than detention.

522
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:04,583
And because you too
deserve another chance.

523
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:15,250
That class,
they're so impertinent.

524
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:18,917
Just today they covered
the blackboard with news clippings.

525
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:23,625
Frankly, I don't know
what they want. Here.

526
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:28,875
They want to inform you.

527
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:33,708
Why did Cuyo University fire you?

528
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:37,042
Because I'm dangerous.

529
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:40,875
I wasn't fired though.

530
00:45:41,625 --> 00:45:43,542
They payed a visit
in my absence,

531
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:46,042
and shredded every paper I had.

532
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:50,083
I got the message all by myself.

533
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,500
And these lists,

534
00:45:55,625 --> 00:45:58,375
with all the missing people,
even babies,

535
00:45:59,542 --> 00:46:00,958
could be true?

536
00:46:03,042 --> 00:46:05,292
I mean, it could be like with you:

537
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:07,000
New job.

538
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:11,208
Relocated. Right?

539
00:46:11,792 --> 00:46:13,875
What do you care
whether it's true.

540
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:16,250
How is it your problem?

541
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:23,375
<i>It will end. it will end.
This habit of killing.</i>

542
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:26,333
<i>It will end. It will end..</i>

543
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,750
It's always easier to believe
it's impossible, right?

544
00:46:29,792 --> 00:46:33,417
Because if it were possible
it would require complicity.

545
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:37,417
Of people who refuse to believe,
even as it stares them in the face.

546
00:46:39,625 --> 00:46:41,250
Here's Costa's report,

547
00:46:41,542 --> 00:46:43,583
in case you want
to file it again.

548
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:49,667
FAMILIES OF THOSE MISSING
FOR POLITICAL REASONS

549
00:46:49,958 --> 00:46:53,708
<i>Freedom, freedom, freedom!</i>

550
00:47:01,542 --> 00:47:05,458
<i>The missing.
Tell us where they are.</i>

551
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:14,542
<i>Tell us where those
kidnapped babies are!</i>

552
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:23,708
<i>You army bastards!</i>

553
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,333
<i>What have you done
with those missing?</i>

554
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:30,875
<i>The foreign debt and the corruption,</i>

555
00:47:31,375 --> 00:47:34,708
<i>are the worst shit
our nation has put up with!</i>

556
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:38,875
<i>And what about Malvinas?</i>

557
00:47:39,292 --> 00:47:42,500
<i>Those boys who never came back!</i>

558
00:47:43,167 --> 00:47:46,000
<i>We must not forget them..</i>

559
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:49,208
<i>That's why we must fight.</i>

560
00:48:02,667 --> 00:48:05,500
RETURN ALL CHILDREN
BORN IN CAPTIVITY

561
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:09,000
TO THE LEGITIMATE FAMILIES

562
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:12,542
THE GRANDMOTHERS
OF THE PLAZA DE MAYO

563
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:53,792
- Dante, please.
- Just a minute, Macci.

564
00:48:57,125 --> 00:49:00,125
Tell Ibañez it's ready, and
there's an extra 5% reimbursement.

565
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:01,250
I can't, now.

566
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:03,875
I think your figures are wrong.

567
00:49:04,917 --> 00:49:07,750
Get that old man out of here
or Andrada will kill us!

568
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:14,917
We're very busy today.

569
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:17,542
I didn't know you were here!
Wait for me inside.

570
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:20,583
No. Better make
an appointment for tomorrow.

571
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,542
What's the matter?

572
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:23,958
I wanted a word with you.

573
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,833
Remember I have to go?
We should be leaving.

574
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:29,250
I can't wait any longer,
and you know it!

575
00:49:29,292 --> 00:49:32,792
I must see Andrada.
I'm not going to jail!

576
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:37,250
Why would you go to jail?
What's wrong with you?

577
00:49:38,292 --> 00:49:39,833
Jail is for crooks.

578
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:42,542
This is a civilized country.
And you have friends.

579
00:49:42,583 --> 00:49:44,417
Let's see if Andrada can see you.

580
00:49:44,458 --> 00:49:47,625
What a fuss over a subpoena!

581
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:50,208
Coming with me to the airport?

582
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:52,917
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

583
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:56,958
I'll handle it.
Don't miss your flight. Call someone.

584
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,042
Whom?

585
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:02,417
Do we have the tickets?

586
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:05,167
Tell him we'll get even.

587
00:50:32,292 --> 00:50:34,583
You've been married for ages,
haven't you?

588
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:37,958
And you still come to see
him off. Touchy!

589
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,958
You're a teacher, aren't you?

590
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:43,583
I teach history.

591
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:48,625
It can't be easy teaching
history in high school nowadays.

592
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:52,417
Kids aren't what they used to be.

593
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:54,417
What do you think
of today's youth?

594
00:50:55,292 --> 00:50:56,958
Is there any hope?

595
00:50:58,708 --> 00:51:03,167
My nephew, he's 16 years old

596
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:05,292
and he doesn't believe
that San Martin crossed the Andes.

597
00:51:19,708 --> 00:51:23,625
I know it's silly, but don't go.
I'm afraid to be alone.

598
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:27,000
It's just a routine trip!
What's wrong?

599
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,667
Not now.

600
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:30,708
We'll talk when you come back.

601
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,125
Mr. Ibañez!

602
00:51:32,167 --> 00:51:36,250
I'd like to make a trip with you.
How about Bolivia.

603
00:51:36,833 --> 00:51:40,625
Let's go on a trip when you return.
We haven't traveled in ages.

604
00:51:42,417 --> 00:51:44,333
Take care of Gaby.
How was she?

605
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:47,042
Grumpy because you're going away.

606
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:48,875
Takes after her mother!

607
00:51:50,042 --> 00:51:52,667
After her mother?
God knows what that might be!

608
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:56,583
There you go again!
It's that, isn't it?

609
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:58,500
We'll miss our flight!

610
00:51:58,542 --> 00:52:00,208
I have to go!

611
00:52:00,792 --> 00:52:03,583
Stop thinking about it.
It's pointless. Stop thinking!

612
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:21,167
Mommy, there's a note in my notebook.
It says you need to

613
00:52:21,792 --> 00:52:25,792
buy me pencils, crayons
and an eraser. But no sharpener

614
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:28,333
because in a week they'd be

615
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:31,458
so so tiny so you
couldn't hold them.

616
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,792
Must I chase you
all over the place?

617
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:38,333
Are you sick?
Are you going to die?

618
00:52:38,375 --> 00:52:40,708
Come on.
Finish you dinner.

619
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:42,583
When is Daddy coming?

620
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:43,667
In a week.

621
00:52:43,708 --> 00:52:44,833
Like this?

622
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:47,292
Like this. The other hand. All five.

623
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:51,125
Day after, after, after tomorrow.

624
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:53,333
Gaby, let go of my face.
Eat your dinner.

625
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:56,167
Come on. Let's go eat.

626
00:53:02,167 --> 00:53:04,042
Eat! It's late.

627
00:53:04,667 --> 00:53:07,625
This meat has fat.
I'm not eating it.

628
00:53:07,667 --> 00:53:09,625
I cut off the fat.

629
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:33,042
BIRTH CERTIFICATE

630
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:36,500
How do they get meat from the cows?

631
00:53:36,542 --> 00:53:39,583
- First they kill them.
- Do they shoot them?

632
00:53:40,292 --> 00:53:41,667
Gaby, eat up.

633
00:53:42,042 --> 00:53:44,500
I get tired of chewing so much.

634
00:55:34,625 --> 00:55:36,583
DELIVERY ROOM

635
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:46,250
Dr. Jaifer. With a final "R".

636
00:56:46,708 --> 00:56:49,292
He left 3 years ago.

637
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:52,500
3 years?
Do you know where he is now?

638
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:55,042
No, I wouldn't know.

639
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:59,292
Try in the Admin Office,
they might know something.

640
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,167
Are you all right?

641
00:57:09,042 --> 00:57:11,042
<i>I was Gaby's age..</i>

642
00:57:11,958 --> 00:57:14,250
<i>I sat on
Grandma's rocking chair.</i>

643
00:57:14,792 --> 00:57:17,208
<i>I couldn't understand
what took them so long.</i>

644
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:20,542
<i>They were both killed
in a car accident.</i>

645
00:57:23,167 --> 00:57:26,708
Poor Grandma.
She made up this trip.

646
00:57:28,417 --> 00:57:30,167
She faked letters.

647
00:57:32,792 --> 00:57:36,417
For years I waited for them,
sitting there

648
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:39,333
in that rocking chair.

649
00:57:42,875 --> 00:57:43,875
I thought

650
00:57:46,333 --> 00:57:48,875
that Daddy and Mommy
had abandoned me.

651
00:57:52,625 --> 00:57:55,208
It wasn't until I grew up
and saw their grave

652
00:57:56,917 --> 00:57:58,792
that I started to forgive them.

653
00:58:05,083 --> 00:58:07,333
I was always so gullible.

654
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,292
But not now.

655
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:15,833
If I don't know who Gaby is.

656
00:58:16,875 --> 00:58:20,000
It's as if nothing is real.

657
00:58:22,542 --> 00:58:25,625
We weren't planning on
telling her she's adopted.

658
00:58:27,958 --> 00:58:31,000
Sometimes she asks
about her grandparents

659
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,208
and about their grandparents.
All the way back to God.

660
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:42,875
She says that God is "bionic".

661
00:58:46,917 --> 00:58:50,292
Because He can see us
although we can't see him.

662
00:58:51,167 --> 00:58:52,667
And it's true.

663
00:58:57,875 --> 00:58:59,792
I always thought

664
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:04,292
that her mother didn't want her.

665
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,292
But, now...

666
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:12,042
I never took anything
from anyone before.

667
00:59:12,708 --> 00:59:17,292
God trusted her to you, Alicia.
It is His will.

668
00:59:18,042 --> 00:59:20,958
Why do you doubt
His infinite wisdom?

669
00:59:22,167 --> 00:59:24,292
Do not offend the Lord.

670
00:59:26,083 --> 00:59:28,875
Do not reject what was given to you.

671
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:32,167
I don't reject her!

672
00:59:32,208 --> 00:59:34,958
You've shown piety
and compassion.

673
00:59:35,375 --> 00:59:39,833
You've protected her from evil
and the dangers ahead of her.

674
00:59:40,542 --> 00:59:41,833
What dangers?

675
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,167
You know the truth, Father!
Won't you tell me?

676
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:47,875
You have not sinned

677
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,708
but your covenant with
the Lord has been damaged.

678
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:53,625
You can help me, Father.

679
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:57,750
"I shall not destroy the cities

680
00:59:57,792 --> 00:59:59,750
for the sake of righteous men.“

681
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:05,208
Father, you know everything
that happened. Right?

682
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:08,167
God merciful father
that it reconciled

683
01:00:08,208 --> 01:00:11,917
Tell me the truth, Father!
You know.

684
01:00:13,167 --> 01:00:15,875
You have to tell me the truth!

685
01:00:17,042 --> 01:00:20,625
You were with Roberto
that day weren't you, Father?

686
01:00:21,458 --> 01:00:23,333
I absolve you of your sins.

687
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:26,542
I don't need absolution!
I need the truth!

688
01:00:31,333 --> 01:00:35,042
Thank the Lord
because He is good.

689
01:00:36,042 --> 01:00:37,750
His mercy is eternal.

690
01:00:40,917 --> 01:00:43,625
The Lord has forgiven your sins.

691
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:46,667
Go in peace.

692
01:01:25,792 --> 01:01:29,417
Alicia, Rosa took her home.
Gaby had a slight fever.

693
01:01:29,458 --> 01:01:30,583
We called you several times.

694
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:32,875
You may dress her now.

695
01:01:32,917 --> 01:01:35,000
No!
I can dress myself!

696
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:39,708
Of course you can, young lady!

697
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:42,833
My mistake, thinking I was
talking to a little girl.

698
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:48,083
What does it say here, Doctor?

699
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,167
"Ortolani sign."

700
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:53,417
The luxation of the hip
she was born with.

701
01:01:53,458 --> 01:01:55,542
You remember we spoke about it?

702
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:58,042
Bring her when she's actually ill.

703
01:01:58,083 --> 01:02:00,708
And stop throwing away your money.

704
01:02:02,667 --> 01:02:06,625
You told me it was likely
that she was

705
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:11,042
a firstborn, because
of this ortolani sign. Right?

706
01:02:11,458 --> 01:02:12,958
Yes. It's possible.

707
01:02:16,917 --> 01:02:19,583
And that the date of birth

708
01:02:19,625 --> 01:02:23,083
could be determined according to
the day the umbilical cord fell off.

709
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:33,875
These facts are generally noted.

710
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:39,833
The weight, height, etc.,
are also in the records. Right?

711
01:02:40,917 --> 01:02:42,500
Cullen!

712
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:45,333
Cullen, the answer.

713
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:49,208
The second one.

714
01:03:29,625 --> 01:03:33,583
Marcelo almost smuggled me
into this job.

715
01:03:33,625 --> 01:03:35,167
Leave me alone!

716
01:03:35,792 --> 01:03:38,000
Is Roberto coming back on Saturday?

717
01:03:38,625 --> 01:03:42,208
Plus you didn't come here
to discuss your husband, right?

718
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:44,583
Gaby is adopted.

719
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:47,167
Remember how you spoke
of babies that were given

720
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:48,833
to families, no questions asked.

721
01:03:48,875 --> 01:03:51,500
I couldn't have children.
I had every treatment there was.

722
01:03:51,542 --> 01:03:53,625
Then this opportunity
came through Roberto's office.

723
01:03:53,667 --> 01:03:56,750
I asked no questions.
And now, I don't know whom to ask.

724
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:59,625
Roberto won't tell me a thing.

725
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:01,750
But I'm getting stuff together.

726
01:04:01,792 --> 01:04:03,667
I found out the hospital
where she was born.

727
01:04:04,375 --> 01:04:07,458
I know the approximate date,
her weight and height.

728
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,875
I know she had
a type of hip dislocation here.

729
01:04:10,917 --> 01:04:12,958
You're going to help me, Anita.

730
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,833
Come with me to the hospital.

731
01:04:16,208 --> 01:04:20,292
Remember how we always went
everywhere together. Even to pee!

732
01:04:37,667 --> 01:04:39,542
Please go back to the archives.

733
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:41,917
They sent me here.
You send me back there!

734
01:04:45,542 --> 01:04:46,750
Excuse me, ma'am.

735
01:04:47,167 --> 01:04:50,167
But you're the one
who sent me to the archives.

736
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:53,208
They say that you must have it.

737
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:56,375
I told you we don't have
the 1978 records.

738
01:04:59,667 --> 01:05:02,708
Ma'am, those are this year's records.

739
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,792
Not much help, dear?

740
01:05:23,125 --> 01:05:26,833
It's sad when one has to add bad
service to one's troubles, right?

741
01:05:28,708 --> 01:05:31,042
I'm also looking for my family.

742
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,333
Maybe we can help each other?

743
01:05:33,375 --> 01:05:34,708
No. It's not that.

744
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,708
Aren't you looking for a baby?

745
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,458
Yes.

746
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:47,875
Lamb of God, who takes away
the sins of the world.

747
01:05:48,208 --> 01:05:50,458
Be merciful on us.

748
01:05:50,792 --> 01:05:54,625
Lamb of God, who takes
away the sins of the world.

749
01:05:54,667 --> 01:05:57,708
Have mercy upon us.

750
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:01,458
Lamb of God, who takes away
the sins of the world.

751
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,625
Grant us peace.

752
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:10,375
Poverty is not shameful.

753
01:06:10,958 --> 01:06:14,750
Just as wealth is not an honor.

754
01:06:14,792 --> 01:06:16,333
But it's better to be rich.

755
01:06:16,375 --> 01:06:20,833
That depends
on what you had to do to get there

756
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,500
and what you're willing
to do to keep it up.

757
01:06:24,542 --> 01:06:26,625
All right,
but if you don't steal.

758
01:06:27,292 --> 01:06:31,750
The thieves on TV aren't
the only kind, you know.

759
01:06:32,333 --> 01:06:34,458
So you'd rather be poor, Grandpa?

760
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:36,917
I can't help it.

761
01:06:37,208 --> 01:06:41,667
But I do like having
a clean conscience.

762
01:06:45,917 --> 01:06:47,542
A vermouth, for old time's sake?

763
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:51,250
My dear sister-in-law,

764
01:06:51,292 --> 01:06:53,500
you're not hitting on me,
are you?

765
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:58,292
You must get plenty of offers.

766
01:06:59,917 --> 01:07:01,458
With my looks!

767
01:07:02,208 --> 01:07:03,708
You know how women fall

768
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:08,375
head-over-heals over a starving
widower with a broke factory

769
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:11,250
and 3 kids, forced to go back

770
01:07:11,292 --> 01:07:13,208
to living with his folks.

771
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,875
My picture's on the cover
of the top magazines!

772
01:07:16,917 --> 01:07:18,792
"Most Eligible Man of the Year."

773
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,500
OK. Name one woman who's
ever refused you.

774
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,958
You're kidding!
But I'm cautious.

775
01:07:30,083 --> 01:07:31,750
I never dive into an empty pool.

776
01:07:32,417 --> 01:07:34,875
Still, there was one
who rejected me.

777
01:07:35,667 --> 01:07:36,958
Cecilia rejected me.

778
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:39,792
I jumped in twice.

779
01:07:40,083 --> 01:07:43,000
Twice she said no.
But finally, she couldn't resist.

780
01:07:52,542 --> 01:07:55,375
Roberto, how could you?

781
01:07:56,208 --> 01:07:59,000
I scold the kids for teasing animals!

782
01:08:06,417 --> 01:08:10,583
- Did you use the washing machine?
- Yes, son. Thank you.

783
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:12,500
Oh, Mom.

784
01:08:13,917 --> 01:08:15,500
Don't be mad.

785
01:08:15,542 --> 01:08:18,208
It's just that I'm grateful
every time I use it.

786
01:08:18,792 --> 01:08:21,333
I'm so happy that you came.

787
01:08:21,667 --> 01:08:23,125
But you have to promise me...

788
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:25,958
Why me? Why don't you
make them promise?

789
01:08:26,333 --> 01:08:28,208
That's between me and them.

790
01:08:29,333 --> 01:08:31,875
Have you read those things
on the paper lately?

791
01:08:31,917 --> 01:08:33,792
Those announcements?

792
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:38,000
They say there are missing babies.

793
01:08:38,708 --> 01:08:40,167
So, what about it?

794
01:08:41,375 --> 01:08:42,917
Has anyone said anything?

795
01:08:42,958 --> 01:08:44,625
No. Nobody said anything.

796
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:47,542
- But there's a chance.
- A chance!

797
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,167
Just think.

798
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,958
Mother! Let's eat?

799
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,750
Your dad and your brother

800
01:08:56,792 --> 01:08:59,250
are well liked in the neighbourhood.

801
01:08:59,667 --> 01:09:01,792
They're highly respected.

802
01:09:01,833 --> 01:09:03,417
I know.

803
01:09:03,875 --> 01:09:05,625
Did you talk to Roberto?

804
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,667
Maybe Roberto doesn't know either.

805
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:16,708
See, it's warm enough
to eat on the patio.

806
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:20,875
You were right, son.
But the radio predicted bad weather.

807
01:09:20,917 --> 01:09:22,417
The clouds scared me.

808
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:27,042
There's no teaching your mother.
She believes anything they say.

809
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:31,792
When have we been wrong
about the weather, my son and I?

810
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:34,375
And by your "son" you mean
Enrique, right?

811
01:09:34,417 --> 01:09:38,833
It's a habit. He lives here.
And, come to think of it...

812
01:09:40,375 --> 01:09:44,542
When have you ever look up
at the sky to forecast?

813
01:09:44,583 --> 01:09:47,333
Only if it's raining dollars!

814
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:50,000
Let it rain dollars!

815
01:09:50,417 --> 01:09:51,792
Another helping?

816
01:09:54,083 --> 01:09:58,125
I can't win!
They work me up every time.

817
01:09:58,458 --> 01:10:00,292
Roberto, your Mom's talking.

818
01:10:00,333 --> 01:10:02,458
You, Mom, even Gaby.

819
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:07,792
They work me up
until I take the bait!

820
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:11,167
I made it with prawns,
just the way you like it.

821
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:15,708
Let's see, how it started
this time. Right, the weather!

822
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:19,042
Even Mom took the bait
with the weather.

823
01:10:19,083 --> 01:10:20,417
Kids, 90 play!

824
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:25,375
Why the hell do you ask us over?

825
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:30,458
Go play in the backyard. Go on!

826
01:10:32,917 --> 01:10:34,958
Dad, he has a point this time.

827
01:10:35,375 --> 01:10:36,750
Listen, Enrique.

828
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:40,000
You can stick your defence
right up your ass!

829
01:10:40,042 --> 01:10:41,417
You understand?

830
01:10:41,833 --> 01:10:43,167
Can I say something?

831
01:10:43,208 --> 01:10:46,667
Go on! Go and stare at the clouds
with Daddy and calculate the winds.

832
01:10:46,958 --> 01:10:48,333
Can I say something?

833
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:49,667
Yes, talk!

834
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:53,208
It was a bad joke, in poor taste.

835
01:10:53,792 --> 01:10:55,750
But it was just a joke!

836
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:59,792
Can't one make a joke
about one's son?

837
01:10:59,833 --> 01:11:02,708
- Just hilarious, Dad!
- I'm talking!

838
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:07,375
I'm your father,
I raised you better than this.

839
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:11,833
Your brother's too fond of wine.

840
01:11:11,875 --> 01:11:15,542
And you...
You're too fond of money.

841
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:18,542
But your brother never gets drunk.

842
01:11:18,583 --> 01:11:21,500
He prefers other things to wine.

843
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,792
And you...

844
01:11:25,125 --> 01:11:27,708
We'd probably get along
better if you were a drunk.

845
01:11:28,167 --> 01:11:33,375
Of course, you'd love me
dearly if I were a failure.

846
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:39,417
The whole country's collapsed,
everybody went down except

847
01:11:39,833 --> 01:11:41,542
the sons of bitches,

848
01:11:42,542 --> 01:11:43,792
the thieves,

849
01:11:44,958 --> 01:11:49,583
they hit the jackpot!

850
01:11:53,667 --> 01:11:56,042
And you'll die believing that.
Won't you?

851
01:11:58,792 --> 01:12:01,875
You'll never admit
that you're a spectacular failure!

852
01:12:02,708 --> 01:12:04,583
You and your kind!

853
01:12:06,792 --> 01:12:09,667
What's going on?
Roberto, please!

854
01:12:09,708 --> 01:12:12,750
You continue to use
40-year-old machinery.

855
01:12:13,417 --> 01:12:15,458
The world moves on, you know!

856
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,917
And it crushes those
who stop to stare at the clouds!

857
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:20,417
How dare you blabber
on such immoral bullshit

858
01:12:20,458 --> 01:12:21,542
while people are starving?

859
01:12:22,042 --> 01:12:24,083
Starving? Who's starving here?

860
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,875
Who the hell is starving?
Tell me!

861
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:30,375
You continue to stuff your mouth

862
01:12:30,917 --> 01:12:33,000
with high-flown words,

863
01:12:33,042 --> 01:12:35,000
reciting old anarchist bullshit!

864
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:39,375
The Spanish Civil War is over.
And you lost it!

865
01:12:39,417 --> 01:12:40,958
You lost it!

866
01:12:41,792 --> 01:12:45,458
You want me to feel guilty
because I'm not a loser.

867
01:12:45,833 --> 01:12:48,125
Oh, no, no! I'm not a loser.

868
01:12:48,167 --> 01:12:51,417
Get that into your heads!
I'm not a loser!

869
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,333
And this other war?

870
01:13:01,292 --> 01:13:03,792
The war you and your bunch won.

871
01:13:05,792 --> 01:13:09,625
Do you know who lost it,
brother? The kids.

872
01:13:11,333 --> 01:13:12,792
Kids like mine.

873
01:13:14,167 --> 01:13:17,333
They'll be paying
for the dollars that were nicked.

874
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:20,500
And they'll repay them
by not eating and not studying.

875
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:27,833
Because you certainly won't.
Hell no! Why should you?

876
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:30,167
You're not a loser!

877
01:14:01,708 --> 01:14:04,583
MURDERED IN THE WOMB

878
01:14:14,667 --> 01:14:16,417
FOUND MURDERED

879
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:22,708
Wait. There's something here.

880
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:25,458
Between March 15 and 20. Right?

881
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:26,792
More or less.

882
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:32,417
Although the girl is younger.

883
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:34,083
You're sure it's that hospital?

884
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:35,583
In La Plata.

885
01:14:39,667 --> 01:14:43,208
And the anatomy data,
size of skull, thorax

886
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:46,542
they should all be
in the hospital's archives, right?

887
01:14:46,583 --> 01:14:49,667
Well, no.
But we don't have that data.

888
01:14:49,708 --> 01:14:52,083
Even if we did, it wouldn't help.

889
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:54,583
We've nothing to compare with.

890
01:14:58,583 --> 01:15:00,917
Or do you have something
to compare them against?

891
01:15:01,833 --> 01:15:03,125
No.

892
01:15:14,833 --> 01:15:17,583
Patience, gentlemen.
It won't be long now.

893
01:15:17,625 --> 01:15:18,708
A drink, Dante?

894
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:19,750
Yes, why not?

895
01:15:19,792 --> 01:15:23,167
Not me. I need a steady
hand to beat this guy.

896
01:15:23,208 --> 01:15:25,583
May I use the phone?

897
01:15:25,917 --> 01:15:29,167
How is Andrada supposed
to telephone if you're using it?

898
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:32,083
- Just a quick call.
- Go ahead, use it!

899
01:15:32,458 --> 01:15:34,083
Andrada won't call, anyway.

900
01:15:34,125 --> 01:15:36,417
He says "Gelby"
instead of Gaby!

901
01:15:36,458 --> 01:15:37,875
So teach him!

902
01:15:38,375 --> 01:15:41,083
Mommy will kill us if you're
not in bed soon!

903
01:15:41,125 --> 01:15:43,292
Why isn't she home yet?

904
01:15:43,333 --> 01:15:47,208
- Can I wait up for her?
- Just a while.

905
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:49,375
Then I'll eat all your food.

906
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:51,833
But you already ate!

907
01:15:51,875 --> 01:15:54,958
This food isn't for little girls.

908
01:15:56,083 --> 01:16:00,083
Daddy, men don't cook.
Women do.

909
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:02,208
Did you take your medicine?

910
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:05,625
One more, General, and it's over!

911
01:16:06,042 --> 01:16:07,542
It seems you're winning.

912
01:16:07,583 --> 01:16:09,167
Who plays to lose?

913
01:16:09,208 --> 01:16:12,250
I like to see him enjoy it.

914
01:16:12,292 --> 01:16:13,417
Give me a kiss.

915
01:16:14,333 --> 01:16:16,708
Your mother seems
to have abandoned us.

916
01:16:17,042 --> 01:16:19,208
Truth is I can't get worked up
about cards any more.

917
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:20,750
Too much going on.

918
01:16:23,458 --> 01:16:25,583
Get off the phone.

919
01:16:26,292 --> 01:16:28,417
She's not picking up.

920
01:16:29,667 --> 01:16:32,625
I think I'll have to leave.

921
01:16:35,292 --> 01:16:39,750
At noon she took the boy to her
mother's and hasn't returned.

922
01:16:39,792 --> 01:16:42,708
Be patient, Argentine women
are one of a kind.

923
01:16:45,458 --> 01:16:48,792
Rosa, turn the heat down
and keep stirring.

924
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,750
I can smell the gravy
setting from here.

925
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:56,292
That's the secret the nose.

926
01:16:56,333 --> 01:16:59,792
All I know how to cook
is a barbecue.

927
01:16:59,833 --> 01:17:02,167
That's all they ever teach us
in the country.

928
01:17:02,208 --> 01:17:04,583
I can't picture my dad
making gravy.

929
01:17:04,625 --> 01:17:06,833
If I did only
as my father did before me...

930
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:08,042
My daddy!

931
01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:10,167
How would there be
any progress?

932
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:13,333
I for one wouldn't be sitting
on the Board of Directors!

933
01:17:24,708 --> 01:17:27,042
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were celebrating.

934
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:30,792
Celebrating what?

935
01:17:32,417 --> 01:17:34,250
There's nothing to celebrate.

936
01:17:35,042 --> 01:17:36,500
Something came up.

937
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:39,667
I'll tell you later.

938
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:45,208
I think Andrada
will hang us out to dry.

939
01:17:47,542 --> 01:17:51,333
All of us, except the Yank,
who's probably his partner.

940
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:55,375
What? I don't understand.
What happened?

941
01:17:56,625 --> 01:18:01,000
That's what I'm wondering.
What's up with your hair lately?

942
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:25,708
"This counter-revolutionary
persecution

943
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:27,750
contrary to the ideals of May

944
01:18:27,792 --> 01:18:29,750
was aimed at exterminating
the patriots

945
01:18:30,042 --> 01:18:32,417
who tried to extend
throughout America

946
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:35,708
the influence of the
liberation of the Rio de la Plata

947
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:40,042
like a knife-bearing arm
that struck Monteagudo's back

948
01:18:40,083 --> 01:18:44,458
and sliced Castelli's tongue
to silence him.

949
01:18:44,875 --> 01:18:48,250
The ensuing battle between
Unitarians and Federalists."

950
01:18:48,292 --> 01:18:51,417
Mr. Costa, what is it you
say here about Castelli?

951
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:58,583
They cut his tongue
in jail, so he wouldn't talk.

952
01:19:00,708 --> 01:19:02,250
What is your reference?

953
01:19:02,875 --> 01:19:04,250
What do you mean?

954
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:09,833
In what book did you read that?

955
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:12,458
You only believe
what's written in books?

956
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:18,875
For events that happened over
150 years ago it seems wise

957
01:19:18,917 --> 01:19:22,125
to refer to existing documentation.

958
01:19:23,667 --> 01:19:28,125
Seriously, Costa.
The protagonists are dead!

959
01:19:29,292 --> 01:19:33,042
Moreno and Saavedra, Monteagudo
and Pueyrredón, Dorrego and Lavalle

960
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:39,083
Rosas and Mitre, and poor Castelli,
not only mute, but dead!

961
01:19:40,583 --> 01:19:44,250
Therefore, unless you're some
sort of medium,

962
01:19:45,042 --> 01:19:49,708
I'll ask you to supply
literary references, since you're

963
01:19:50,667 --> 01:19:52,625
so passionate
about historical research.

964
01:19:52,667 --> 01:19:54,417
That's an A minus.

965
01:20:31,458 --> 01:20:34,208
- Hello.
- Hi, how are you doing?

966
01:20:40,542 --> 01:20:42,583
I like your hair down.

967
01:20:42,625 --> 01:20:43,542
I look kind of Wild.

968
01:20:44,667 --> 01:20:46,750
Then I'm partial to wild ladies.

969
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,667
You're all over the place.

970
01:21:00,083 --> 01:21:02,083
I played against myself and won.

971
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:13,042
So?

972
01:21:13,375 --> 01:21:14,375
So what?

973
01:21:14,667 --> 01:21:18,417
Are your students
still raising hell?

974
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:19,583
Of course.

975
01:21:22,167 --> 01:21:24,792
Well, you keep
throwing burning matches...

976
01:21:25,125 --> 01:21:28,417
it makes sense to expect
explosions around you.

977
01:21:29,625 --> 01:21:31,917
Explosions all around, exactly.

978
01:21:33,625 --> 01:21:34,958
What's happened?

979
01:21:36,292 --> 01:21:38,667
Everything seems
to be falling apart.

980
01:21:39,625 --> 01:21:42,333
It is!
It's all falling apart.

981
01:21:43,583 --> 01:21:44,583
Yes?

982
01:21:46,417 --> 01:21:47,833
But not everything.

983
01:21:49,167 --> 01:21:51,458
Let's not get our hopes
up too high.

984
01:21:53,042 --> 01:21:57,375
Although you people are
ready to swallow the bait.

985
01:21:59,125 --> 01:22:00,167
Tea perhaps.

986
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:03,542
And this is just the beginning.

987
01:22:04,083 --> 01:22:05,792
Much to your people's regret.

988
01:22:06,375 --> 01:22:07,458
No.

989
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:12,667
Benitez, who are "you people"?

990
01:22:16,292 --> 01:22:20,208
There's nothing more touching
than a guilty bourgeois lady.

991
01:22:28,542 --> 01:22:30,583
To quote an old dear friend of mine:

992
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:35,833
Why don't you go fuck
yourself a little?

993
01:22:40,458 --> 01:22:43,750
Julieta's mommy says to call
her to arrange a playdate.

994
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:51,667
I don't want to go.
She made fun of Macarena.

995
01:22:51,708 --> 01:22:53,083
Oh, why?

996
01:22:53,875 --> 01:22:57,792
- They were so stupid!
- "Baby! Baby!"

997
01:23:04,292 --> 01:23:08,208
But we stood up for her,
Teresa, Diana and me.

998
01:24:23,333 --> 01:24:25,333
We don't see each other much.

999
01:24:32,042 --> 01:24:33,583
Oh, damn it!

1000
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:39,792
That stupid Rosa keeps
rearranging the furniture!

1001
01:24:42,583 --> 01:24:44,875
Aren't you drinking
too much lately?

1002
01:24:45,667 --> 01:24:49,333
A blind man wouldn't last
two days in this house!

1003
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,458
How nice, how nice.

1004
01:25:09,542 --> 01:25:11,292
Today I called at 8 o'clock

1005
01:25:12,833 --> 01:25:16,250
Rosa said you dropped Gaby
and went out again.

1006
01:25:19,042 --> 01:25:20,750
What are you up to?

1007
01:25:25,042 --> 01:25:26,292
I'm scared.

1008
01:25:28,625 --> 01:25:29,917
Scared of what?

1009
01:25:33,625 --> 01:25:35,583
If I ask, will you answer me?

1010
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:42,167
Could Gaby be
a missing mother's child?

1011
01:25:45,042 --> 01:25:48,458
Where do you get these ideas?

1012
01:25:52,833 --> 01:25:56,083
What a silly idiot I am! Of course!

1013
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:02,458
The moment I saw her,
I knew we were headed for trouble!

1014
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:04,333
Anna has nothing to do with it.

1015
01:26:04,375 --> 01:26:06,250
It's all over the newspapers!

1016
01:26:07,792 --> 01:26:09,833
She lived with a subversive!

1017
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:16,292
I don't understand
how she managed to come back

1018
01:26:17,875 --> 01:26:20,375
and go about her business freely.

1019
01:26:21,292 --> 01:26:23,500
Who lived with a subversive?

1020
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:26,125
Why do you think she left?

1021
01:26:26,167 --> 01:26:27,208
Why?

1022
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:29,292
You knew who Pedro was?

1023
01:26:29,333 --> 01:26:30,625
No. I didn't know.

1024
01:26:31,583 --> 01:26:34,917
She told me that they'd been
separated the last 4 years.

1025
01:26:34,958 --> 01:26:37,833
She hadn't seen him for <i>2</i> to years
when they took him.

1026
01:26:37,875 --> 01:26:39,750
Of course she'd say that!

1027
01:26:41,667 --> 01:26:43,542
And you knew about it?

1028
01:26:47,083 --> 01:26:48,500
You knew?

1029
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,583
How come you knew?

1030
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:57,875
What do I know, Alicia!
I must have heard it from you.

1031
01:27:21,375 --> 01:27:22,417
Are you angry?

1032
01:27:23,042 --> 01:27:24,917
No, my love, I'm not angry.

1033
01:27:27,375 --> 01:27:30,125
Rosa can't braid my hair,
but you can.

1034
01:27:30,958 --> 01:27:34,667
That's because when I was
your age I wore pigtails too.

1035
01:28:37,083 --> 01:28:39,542
I don't know who took that one.

1036
01:28:40,917 --> 01:28:42,708
Probably the old man.

1037
01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:46,583
Look at the crystal clear water
in that stream.

1038
01:28:47,292 --> 01:28:50,250
You can see his foot
clearly under the water.

1039
01:28:52,083 --> 01:28:54,708
He looks skinny, but he was strong.

1040
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,583
She could read already. Look.

1041
01:29:00,875 --> 01:29:03,125
They were barely 5 years old.

1042
01:29:06,792 --> 01:29:09,167
See the tiny scar on her cheek?

1043
01:29:11,417 --> 01:29:14,500
Yes. Unless you knew,
it looks like a smudge.

1044
01:29:16,292 --> 01:29:18,042
They were playing with the Diaz boys.

1045
01:29:19,125 --> 01:29:22,333
They weren't used
to playing with girls.

1046
01:29:23,208 --> 01:29:25,625
So when the old man wasn't looking,

1047
01:29:25,667 --> 01:29:27,500
they threw a rock at her.

1048
01:29:28,167 --> 01:29:32,000
It bled a lot but she didn't cry.

1049
01:29:33,667 --> 01:29:37,958
And he threw the 4 Diaz
boys into the water. All 4!

1050
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:43,750
He fought with them, head-on.
That's how he fought.

1051
01:29:46,333 --> 01:29:51,250
Then he sat down next to her
to keep her company.

1052
01:29:53,458 --> 01:29:55,125
They had never met before.

1053
01:29:55,792 --> 01:29:57,208
But after this,

1054
01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:00,917
nobody could separate them.

1055
01:30:02,167 --> 01:30:03,458
Nobody.

1056
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:07,833
Braulio took this photo.

1057
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:12,958
It was his birthday
and they gave him a camera.

1058
01:30:13,917 --> 01:30:17,167
He took pictures of everything.

1059
01:30:17,208 --> 01:30:21,208
He shot the whole roll,
sneaking up on you with the camera.

1060
01:30:24,375 --> 01:30:26,875
She still wore pigtails, see?

1061
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:31,333
We used to call her "twiggy"

1062
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:34,667
because her legs were so skinny.

1063
01:30:37,458 --> 01:30:40,667
Such innocence! They thought
because they sat behind the table

1064
01:30:41,458 --> 01:30:43,333
nobody could see them.

1065
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:50,500
It's hard to believe,
they were already engaged.

1066
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:05,208
She kept giggling
on their wedding day.

1067
01:31:08,208 --> 01:31:12,250
It was probably nerves.
She said her shoes pinched.

1068
01:31:15,958 --> 01:31:18,458
It was her first time in high heels.

1069
01:31:20,333 --> 01:31:22,042
She was 19.

1070
01:31:25,833 --> 01:31:28,750
The judge who married them
spoke these lovely words.

1071
01:31:29,792 --> 01:31:32,333
Too bad she couldn't stop giggling.

1072
01:31:38,667 --> 01:31:43,000
He looks bigger than he is.
It's the suit.

1073
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:48,958
A factory pal lent it to him.
It was tight at the shoulders.

1074
01:31:52,583 --> 01:31:57,208
As soon as it was over,
he took it off and returned it.

1075
01:32:09,208 --> 01:32:11,583
Here they'd been
married for one year.

1076
01:32:12,333 --> 01:32:15,083
You could hardly
tell she was pregnant.

1077
01:32:16,833 --> 01:32:19,458
We were all there
because it was a Sunday.

1078
01:32:20,583 --> 01:32:23,542
We all brought something
for the barbecue.

1079
01:32:23,833 --> 01:32:28,625
We helped unload the bricks
and stuff for another wall

1080
01:32:28,667 --> 01:32:31,833
because they only had one brick wall.
See?

1081
01:32:35,875 --> 01:32:36,958
<i>You</i> see,

1082
01:32:38,833 --> 01:32:43,542
some neighbours who saw
them being taken away

1083
01:32:46,042 --> 01:32:49,875
said that the fire might
not have been intentional.

1084
01:32:53,417 --> 01:32:56,667
But since they destroyed everything
and there was only one brick wall.

1085
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:01,167
There was nothing left.

1086
01:33:03,333 --> 01:33:04,458
Nothing.

1087
01:33:08,292 --> 01:33:10,500
Only these four pictures of them.

1088
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,583
And our memories.

1089
01:33:23,042 --> 01:33:25,625
I'm not saying that she is...

1090
01:33:27,208 --> 01:33:30,250
But the dates more or less match,
don%they?

1091
01:33:31,875 --> 01:33:33,250
And then looking at this picture.

1092
01:33:34,958 --> 01:33:37,708
You realize this girl of yours...

1093
01:33:43,375 --> 01:33:45,458
could well be my granddaughter.

1094
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:02,542
Don't cry.

1095
01:34:03,917 --> 01:34:05,625
It doesn't do any good.

1096
01:34:09,125 --> 01:34:10,792
Take my word for it.

1097
01:34:15,417 --> 01:34:16,917
It doesn't do any good.

1098
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:39,667
Why are you here?

1099
01:34:39,708 --> 01:34:43,000
Your secretary said I'd find you
here. We need to talk.

1100
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:47,250
Right now I'm busy.
Some other time I'll gladly see you.

1101
01:34:47,292 --> 01:34:49,583
Believe me I'd rather not.

1102
01:34:49,625 --> 01:34:51,833
Alicia won't return my calls.

1103
01:34:52,542 --> 01:34:55,667
How about that!
Good for her!

1104
01:34:56,250 --> 01:34:57,917
Is the ship sinking?

1105
01:35:03,167 --> 01:35:06,333
Do you know
what's gotten into Alicia's head?

1106
01:35:08,333 --> 01:35:11,208
I know what ideas
you're trying to put in her head.

1107
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:12,333
Don't be an idiot!

1108
01:35:12,375 --> 01:35:15,542
Had I that kind of influence
on her she wouldn't have married you!

1109
01:35:15,583 --> 01:35:19,500
Of course not! You'd have found
her a husband like yours!

1110
01:35:19,542 --> 01:35:21,833
Your lot should all be wiped clean.

1111
01:35:22,875 --> 01:35:24,167
Like garbage!

1112
01:35:24,583 --> 01:35:27,958
Didn't they do just that!
Swept and buried them!

1113
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,042
Like garbage!

1114
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:32,167
Did you know who Pedro was?

1115
01:35:32,208 --> 01:35:34,917
He was just like you
but in the opposite field!

1116
01:35:34,958 --> 01:35:36,833
Hence the mutual hatred.

1117
01:35:36,875 --> 01:35:39,958
Hatred?
Why should he hate me?

1118
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,792
Actually you're better!
He'd never have asked that question.

1119
01:35:43,833 --> 01:35:48,208
So, you're innocent, right?
You had nothing to do with any of it?

1120
01:35:48,250 --> 01:35:51,583
Maybe you ratted on me,
to ingratiate yourself

1121
01:35:51,625 --> 01:35:53,042
with some friend?

1122
01:35:53,375 --> 01:35:55,708
I would've done so gladly.

1123
01:36:01,083 --> 01:36:02,458
Who told you?

1124
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:04,625
Who?

1125
01:36:05,792 --> 01:36:07,458
So he's disappeared.

1126
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,667
Yes, Rolo. He disappeared.
Vanished.

1127
01:36:13,583 --> 01:36:15,375
Gone forever!

1128
01:36:16,583 --> 01:36:19,250
Nothing. Nothing.
I'm laughing at us.

1129
01:36:21,333 --> 01:36:25,208
Who would denounce him, Rolo,
if they can't prove any of it?

1130
01:36:27,208 --> 01:36:31,167
Everything's fine. The girl's asleep.
The maid's asleep. Relax.

1131
01:36:31,208 --> 01:36:32,458
I'm sorry.

1132
01:36:32,917 --> 01:36:35,667
Stop. Why are you telling me this?

1133
01:36:36,375 --> 01:36:39,125
No! I have nothing to do with it!

1134
01:36:40,625 --> 01:36:43,583
I'm telling you.
I had nothing to do with it.

1135
01:36:44,333 --> 01:36:45,542
Nothing.

1136
01:36:47,792 --> 01:36:50,542
You offered to pick her up
at preschool.

1137
01:36:50,583 --> 01:36:54,000
Because you couldn't make it.
But it's 11:30 pm Alicia!

1138
01:37:59,792 --> 01:38:05,292
<i>No pardon, no amnesty.
We want them alive.</i>

1139
01:38:10,083 --> 01:38:14,750
<i>Now it's become imperative</i>

1140
01:38:22,333 --> 01:38:27,583
<i>that they appear alive,
and the culprits are punished.</i>

1141
01:38:49,417 --> 01:38:55,083
<i>We want our children!</i>

1142
01:39:09,917 --> 01:39:13,792
<i>They took them alive.
We want them back alive.</i>

1143
01:39:23,083 --> 01:39:27,083
FAMILIES OF THE DETAINED
AND MISSING

1144
01:39:40,417 --> 01:39:43,625
AND HER BABY BORN
IN CAPTIVITY

1145
01:39:43,667 --> 01:39:47,417
<i>We need to know
where the missing people are.</i>

1146
01:39:58,167 --> 01:40:00,625
If Gaby's your grandchild,
what do we do?

1147
01:40:24,833 --> 01:40:30,250
It's strange
I always thought that

1148
01:40:31,542 --> 01:40:36,250
I would do anything
to hold on to...

1149
01:40:37,083 --> 01:40:40,292
That I'd be capable...

1150
01:40:41,917 --> 01:40:44,292
of anything as long as...

1151
01:40:48,458 --> 01:40:51,000
As long as everything
remained as it was.

1152
01:40:54,333 --> 01:40:55,708
Strange, isn't it?

1153
01:41:00,333 --> 01:41:03,917
As long as I didn't lose what I love,
yet here I am.

1154
01:41:06,125 --> 01:41:09,000
Rosa, can you come in please?

1155
01:41:09,042 --> 01:41:10,583
- Hi, love.
- Hello dear.

1156
01:41:10,625 --> 01:41:12,333
I'd like you to meet...

1157
01:41:12,375 --> 01:41:14,958
- Not now. I'm busy.
- Please.

1158
01:41:20,875 --> 01:41:23,833
Mrs. Reballo, my husband,
Roberto Ibañez.

1159
01:41:23,875 --> 01:41:25,625
- Hello.
- How do you do?

1160
01:41:31,708 --> 01:41:32,958
Reballo.

1161
01:41:34,542 --> 01:41:36,958
I knew a Reballo back in college.

1162
01:41:38,167 --> 01:41:40,042
A lifetime ago.

1163
01:41:40,958 --> 01:41:43,792
We're not from town.

1164
01:41:55,125 --> 01:41:57,708
Sara could be
Gaby's grandmother.

1165
01:42:01,750 --> 01:42:03,042
What?

1166
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:09,875
Are you out of your mind?

1167
01:42:13,417 --> 01:42:15,125
What's this, a trap?

1168
01:42:15,458 --> 01:42:16,875
In my own house?

1169
01:42:18,292 --> 01:42:21,250
What's the matter with you,
you poor idiot?

1170
01:42:21,708 --> 01:42:23,583
Do you realize what you're doing?

1171
01:42:23,625 --> 01:42:25,542
What is it?
You're scared?

1172
01:42:25,583 --> 01:42:26,792
What do you want?

1173
01:42:26,833 --> 01:42:28,917
Do you want to get rid of the girl?

1174
01:42:28,958 --> 01:42:32,875
There's no need to give her off
to the first looney on the street.

1175
01:42:37,583 --> 01:42:40,667
Get this old bag out of here.
Out of my house!

1176
01:42:40,708 --> 01:42:42,208
Get this out of here!

1177
01:43:31,542 --> 01:43:32,833
Well, I'm leaving.

1178
01:43:35,542 --> 01:43:37,917
Tomorrow, will you call me

1179
01:43:39,083 --> 01:43:40,458
or should I call you?

1180
01:43:42,292 --> 01:43:43,542
I'll call you, Sara.

1181
01:44:05,208 --> 01:44:06,542
See you tomorrow.

1182
01:44:40,125 --> 01:44:41,458
I don't get it.

1183
01:44:43,042 --> 01:44:45,000
What's gotten into you?

1184
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:47,500
What do you want to do with Gaby?

1185
01:44:48,875 --> 01:44:51,708
- I want to know.
- What do you want to know?

1186
01:44:52,875 --> 01:44:54,500
Why she was given to you?

1187
01:44:55,583 --> 01:44:58,792
What did they do to her mother?
Is she alive?

1188
01:44:58,833 --> 01:45:02,375
How would I know?
What am I? A torturer?

1189
01:45:02,417 --> 01:45:04,042
And why should we care?

1190
01:45:04,083 --> 01:45:06,417
We should care. It concerns us.

1191
01:45:09,333 --> 01:45:11,958
You're too scared
to look that woman in the face.

1192
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,542
I don't want to look at her.
I want nothing to do with them!

1193
01:45:16,458 --> 01:45:18,375
Do you know who they are?

1194
01:45:20,583 --> 01:45:21,958
How could you know?

1195
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:24,917
You don't know
what's under your nose!

1196
01:45:26,250 --> 01:45:29,167
Of course I'm scared, you idiot!

1197
01:45:30,542 --> 01:45:31,750
You idiot.

1198
01:45:40,042 --> 01:45:43,750
Some very serious things are
happening. Andrada's missing.

1199
01:45:43,792 --> 01:45:46,958
And I'm in it up to here!
The General is raving mad!

1200
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,250
He says he's going to make them pay.

1201
01:45:50,583 --> 01:45:51,833
We might lose everything.

1202
01:45:51,875 --> 01:45:53,000
We might lose Gaby.

1203
01:45:53,042 --> 01:45:54,833
That one's on you! You!

1204
01:46:11,583 --> 01:46:12,917
What if it is true?

1205
01:46:21,292 --> 01:46:23,625
If the parents are whom you said.

1206
01:46:25,375 --> 01:46:27,000
Would it change anything?

1207
01:46:29,167 --> 01:46:30,333
Would it?

1208
01:46:32,125 --> 01:46:36,375
She's already lost a mother.
You want her to lose another one?

1209
01:46:36,833 --> 01:46:38,292
Is that what you want?

1210
01:46:41,250 --> 01:46:42,125
Listen...

1211
01:46:47,333 --> 01:46:49,500
I know how much you love the girl.

1212
01:46:52,708 --> 01:46:56,583
We're raising her properly,
aren't we?

1213
01:47:00,375 --> 01:47:03,375
- She's better off with us.
- Then it's true.

1214
01:47:16,458 --> 01:47:19,958
Who brought that old woman here?
Who?

1215
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:22,875
You don't even care if it's true.

1216
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:31,542
Well I care!
I'm not doing this to Gaby!

1217
01:47:32,625 --> 01:47:34,667
I took her home,

1218
01:47:34,958 --> 01:47:38,083
because I want to know
if Gaby's her grandchild,

1219
01:47:38,417 --> 01:47:40,292
or someone else's grandchild.

1220
01:47:41,667 --> 01:47:45,833
The grandchild of someone
who hasn't the strength

1221
01:47:45,875 --> 01:47:48,208
to walk around the plaza
with a poster.

1222
01:48:07,792 --> 01:48:09,208
Gaby's not here.

1223
01:48:18,958 --> 01:48:20,167
Where is Gaby?

1224
01:48:21,625 --> 01:48:23,917
- Where is Gaby, Alicia?
- Horrible, isn't it?

1225
01:48:24,375 --> 01:48:27,083
- What's horrible?
- Not knowing where your daughter is!

1226
01:48:29,792 --> 01:48:32,750
- Where's my daughter?
- At your mother's house!

1227
01:48:32,792 --> 01:48:34,000
Where's my daughter?

1228
01:48:34,042 --> 01:48:37,417
I had Rosa take her
to your folks so we could talk.

1229
01:48:37,458 --> 01:48:39,042
Let me go, Roberto!

1230
01:48:41,667 --> 01:48:43,083
Let me go!

1231
01:49:07,583 --> 01:49:08,458
Hello.

1232
01:49:10,208 --> 01:49:11,708
Yes, mother.

1233
01:49:12,708 --> 01:49:15,042
No, I was in the other room.

1234
01:49:17,125 --> 01:49:18,417
Nothing. Nothing.

1235
01:49:25,958 --> 01:49:28,792
Tell her to say goodnight
to me first.

1236
01:49:35,542 --> 01:49:37,625
- Hello, Daddy.
- Hello, my love.

1237
01:49:37,917 --> 01:49:39,292
<i>Can I talk to Mommy?</i>

1238
01:49:39,333 --> 01:49:40,583
She's not...

1239
01:49:40,625 --> 01:49:42,667
- Call her.
- She's coming.

1240
01:49:55,292 --> 01:49:56,500
Will you sleep there?

1241
01:49:56,917 --> 01:49:58,833
<i>With grandma and grandpa.</i>

1242
01:49:59,458 --> 01:50:00,417
Fine.

1243
01:50:00,458 --> 01:50:02,625
<i>But I want to sing to Mommy.</i>

1244
01:50:03,583 --> 01:50:04,708
If...

1245
01:50:05,708 --> 01:50:07,917
If you sing loud she'll hear you.

1246
01:50:11,667 --> 01:50:13,500
<i>U know it by heart. Listen.</i>

1247
01:50:15,167 --> 01:50:18,333
<i>In the land of I don't remember</i>

1248
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,792
<i>I take three steps and I'm lost.</i>

1249
01:50:27,750 --> 01:50:32,458
<i>One step this way
I wonder if I may</i>

1250
01:50:33,833 --> 01:50:36,208
<i>One step over there.</i>

1251
01:50:41,333 --> 01:50:45,417
<i>Oh what a big scare</i>

1252
01:50:52,375 --> 01:50:56,042
<i>In the land of I don't remember</i>

1253
01:50:59,333 --> 01:51:03,208
<i>I take three steps and I'm lost.</i>

1254
01:51:04,833 --> 01:51:07,208
<i>One step backward fast</i>

1255
01:51:08,417 --> 01:51:12,417
<i>And that'll be my last</i>

1256
01:51:12,458 --> 01:51:16,792
<i>Because I no longer know</i>

1257
01:51:17,125 --> 01:51:22,958
<i>Where my other foot will go</i>

1258
01:51:25,125 --> 01:51:28,833
<i>Daddy? Did you hear me?</i>

1259
01:51:30,167 --> 01:51:31,917
<i>Did you like it?</i>

1260
01:51:34,250 --> 01:51:37,042
Yes. I liked it a lot.

1261
01:51:37,083 --> 01:51:39,250
<i>I'm sleepy now.</i>

1262
01:51:40,375 --> 01:51:41,458
Here's a kiss.

1263
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:46,083
<i>Here's one for you
and one for Mommy.</i>

1264
01:51:47,417 --> 01:51:48,792
<i>Good night.</i>

1265
01:51:49,750 --> 01:51:52,042
<i>Should I hang up, Daddy?</i>

1266
01:51:53,917 --> 01:51:57,208
Yes, my love. Hang up.

1267
01:51:57,542 --> 01:51:59,167
<i>Good night, Daddy.</i>

1268
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,583
Good night, love of my life.

1269
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:34,625
<i>In the land of I don't remember</i>

1270
01:52:35,375 --> 01:52:43,125
<i>I take three steps and I'm lost</i>

1271
01:52:44,708 --> 01:52:49,042
<i>One step this way</i>

1272
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,500
<i>I wonder if I may</i>

1273
01:52:54,333 --> 01:52:57,875
<i>One step over there</i>

1274
01:55:17,875 --> 01:55:21,958
