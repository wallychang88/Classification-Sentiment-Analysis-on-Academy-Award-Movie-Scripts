No.

389

to handle trouble.

about your availability.

00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:47,490
Okay, here's the deal.

nobody's shoes.

You need somebody to get you
from point A to point B?

400
00:17:56,235 --> 00:17:57,635
You need someone to make sure

401
00:17:57,637 --> 00:17:58,802
there's no problems
along the way?

402
00:17:58,804 --> 00:18:00,804

to the show on time,

Well, not all the time,

685

She says it when... when I
come home from work sometimes.

You know, she's been
with the kids all day,

How is that?

Salty.

692
00:32:25,938 --> 00:32:29,274
Have you ever considered
becoming a food critic?

693
00:32:31,778 --> 00:32:33,711
No. Not really.

694
00:32:33,713 --> 00:32:35,646
Why? Is there money in that?

695
00:32:35,648 --> 00:32:38,581
I'm just saying you have
a marvelous way with words

696
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,684
when describing food.

697
00:32:40,686 --> 00:32:42,753
"Salty."

698
00:32:42,755 --> 00:32:45,524
So vivid,
one can almost taste it.

699
00:32:46,826 --> 00:32:48,692
Hey, I'm just saying it's salty.

700
00:32:48,694 --> 00:32:49,894
And salt's cheating.

701
00:32:49,896 --> 00:32:52,395
Any cook can make things salty.

702
00:32:52,397 --> 00:32:53,831
To make it taste good
without the salt,

703
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:55,866
with just the other flavors,
that's the trick.

704
00:32:55,868 --> 00:32:57,500
I mean, you take
the basic ingredients...

705
00:32:57,502 --> 00:32:59,569
We should really get going soon
if we expect

706
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:01,571
to get to Pittsburgh by dinner.

707
00:33:01,573 --> 00:33:03,573
Hmm. Hey,
when I was in the Army,

708
00:33:03,575 --> 00:33:05,542
I knew a guy from Pittsburgh.

709
00:33:05,544 --> 00:33:07,845
Except he called it
"Titsburgh."

710
00:33:07,847 --> 00:33:11,316
'Cause he said all
the women there had huge tits.

711
00:33:12,151 --> 00:33:13,818
That's absurd.

712
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,986
Why would women in Pittsburgh
have larger breasts

713
00:33:15,988 --> 00:33:18,722
than, say, women in New York?

714
00:33:18,724 --> 00:33:21,725

however charming it may be
in the tristate area,

756
00:36:04,623 --> 00:36:07,024

784
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:10,054

from one show to the next.

1523
01:15:21,246 --> 01:15:23,080

shouldn't matter to you.

paid 'em off.

Really?
Mm-hmm.

1599
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:38,696
She taught me how to play
on an old spinet.

1600

Soon as I could walk, we'd...

1601

travel around
the Florida Panhandle,

put on my little shows
in parishes and halls.

1603
01:20:47,239 --> 01:20:49,439
Fortunately,
a man who had seen me play

1604
01:20:49,441 --> 01:20:50,708
arranged for me to study

1605
01:20:50,710 --> 01:20:52,743
at the Leningrad Conservatory
of Music.

1606
01:20:52,745 --> 01:20:55,578
I was the first Negro
ever accepted there.

1607
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:58,015
That's where they taught you
all them songs you play?

1608
01:20:58,017 --> 01:21:01,251
Actually, I was trained
to play classical music.

1609
01:21:01,253 --> 01:21:05,524
Brahms, Franz Liszt,
Beethoven, Chopin.

1610
01:21:06,591 --> 01:21:08,859
It's all I ever wanted to play.

1611
01:21:08,861 --> 01:21:11,796
But I was persuaded
by my record company

1612
01:21:11,798 --> 01:21:15,666
to pursue a career
in popular music instead.

1613
01:21:15,668 --> 01:21:18,268
They insisted that audiences
would never accept

1614
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:20,437
a Negro pianist
on a classical stage.

1615
01:21:20,439 --> 01:21:25,341
Wanted to turn me into just
another colored entertainer.

1616
01:21:25,343 --> 01:21:28,746
You know, the guy who's smoking
while he's playing

1617
01:21:28,748 --> 01:21:31,615
and sets a glass of whiskey
on his piano,

1618
01:21:31,617 --> 01:21:34,350
and then complains
because he's not respected

1619
01:21:34,352 --> 01:21:35,753

Personally, I think,

1623
01:21:44,664 --> 01:21:46,463
if you stuck
to the classic stuff,

1624
01:21:46,465 --> 01:21:48,065

01:21:48,067 --> 01:21:49,667

my entire life to play?

Alone.

And rich white people pay me
to play piano for them

feel cultured.

to them.
